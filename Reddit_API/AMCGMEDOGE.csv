0,"A Theory of Everything AMC: Wanda, AMC, the SEC, and Lawsuits",1621463847.0,"Disclaimer: Everything that is about to follow is speculation. It is purely a theory of mine based on known facts and common sense. Any dates included are to provide context. They do not indicate the beginning, middle, or end of the impending squeeze.

Disclaimer #2: I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, I just really like this stock.

TL;DR- Wanda, AMC, and the SEC are working together to build a case against the major short sellers committing blatant fraud daily that is suppressing the price of AMC stock. Wanda and AMC will stand to make a lot of money in lawsuits for capital losses. Meanwhile, the SEC will be able to prosecute fraudulent entities using information shared by AMC.

The Players:

Wanda America Entertainment- Before February of 2021, Wanda had voting stake in AMC and was the single largest institutional shareholder of AMC. In early February 2021, Wanda converted class B common stock to class A common stock, which allowed them to sell shares on the open market. On March 19-20, 2021, Wanda sold 15.6 million shares of AMC stock, reducing their holdings from 8.8% of AMC common stock to 6.8% of AMC common stock. Pay attention to those dates

AMC Entertainment- Led by CEO Adam Aron, AMC has staved off bankruptcy during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have raised a total of 752 million dollars from direct offerings in 2021. That is in addition to the funds raised in december 2020. This influx of capital has put AMC into a position that they can maintain operation at current levels until the end of 2022, per their Q1 2021 earnings call. The first dilution of 2021 put an additional 63.3 million shares on the market. That was completed on January 27, 2021. The second dilution was the ATM offering program that completed the sale of 43 million shares from April 27 to May 12. Remember these dates too.

Securities and Exchange Commission- As the lead regulating agency for the stock market, the SEC is supposed to legislate, investigate, and prosecute any entity committing securities fraud. We vilify them, and rightfully so. They have taken a sideline seat and watched as we battled back from our own 1 yard line to be 1st and goal today. Their only interest in all of this is to mitigate the effect on our economy as a whole and to prosecute the offending parties. In order to do that they need evidence. Not just evidence of when and what (dates, naked shorting amount, illegal FTD resets, etc), but also the WHO. We all have our sights on Citadel, but they are not the only complicit player here. This is systemic and market-wide. AMC and GME are not the only securities affected by this, but that are the most public. They are also the ones that can provide information that the SEC desperately needs.

The Game:

Remember when I said to pay attention to the dates before? Well, lets dig into those.

January 27- This was D-day for the HFs. We had them cornered, a squeeze was imminent. Share price rocketed to over $20 a share, trading halts comprised most of the market hours, brokers weren't allowing people to buy, and Apes were throwing shit all over the walls with excitement. Marge was dialing. During all of this, at the peak of all peaks, with us getting ready to get out of the atmosphere, AMC announced the 63 million share dilution. The following day, AMC plummeted to the 10-14 range, and started its descent back down to $5 a share. Why would they do this now? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

March 18-20- On March 18th, AMC is on the rise. We are about to break a critical resistance level at $14.50. Intraday, we break that wall. We are all watching patiently to get our tendies out of the fryer. It feels like January 27th all over again. Then, March 19th comes and instead of going up, share price drops. Not as heavily as on the 27th, but it doesnt continue the upward trend. All of a sudden shares available to borrow goes from 0 to millions. Apes are confused. It doesn't make sense. We broke the wall. it's time to move. Maybe it's just the last breath of the HFs before they let it run and Marge calls. March 20th rolls around, and again, the share price drops. This time, we crash below the $12.50 support level. In the following days, we come back down to the 10-11 dollar range, where we sat until the end of April. We later found out through 13F filings that Wanda sold 15 million shares, stalling our ascent and bringing us back down to earth. Why would a company who stands to gain billions from a squeeze do this? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

End of April 2021- Once again, we are on the rise. Not quite to the $14.50 break point, but we are in a streak of green days, shares available to borrow are almost gone, and cost to borrow is skyrocketing when they are available. It feels like January and March again. We're getting ready to break 12.50 and gap up to the 14s again. Then, AMC announces its ATM offering program. Once again, from the 27th of april through the end of May, we drop back to the 10-11 dollar range. We found out at the Q1 earnings that during this period of descent, AMC had sold over 15 million shares onto the market, raising a significant amount of capital. Once again, we plummet back to earth. Why would a company sacrifice billions in profits off of the ATM offering to sell all of it's remaining sellable shares at 9.50-10.50 a share? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

Where are we at today- Once again, we are getting ready to break the resistance levels, and shares available to borrow are somehow appearing out of nowhere. Borrow rates have dropped 75 percent in a week, and every time we push that level of resistance, we get pulled back down. Does this sound familiar? I think Wanda is unloading another block of shares. This is horribly bad for us right? Can't be good? Wrong. This was always the plan, it was always the game. They're adding shorty rocket fuel. FOMO is kicking in. Retail is seeing a huge increase in liquidity as new buyers join in for liftoff. It is the perfect time to drop shares if you are intentionally delaying the squeeze. Those shares are gone almost immediately. Literally, if they sell at open, even the full 30 million would get eaten up in the first hour of trading. In order to figure out why they would delay the squeeze, we need to look at the playbook.

The Playbook:

AMC and Wanda's goal throughout these last 5 months has been to build a case for the mother of all legal claims against the entities short selling the stock with synthetic shares. Each time we reach a breaking point for the good, they are keeping the SP down as they gather the information they need to file a lawsuit. I graduated with a political science degree, with the aim of going to law school, so I have a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to legal proceedings. Having said that, this is what you need to prove damages in a civil lawsuit.

1.) Who- Who was the offending party that caused the damage?

2.) When- During what period or at what time did they cause you the damage?

3.) How- What did they do that caused you to incur damages?

4.) Damages incurred- You need to be able to define the amount of loss incurred due to the actions of the offending party. In this case, its a pecuniary damage (money lost).

The plays:

1.) Share count- In order to identify the who and the how, AMC needs to be able to prove which entities wronged them, and the amount of damage EACH of them caused. IE, how many shares did they short using malpractice? (naked shorting, FTD resets, etc) The share count does this for them. In order to disseminate voting materials, they need to know the information of who owns the shares of stock, how many they own, and have the contact information to send out voting materials. This gives them the who and the factor to multiply damages incurred per share against.

2.) Delay annual meeting- I firmly believe AMC delayed the meeting because of the sheer amount of shares they counted. The last thing a company wants to do is go into a critical vote with an inflated number of shares. In order to get anything on the ballot to pass, they need a majority of shareholders to approve. If the amount of shares and votes is inflated, they could potentially see all of their ballot items fail to pass.

3.) Involve the SEC- When they knew the who and amount of shares, I believe AMC got the SEC involved. They were able to provide concrete evidence to the SEC of the fraud that was ongoing since December. The SEC needed that information to file legal proceedings. Keep in mind, they need the same things AMC does, minus the damages incurred, to bring a case against the malpracticing firms. At this point, the SEC can actively watch the actions of the offending parties in real time. Building a case until the next share count. In addition, this gives AMC the ability to follow with a civil lawsuit using the SECs findings as the How of their claim. Here's the bonus, the SEC will be able to show AMC the how during the time of the 43 million dilution. These illegal activities were going on during a share dilution, directly affecting the share price AMC should have gotten for their shares sold.

4.) 2nd share recount- I think the SEC advised AMC to conduct another recount for a few reasons. 1.) the illegal activity ramped up from Janurary to April, and the actual share count would have undoubtedly increased in this period, and 2.) It allows the SEC to track another data point while getting ready for the market implosion this could cause. It also delays a notification to the public of just how broken the system is. Now, when AMC announces the share count, the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will pursue, naming the defendants.

5.) Timing of dilutions- If AMC diluted during or after the squeeze, they wouldn't be able to correctly identify damages incurred and when they occurred. By having Wanda and AMC dilute when share price was not inflated, it gives a concrete timeframe of when they were damaged, as well as a count of shares that form the basis of the damage claim (15 million for Wanda, and 103 million for AMC).

4th and Goal (how it ends):

On June 2nd, AMC has to finish their share count so they can disseminate materials. Adam Aron has already stated he will make the share count public. When he announces the total shares counted, it will clearly show the blatant manipulation and illegal activities. Retail will FOMO, institutions will FOMO, and large private investors will FOMO. If you want confirmation that this was the end play, look for an announcement of a share recall, a formal investigation, or both with the announcement.

When they recall the shares, the MMs will need to get real shares, and only real shares, back from the HF before the date specified. This will ignite the margin calls and form the catalyst from the squeeze. The squeeze will be squoze, in theory. (Again, no dates, shhhh)

When the squeeze is over, AMC can now identify just how much they were damaged. They now have the who and when (share recount), the how (SEC investigation), and the damages incurred (delta between share price at market offering and top of the squeeze). A civil lawsuit will follow.

At any point after June 2nd, the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will have and identify the offending parties. Here is the beauty, they can file for an immediate injunction to take control over the offending parties assets. In fact, this is common in legal proceedings involving malpractice. You have evidence the offending party is committing illegal acts, so you stop them from continuing them during legal proceedings.

Confirmation bias time: Why would Wanda and AMC sell shares pre-squeeze? Remember I said you would find out below? Well buckle up. Imagine the shares you have now, and knowing that you could get the maximum gains possible (the top of the top peak), for your shares. That is the position AMC and Wanda have put themselves into. it is honestly genius if you really think about it. They don't have to time the sales. Just watch it go, and when the dust settles, they can name their price from HISTORICAL FACT. I think we would all take this option. AMC and Wanda stand to make billions from this from the way they have played this game.

Thank you if you made it this far. This was a labor of love and took some time. If you disagree with the above, any of it, let me know. This is just a THEORY. It makes sense though, doesn't it?!

Beebs

**EDIT #1: IF YOU WANTED MORE CONFIRMATION THAT THIS THEORY MIGHT END UP BEING PROVEN RIGHT, LOOK NO FURTHER. I AM SHAKING AS I TYPE THIS.**

**Thank you to Corinth1982 and ReturnoftheBri on Stocktwits for pointing this out to me. I love you both for this one.**

**(rubs hands)- Remember how a part of the process for bringing a case is proving damages? Remember how to prove damages, you need to prove that you have a quantitative loss? The best way to do this is to sell during a period where the illegal activity is holding the SP down. I present to you Exhibits A and B (click the links below, then go to the ownership dropdown and select sellers). They detail massive INSTITUTIONAL sales of both AMC and GME this week. Amongst sellers on both stocks is a full closeout by Susquehanna for both. This is the confirmation bias I needed today. I hope it is what you needed too. We are so close. Teetering on the edge close.**

Edit #2: i cannot express the excitement i felt when i read wanda had indeed sold shares on the 13th, 17th, and 18th of this month. With only 10,000 left, we have almost no tutes to slow us on the way up now. Part one of my theory has been proven right.

Also, i want to congratulate all you crayon eating, smooth brain, diamond handed, diamond hearted, banana hoarding apes. You have done what no fund can do. You have done what no government has done. You stood at the precipice of the mother of all tute exodus’ and you held. Think about that. I didnt run the numbers, but tute sales in the last two weeks have to amount to at least 80-100 mil shares. Combine that with the hundreds of millions of shares shorted, and almost any other stock would be sitting at $5 right now. Not us. Never us. We buy and hold. I love you all. Seriously the outpouring of support has been unreal.

From the release:

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE2021-54**

*Washington D.C., March 29, 2021 —*

The Securities and Exchange Commission awarded more than $500,000 to a whistleblower who raised concerns internally before submitting a tip to the Commission. The whistleblower's information and assistance allowed the Commission and another agency to quickly file actions, shutting down an ongoing fraudulent scheme.

The whistleblower's information prompted an internal investigation by the company, which then reported to an outside agency, which in turn provided the information to the SEC. Separately, the whistleblower also reported to the SEC within 120 days of reporting the violations internally to the company. Under the ""safe harbor"" provision of the SEC's whistleblower rules, the SEC treats the whistleblower's information as though it had been submitted to the SEC at the same time it was internally reported as long as the whistleblower also reports the information to the SEC within 120 days of the internal report.

The first one being the WSJ article covering BlackRock, where the fed has tapped them to purchase bonds for the government. These bonds consist of mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds- NOT TREASURIES. While this does not destroy the concept within the post, it DOES remove a link between the speculative relationship of BlackRock and Citadel. Citadel is still shorting bonds, other hedge funds are shorting bonds, BlackRock just isn't buying treasuries from the government. There are plenty of other financial institutions lending out their treasury bonds.

We are still discussing the post and I will make updates as they are available.

STAY TUNED!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

***TL;DR- Citadel and friends have shorted the treasury bond market to oblivion using the repo market. Citadel owns a company called Palafox Trading and uses them to EXCLUSIVELY short & trade treasury securities. Palafox manages one fund for Citadel - the Citadel Global Fixed Income Master Fund LTD. Total assets over $123 BILLION and 80% are owned by offshore investors in the Cayman Islands. Their reverse repo agreements are ENTIRELY rehypothecated and they CANNOT pay off their own repo agreements until someone pays them, first. The ENTIRE global financial economy is modeled after a fractional reserve system that is beginning to experience THE MOTHER OF ALL MARGIN CALLS.***

My fellow apes,

After writing [Citadel Has No Clothes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I couldn't shake one MAJOR issue: *why do they have a balance sheet full of financial derivatives instead of physical shares? Even Melvin keeps their derivative exposure to roughly 20%...(*[*whalewisdom.com*](https://whalewisdom.com/)*, Melvin Capital 13F - 2020)*

The concept of a hedging instrument is to protect against price fluctuations. Hopefully you get it right and make a good prediction, but to have a portfolio with literally 80% derivatives.... absolute INSANITY.. it's is the complete OPPOSITE of what should happen.. so WHAT is going on?

Let's break this into 4 parts:

1. ***Repurchase & Reverse Repurchase agreements***
2. ***Treasury Bonds***
3. ***Palafox Trading***
4. ***Short-seller Endgame***

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Ok, 4 easy steps... as simple as possible.

***Step 1: Repurchase & Reverse Repurchase agreements.***

*WTF are they?*

A Repurchase Agreement is much like a loan. If you have a big juicy banana worth $1,000,000 and need some quick cash, a repo agreement might be right for you. Just take that banana to a pawn shop and pawn it for a few days, borrow some cash, and buy your banana back later (plus a few tendies in interest). This creates a liability for you because you have to buy it back, unless you want to default and lose your big, beautiful banana. Regardless, you either buy it back or lose it. A reverse repo is how the *pawn shop* would account for this transaction.

*Why do they matter?*

Repos and reverse repos are the *LIFEBLOOD* of global financial liquidity. They allow for SUPER FAST conversions from securities to cash. The repo agreement I just described is happening daily with hedge funds and commercial banks. *EDIT: Inserting the quote from George Gammon: according to his calculations, the estimated total amount of repos are $4 TRILLION, DAILY.* The NY Fed, alone, submitted [$40.354 BILLION](https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/tomo-results-display?SHOWMORE=TRUE&startDate=01/01/2000&enddate=01/01/2000) for repo agreements on (3/29). This amount represents the ONE DAY REPO due on 3/30. So yeah, SUPER short term loans- usually a few days. It's probably not a surprise that back in 2008 the go-to choice of collateral for repo agreements was mortgage backed securities..

[Lehman Brothers](https://www.cpajournal.com/2016/08/01/lehman-brothers-mf-globals-misuse-repurchase-agreements-reformed-accounting-standards/) went bankrupt because they fraudulently classified repo agreements as sales. You can do your own research on this, but I'll give you the quick n' dirty:

Lehman would go to a bank and ask for cash. The bank would ask for collateral in return and Lehman would offer mortgage backed securities (MBS). *It's great having so many mortgages on your balance sheet, but WTF good does it do if you have to wait 30 YEARS for the cash*.... So Lehman gave their collateral to the bank and recorded these loans as *sales* instead of payables, with no intention of buying them back. This *EXTREMELY* overstated their revenue. When the market started realizing how sh\*tty these ""AAA"" securities actually were (thanks to Michael BRRRRRRRRy & friends), they were no longer accepted as collateral for repo loans. We all know what happened next.

The interest rate in 2008 on repos started climbing as the cost of borrowing money went through the roof. This happens because **the collateral is no longer attractive compared to cash.** My favorite bedtime story is how the Fed stepped in and bought all of the mean, toxic assets to save the US economy.. They literally paid Fannie & Freddie over [$190 billion in bailouts..](https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/initiatives/1-housing-and-economic-recovery-act-of-2008)

A few years later, [MF Global](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42091.pdf) would suffer the same fate when their European repo exposure triggered a massive margin call. Their foreign exposure to repo agreements was nearly **4.5x** their total equity.. Both Lehman and MF Global found themselves in a major liquidity conundrum and were forced into bankruptcy. Not to mention the other losses that were incurred by other financial institutions... check this list for [bailout totals](https://projects.propublica.org/bailout/programs).

But.... did you know this happened AGAIN in 2019?

https://preview.redd.it/9htr7vn8g9q61.jpg?width=912&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25995c33d0056f6108471baa373d1a371b5d0cd5

Instead of the gradual increase in rates, the damn thing spiked to **10% OVERNIGHT**. This little blip almost ruined the whole show. It's a HUGE red flag because it shows how the system MUST remain in tight control: one slip and it's game over.

The reason for the spike was once again due to a lack of liquidity. The [federal reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-happened-in-money-markets-in-september-2019-20200227.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20repo%20market%2C%20there,supply%20mismatch%20in%20the%20market) stated there were two main catalysts (click the link): both of which removed the necessary funds that would have fueled the repo market the following day. Basically, their checking account was empty and their utility bill bounced.

It became apparent that ANOTHER infusion of cash was necessary to prevent the whole damn system from collapsing. *The reason being: institutions did NOT have enough excess liquidity on hand*. Financial institutions needed a fast replacement for the MBS, and J-POW had just the right thing.. $FED go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

[\\""but don't say it's QE..\\""](https://preview.redd.it/7mmmhqf9g9q61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=790466a2979a194facb57919d762cacca815a384)

***Step 2: Treasury Bonds***

Ever heard of the bond market? Well it's the redheaded step-brother of the STONK market.

The US government sells you a treasury bond for $1,000 and promises to pay you interest depending on how long you hold it. Might be 1%, might be 3%; might be 3 months, might be 10 years. Regardless, the point is that purchasing the US Treasury bond, in conjunction with mortgage backed securities, allowed the fed to keep pumping unlimited liquid tendies into the repo market. Surely, liquidity won't be an issue anymore, right?

Now... take the repo scenario from the Lehman Brothers story, but instead of using ONLY mortgage backed securities, add in the US Treasury bond: primarily the 10-year. Note that MBS are still prevalent at 19.1% of all repo transactions, but the US Treasury bond now represents a whopping 67%.

https://preview.redd.it/t5jkjj5bg9q61.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&s=8add42402770ffcb76f2cfcb56e4f28196a42e96

For now, just know that the US Treasury has replaced the MBS as the dominant source of liquidity in the repo market.

***Step 3: Palafox Trading***

Ever heard of Palafox Trading? Me either. It's pretty much meant to be that way.

Palafox Trading is a market maker for repurchase agreements. Initially, they appear to be an innocent trading company, but their financial statements revealed a little secret:

https://preview.redd.it/8w7uhymcg9q61.png?width=723&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2350bca6b44c8d470904525dc7dfca914cc7f7a

Are you KIDDING ME?... I should have known...

OF COURSE Citadel has their own private repo market..

Who else is in this cesspool?!

https://preview.redd.it/ah5775qdg9q61.png?width=360&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad4ab23bdee3739d06f4443e97da4c6172199590

[I made this using the financial statement listed above, showing all beneficiaries of the GFIL](https://preview.redd.it/hhkco0ueg9q61.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bdb80678d270dd17990312d5024542e61a6db4a)

Everything rolls into the [Citadel Global Fixed Income Master Fund](https://aum13f.com/firm/citadel-advisors-llc?view_all=fund)... This controls **$123,218,147,399** (THAT'S BILLION) in assets under management... I know offshore accounts are technically legal for hedge funds.... but when you look at the itemized holdings of these funds on Citadel's most recent [form ADV](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/148826/PDF/148826.pdf), it gives me chills..

[Form ADV](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/148826/PDF/148826.pdf) page 105-106....

https://preview.redd.it/ho4j0oghg9q61.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=147c10a38cfc2857b4b2691fe70f088a88e83091

Ok... ok.... let me get this straight....

1. The repo market provides IMMEDIATE liquidity to hedge funds and other financial institutions
2. After the MBS collapse in 2008, the US Treasury replaced it as the liquid asset of choice
3. Citadel owns 100% of Palafox Trading which is a market maker for repo agreements
4. This market maker provides liquidity to the Global Fixed Income Master Fund LTD (GFIL) through Citadel Advisors
5. 80% of its $123,218,147,399 in assets under management belong to entities in the Cayman Islands

Ok.....I tore the [bermuda, paradise, and panama papers](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=citadel&e=&commit=Search) apart and found that all of these funds boil down to just a few managers, but can't pin anything on them for money laundering... However, if there EVER were a case for it, I'd be extremely suspicious of this one...

The level of shade on all this is INCREDIBLE... There should be NO ROOM for a investment pool as big as Citadel to hide this sh\*t.... absolutely ridiculous..

The fact that there is so much foreign influence over our bond & repo market, which controls the liquidity of our country, is VERY concerning..

***Step 4: Short-seller Endgame***

Alright, I know this is a lot to take in..

I've been writing this post for a week, so reading it all at one time is probably going to make your head explode.. But now we can finally start putting all of this together.

Ok, remember how I explained that the repo rate started to rise in '08 because **the collateral was no longer attractive compared to cash? That means there wasn't enough liquidity in the system.** Well this time the OPPOSITE effect is happening. Ever since March 2020, the short-term lending rate (repo rate) has nearly dropped to ***0.0%....***

[https:\/\/www.newyorkfed.org\/markets\/treasury-repo-reference-rates](https://preview.redd.it/ui9welgkg9q61.png?width=330&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbd5b9501f7bbc386fa62e152ca2b090173692a2)

So the fed is printing free money, the repo market is lending free money, and there's basically NO difference between the collateral that's being lent and the cash that's being received.. With all this free money going around, it's no wonder why the price of the 10 year treasury has been declining.

In fact, hedge funds are SO confident that the 10 year treasury will continue to decline, that they've **SHORTED THE 10-YEAR BOND MARKET.** I'm not talking about speculative shorting, I mean shorting it to oblivion like they've shorted stocks.

Don't believe me?

Hedge funds like Citadel Advisors must first locate the treasury bond in order to swap them for cash in the repo market. It's extremely difficult to do this with the fed because they're tied up in government BS, so they locate a lender in the market. These consist of other commercial banks and hedge funds.

**NOTE: I MADE A COMMENT ABOUT BLACKROCK SUPPLYING TREASURY BONDS AND THIS IS NOT TRUE. UPON FURTHER REVIEW ( CREDIT** u/dontfightthevol **) THESE BONDS CONSIST OF MBS AND CORPORATE BONDS. WHILE THE US TREASURY DEPARTMENT IS INVOLVED, THEY ARE NOT SUPPLYING TREASURY BONDS.**

So financial institutions keep treasuries on reserve for hedgies like Citadel to short. Citadel comes along and asks for the bond, they throw it into Palafox Trading and collect their cash. So what happens when they need to pay for their repo agreement? Surely to GOD there are enough bonds floating around, right? **Not unless hedge funds like Citadel have shorted more bonds than there are available.**

Here's the evidence.

There have been 3 instances over the past year where the repo rate dipped below the ""failure"" rate of -3.0%. On March 4th 2021, the repo rate hit [\-4.25%](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-bonds-repo/explainer-u-s-treasury-sell-off-spills-over-to-repo-market-idUSL2N2L32FR) which means that investors were willing to PAY someone **4.25%** interest to lend THEIR OWN MONEY in exchange for a 10 year treasury bond.

This is a major signal of a squeeze in the treasury market. It's MAJOR desperation to find bonds. With the federal reserve purchasing them monthly from the open market, it leaves room for a shortage when the repo call hits. If commercial banks and hedge funds haven't purchased more treasuries since first lending them out, short sellers simply cannot cover unless they go into the market and PAY the bond holder for their bond. It's literally the same story as all of the heavily shorted stocks.

Still not convinced?

At the end of 2020, Palafox Trading listed **$31,257,102,000 (BILLION)** in GROSS repo agreements. **$30,576,918,000** (BILLION) were directly related to repurchasing treasury bonds....

[https:\/\/sec.report\/CIK\/0001284170](https://preview.redd.it/m3lg8nzog9q61.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=747e1f671323227be9c0220aec18f8ec245d3cf1)

But what about their Reverse Repurchase agreements? Don't they have assets to BUY treasury bonds?SURE.. Take a look..

[https:\/\/sec.report\/CIK\/0001284170](https://preview.redd.it/wt8fbrlrg9q61.png?width=371&format=png&auto=webp&s=72f939a98e0dc34a08b8a58e89ef68045a8e78a7)

SeE tHeRe? I tOlD yOu ThEy HaD iT cOvErEd..

Yeaaaah... now read the fine print.

[I know the totals are slightly different than the balance above, but they're both from 2020. It's just how they are presented. Check for yourself. \(https:\/\/sec.report\/CIK\/0001284170\)](https://preview.redd.it/5enfigytg9q61.png?width=354&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab613f3bf46064c674bce68766a90e2b2613a2ec)

So no, they don't have it covered. Why? Because our POS financial system allows for rehypothecation, that's why. It's a big fancy word for using amounts owed to you as collateral for another transaction. In the event that the party defaults, **SO DO YOU**.

This means that the securities which Palafox is waiting to receive, have ALREADY been pledged to pay off the bonds they currently OWE to someone else.

Does this sound familiar? Promising to repay something with something you don't already have? Basically you need to wait on Ted, to repay Steve, to repay Jan, to repay Mark, to repay you, so you can repay Fred, so Fred can.... Yeah, REAAAAL secure..

OH, and by the way, the problem is getting WORSE.

Here's Palafox's financial statements in **2018:**

[https:\/\/sec.report\/CIK\/0001284170](https://preview.redd.it/lrtryfivg9q61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d850854f0fbcf0a5d701374ed5634d6eaf036919)

**And 2019:**

[https:\/\/sec.report\/CIK\/0001284170](https://preview.redd.it/zjxda0swg9q61.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c124bfd8b4f4a9162b2a2b65ade4b690b4dfadd)

The amount in **2020** is STILL +100% greater than 2019, AFTER netting (which is even more bullsh\*t).

[https:\/\/sec.report\/CIK\/0001284170](https://preview.redd.it/xjss7dzxg9q61.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ff71bf6631f9e665378a0f4a623a95e3aecb264)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

All of this made me wonder what the FICC's balance is for treasury deposits... For those of you that don't know, the FICC is a branch of the DTCC that deals with government securities.

Just like the updated DTC rule for supplemental liquidity deposits being calculated throughout the day, the FICC also calculates this amount as it relates to treasury securities multiple times throughout the day.

Would you be surprised that the FICC has $47,000,000,000 (BILLION) just in DEPOSITS for unsettled treasury bonds? **$47,000,000,000!?!?!?**

**CAN YOU IMAGINE HOW ASTRONOMICAL THE ACTUAL MARGIN MUST BE?!**

https://preview.redd.it/zrkpzdb1h9q61.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=64f6b10aca2566bcf9b5d560967af3715104b839

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

There is TOO much evidence, from TOO many separate events, pointing to the imminent default of something big. That's all this is going to take. When Ted can't repay Steve, it means the panic has already started. Just look at how easy it was for the repo rate to spike overnight in 2019..

We are already starting to see the consequences of the SLR update with Archegos, Nomura, and Credit Suisse. This is just a taste of what's to come.. and now we know the bond market represents an even BIGGER catalyst in triggering this event.. and it's happening already.

With that being said, things finally started to make sense... Citadel doesn't NEED shares if their investment strategy to go short on EVERYTHING instead of going long. Why bother owning shares? Financial institutions and other asset managers simply lend them to you when you need to pony up a margin call for stocks and bonds..

Their HFT systems allow them to manipulate the market in their favor so there's NO way they could fail.... unless.... a bunch of degenerates all decided to ignore taking profits...

But that would NEVER happen, right?

...wrong...

we just like the stonks

**Are Citadel and Friends shorting GME directly?** *YES*, but that alone is not enough to drive down GME price drastically without significant increase in reported short interest.

**Are Citadel and Friends hiding short interest thorough OTC (dark pools) and other shady options mechanisms?** *Likely yes*, but will not explore in this post.

**Are Citadel and Friends shorting ETFs directly that contain GME?** *YES*, but that’s not the entire picture

**Isn’t shorting an ETF that only contains 1-5% GME expensive and cost prohibitive?**

*NO*, and here’s why.

# Operational Shorting – Naked Shorting ETFs at a PROFIT for Citadel

**What Is an ETF?** An exchange traded fund (ETF) is like a basket of stocks that can be purchased or sold on an exchange like a single regular stock.

**Rise of ETFs** are concerning since they constitute a disproportionately high amount of US trading volume. 25% of all US equity trading volume, but only constitute 5% market cap.

**Why is there such a high ETF trading volume?** Answer: Its profitable for the APs

**What is an AP?** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange traded fund (ETF) like big banks or market makers like Citadel

**How does Citadel make money on selling / buying ETFs?**

**Arbitrage**. The buying and selling of securities in different markets or forms in order to take advantage of the differing prices of the same asset.

&#x200B;

**Arbitrage Analogy:**

Think of ETFs like XRT as a fruit basket, and the stocks they contain fruits. Say the XRT fruit basket was $6 and contained a banana (GME), orange, and apple. And individual bananas are $1, oranges are $2, and apples are $3.  The total cost of buying the fruits individually is the NAV (net asset value) which in this case is also $6. Citadel can make their own fruit baskets by buying individual fruits but they wouldn’t make too much money since the price of the fruit basket are usually similar to the NAV. In recent years Citadel and other APs have found a much more profitable strategy – Operational Shorting.

https://preview.redd.it/ws8rv6rw68p61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=a03cfb7f45ca8f7b93602f91a3cf3e9c73c99e63

**Operational Shorting Analogy:**

Citadel has the ability to NAKED SELL nonexistent fruit baskets (XRT / IWM) at $6 but not deliver on them until 6 days later. Flooding the market with tons of promised fruit baskets can drive down the price of individual fruits (bananas went from $1 -> $0.5, oranges to $1.8, apples to $2.7), only to buy back the individual fruits 6 days later at a CHEAPER NAV and deliver those fruit baskets to you. That fruit basket that was delivered to buyers only cost Citadel (0.5 + 1.8 + 2.7 = $5) to make, netting them a cool $1 while also driving down the price of bananas by 50%.

&#x200B;

# Operational Shorting by Citadel

When faced with “excess buying” pressure for ETF shares, **the AP/MM can sell shares “naked” and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for “bona fide” market making)**

Market makers, often commercial banks or hedge funds, create ETFs for their issuers by buying the securities that the funds are supposed to represent. ***But they've discovered that they can make a predictable return by delaying the purchases and selling you nonexistent exchange-traded fund shares that they will create later***. These transactions are a form of shorting – Operational Shorting as coined by Richard Evans, Professor at the Darden School of Business.

&#x200B;

# Okay.. What does this mean for GME?

**Citadel is willing to NAKED SHORT ANY ETF containing GME**, and by extension the **ENTIRE MARKET** (will show later) to drive down the price of GME.

https://preview.redd.it/2s92as8y68p61.png?width=1645&format=png&auto=webp&s=9938f5b88ba8ea2b6f504c2cfa29a1f9b783a02c

# If Citadel Shorted ETFs to Drive Down GME Price, Why Did It Go Up Today?

SEC Rules that Citadel must deliver on naked ETF shorts by T+6 by buying back the underlying shares. Today lines up just under this restriction from the first time IWM was shorted on Mar 18.

https://preview.redd.it/iu8zg41z68p61.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb8e7f1d8d8143197541307f6c7a8447e2178ff

# Should Operational Shorting Make Apes Scared? 

**Operational Shorting HAS NO PREDICTIVE VALUE ON THE PRICE OF UNDERLYING ASSETS 1 WEEK LATER. Unless apes scared and paper hand**

Citadel MUST buy back the underlying stock on ETFs sold short at (T+6) WHICH MEANS IF YOU DON'T PAPER HAND THEY MIGHT HAVE TO BUY BACK GME AT A HIGHER PRICE THAN WHEN THEY STARTED SHORTING

https://preview.redd.it/ebgkm6poa8p61.png?width=1589&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2baba870a4d16123285c530129e8658166f52c2

# Conclusion

Findings from Evan’s paper on ETF Short Interest and Failures-to-Deliver: Naked Short-Selling or Operational Shorting?

>If higher levels of FTDs spill over from one ETF to another within the same AP or across different APs with overlap in their ETF market making activities, **operational shorting could increase financial instability**. When we examine the impact of FTDs across different ETFs, **we find evidence consistent with this contagion-like effect**. Moreover, we also find that **APs that are closer to their maximum regulatory leverage limit are more likely to operationally short**. These results suggest ETF trading relies on an inter-connected network of liquidity providers which, at times, pursue positively correlated **trading strategies that can be detrimental to the overall market.**”

&#x200B;

**Additional Findings on Operational Shorting and Financial Linkages**

* APs who are operationally short in one ETF, are more likely to be operationally short in other ETFs for which they serve as an AP (intra-AP linkage)
   * Proof in point: Citadel began shorting XRT to drive down the price of GME in Feb, and more recently have shorted IWM to drive down the price of GME again
* A given AP has higher operational shorting when other APs have higher levels of operational shorting (inter-AP linkage)
   * Higher operational shorting by Citadel linked to higher operational shorting by other APs
* Looking at regulatory constraints on AP leverage, **we also find that the closer a firm is to its regulatory leverage limit, the higher levels of operational shorting.** **This is consistent with a contagion-like effect that could cause entire market instability.**

&#x200B;

# CITADEL AND FRIENDS ARE FUCKED AND ON THE BRINK.

# UPTICK IN RECENT ETF NAKED SHORTING SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE CLOSER TO THEIR REGULATORY LEVERAGE LIMITS.

# EXPECT MORE NAKED SHORTING OF ETFS BUT THESE ADDITIONAL SHORTING MAY LEAD TO ENTIRE MARKET INSTABILITY

# I WILL HOLD MY BANANAS TO THE MOON

**Edit:** To clarify, my summary is that naked shorting of ETFs is easy and profitable for the APs. And while operational shorting has no net effect on the NAV of all the stocks in an ETF, they have realized it is an effective way to drive and magnify the direction of a single stock in the ETF in the direction they want it to go via other methods like direct shorting of GME.

Translation: today's rise may have been premediated by the APs since they knew they had to cover from shorting IWM 5 days ago. **Whether GME keeps rising after today no one can answer and specific dates don't matter since APs have multiple strategies to delay or shorten the delivery dates on shares sold short**. THE most effective way for **me** to deal with APs who have become more and more leveraged is to **just buy and hold**. 💎 💎 💎

EDIT(3/5/21): Foreword to my edit: I still think, that the Squeeze happens in the timespan I stated (between march 15th and march 19th). I found a lot more catalysts, that I talked about in the livestreams I list down below. I am actually more confident than ever, that I was infact right with the date. I talk about the AI, even many more catalysts, that I didn't talk about here, the XRT and why it's not the dividens, but the rebalance that's important. If you want to know more about my thoughts on all of this and want a better explanation, I can recommend watching it.

&#x200B;

I responded to a lot of questions and critique in 2 Livestreams on YouTube:

1. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32f9CPxGW10&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32f9CPxGW10&t=4s)
2. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Vc-irYsL4&](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99Vc-irYsL4&)

&#x200B;

I am going to finish my break and will respond to more questions regarding my thoughts and this DD in a Livestream or Video of my own!

&#x200B;

More catalysts that I talked about in the Livestreams and that I am also going to talk about in my own Videos/Streams:

&#x200B;

* EDIT 03/13: **The State Street Global Advisors' SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT)** **is rebalancing on** **March 19th** **(**[**https://www.ft.com/content/3d9c8383-a083-44a3-9c7e-54bb36c95a51**](https://www.ft.com/content/3d9c8383-a083-44a3-9c7e-54bb36c95a51)**)**
* EDIT 03/13: 401k's are moving out of Melvin March 18th ([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3qvol/melvin\_capital\_potentially\_moving\_investors/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3qvol/melvin_capital_potentially_moving_investors/))

* 3. Ryan Cohen will become CEO at the end of march (probably march 25th)(theory)
* 4. Gamestop Shares callback early april (not confirmed yet!)
* 5. Maybe an emergency meeting, therefore another share callback (theory)
* **6. XRT Rebalance, they will probably throw out GME (theory, but that would force the shorts to cover all positions in XRT on that day)**
* 7. Like I stated in my first DDs, there are whales going for the really long play, therefore there is a lot of buying pressure from even more sides now, causing the price to keep spiking up, that's what we are seeing at the moment
* 8. Option chains get more massive by every week, more and more options become ITM and cause little gamma squeezes almost every few days, until a big one comes and the rocket lifts off
* 9. Gamestop will probably acquire SLG (Super League Gaming)

&#x200B;

TL;DR / TL;DW: We have around 12 - 15 catalysts for my predicted date. Making it almost impossible to weasle out and therefore making me more confident than ever in my theory.

&#x200B;

PS: To all the people saying I went off reddit but kept giving youtube interviews to make money or to attention whore, here is my response (copied from my own comment):  Hi. I just want to adress this, because I stumbled over that a lot today. I went on 2 Interviews (one was about 30 minutes long, the other one was about an hour long). Both of these interviews were SOLELY for answering questions regarding my DD. I don't want to plug anyones youtube stream. But I gave people 24hours to collect questions regarding my thoughts and they could ask me literally anything. I tried my best in that one hour interview and even doubled my time on that one (wanted to do 30 minutes initially). I only did the second interview because I felt like a lot of questions were asked within the first 24 hours and as I said, I wanted to answer as many as possible. I am in talk with one of the mods at the moment, because I want to adress the critique in a livestream or a youtube video. I am a slow and bad writer and can express my thoughts much quicker when I am talking. It's easier to add something to your thoughts and elaborate on some things further as well. So please. Give me around a week of a break and then I will answer every question in a stream or a video, that people want me to answer and those I am able to answer. If I am not able to answer a question, I am sorry, but I am not a messiah. I will add questions I am not able to answer to the stream or video as well. But as a PSA: Stop spreading fake information, that I went off reddit and went onto youtube to do a lot of videos or interviews. It was 1.5 hrs of answering questions surrounding the DD over the course of 2 days.

&#x200B;

Feel free to gather some questions and I will look forward to answering them! Thank you guys and gals for all the support, kind messages and what not. I appreciate all the support!

**DD Post:**

&#x200B;

I don’t even know how to start this. First of all, I want to add a really important disclaimer. The following DD presented is solely based on research, numbers and data available to the public. I tried to take every single factor out there into account. That doesn’t automatically mean, that all of the following has to become true. The following DD is what I THINK is going to happen. There is no guarantee and I am not taking any responsibility for any decisions people make after reading the DD. I let other people check my DD, double and triple read it myself, but there still might be some flaws in logic or errors. If you find any, CALL ME OUT on them! I will either correct or remove them, if there are any. As I said, multiple people proof read this, so there shouldn’t be any, but you never know. Now that we’ve got that sorted out, this is where the fun begins.

&#x200B;

Queue Avengers Endgame Theme:

&#x200B;

We have to start somewhere, so let’s start at some recent events. The first one: The crazy price run-up and the preparation of an options chain on February 24th. What exactly happened?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THE RABBIT HOLE PART I:**

To know what happened, it is really important to know, that Gamestop was on the short sale restriction (SSR) list that day. But how did GME get on the SSR in the first place? This is where it’s beginning to sound like a conspiracy theory or a fucking masterplan made up by other hedge funds in order to bait out Citadel/Melvin.

&#x200B;

**Let’s take a look at the Data:**

On February 23rd GME opened at $44.97. Within the first few seconds GME reached its Day High of $46,23. GME also reached its Day Low at 9:50AM. So within 20 minutes after the market opened, GME reached its high and its low for the whole day!

https://preview.redd.it/4ivzo181b6l61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e32ed1a1fbfd4eb0851b0a82559791ee30eace3

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fiseko03b6l61.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=6368f68c4fbb1bf1f3083c4e62fbf507be49865d

&#x200B;

Nothing special, right? Wrong. The price drop to exactly $40 was created artificially by someone shorting 100,000 shares right at opening.

https://preview.redd.it/b09chl44b6l61.png?width=322&format=png&auto=webp&s=6481a4abd3c5e1fae70a27f18faacc8e6c3ea0e2

In addition to that, they set off a calculated sell and then closed their short position instantly after hitting the $40 mark. Buying back the shares to cover their position in addition to buying back in (propably by the same institution that shorted and sold off a couple of shares to drive the price down to $40) brought the price back to exactly $44,97 for a second. Notice anything? That is EXACTLY the opening price. So after that 35 minute span of shenanigans we were right back to the opening price and it was like nothing happened to the stock.

&#x200B;

But something did happen. Something really important. That quick sell-off and shorting brought the price down by 10 %. That got GME on the SSR for the next day.

https://preview.redd.it/fn8lz4c5b6l61.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=d78facf6d699d1a21a50ef162fe5d47a2aba584f

&#x200B;

Conclusion: Someone got the price down by 10 % within a couple of minutes but the same someone got it instantly back up after that, making it seem, that their solely goal was to get GME on the SSR for the next day while trying to avoid a panic sell off by dropping the price too low. And that is really important now!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THE RABBIT HOLE PART II:**

As I stated in my post on February 24th, I found out, that someone with large amounts of money set up the GME Stock for a Gamma Squeeze. How you may ask? I am gonna quote my own post here, so I don’t have to repeat myself:

\-----------------------------------------------

MY POST FROM 24THFEB:

So, we have a few hints that institutions jumped in for some fun.

• There are lot of buy orders with 3 to 4 decimals being made, driving the price up bit by bit. That kind of trading is not possible for retail. ([https://imgur.com/a/26y2B8Z](https://imgur.com/a/26y2B8Z))

• Someone prepared Call-Chains to set up GME for a Gamma Squeeze, possibly starting the short squeeze ([https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME)) (Also:[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lq5tnh/gme\_a\_whale\_is\_setting\_up\_a\_gamma\_squeeze\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lq5tnh/gme_a_whale_is_setting_up_a_gamma_squeeze_this/))

• Hedgies shorted GME with 200,000 Shares. That didn't get the price back down to <$50. So what did they do? They shorted it again with 100,000 Shares. That eventually dropped the price to <$50 again. ([https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) EDIT: They just shorted another 100,000! That makes 400,000 shares sold short today.

&#x200B;

**EDIT: ANOTHER FIND: Because GME is on the SSR today, they are not allowed to short on downticks. When GME hit it's 2nd low after reaching the $50 mark, someone shorted XRT with 100,000 shares on a downtick, thus working around the SSR and trying to destroy upward momentum again:** [**https://iborrowdesk.com/report/XRT**](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/XRT)**. Spoiler: It didn't work.**

&#x200B;

**Guess which price would start the call chain? Correct: $50**. So, Citadel and Friends and Institutions are battling around the $50 mark right now. Citadel and Friends don't want a gamma squeeze to take place again, so they keep shorting to keep it under $50. And someone with shitloads of money keeps buying and trying to drive the price above $50 before close, so the call chain starts rolling.

&#x200B;

What supports me in my theory is: After the price dropped <$50, there was a battle around the $50 for quite some time, after that, the price has been going sideways for hours. Both sides are probably waiting for the other side to do something, in order to counter that with either more shorts, or a sudden jump in buy-volume. That's why no one is doing anything right now, because only the closing price and that we stay around $50 till then in order to close above $50 counts.

&#x200B;

**EDIT: ANOTHER HINT TO FURTHER SUPPORT MY THEORY**: The $50 mark battle had insane volume. After HF shorted GME twice and UI battled around that price, the volume died down to 10 - 20 % of what it was around that mark ([https://imgur.com/a/s5lY3Hr](https://imgur.com/a/s5lY3Hr)). For me it looks like they just tested each other to see how far the other party will go in order to reach their goal and are now waiting for what I wrote above.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Hedgies vs. unknown Institutions (UI). UI set everything up for a gamma squeeze and need the price to close above $50. HF know and don't want that to happen and keep shorting the shit out of GME to keep it below $50. Both sides waiting for the other one to do something. Battle will start shortly before the market closes. Just a theory, no advice, ape hoping for banana 🍌💎🤲

&#x200B;

**PSA: GME IS RESTRICTED FROM SHORTING ONLY ON DOWNTICKS! THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SHORT ON UPTICKS. (Short Sale Restriction List:** [ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers\_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers\_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210223.xls](https://ftp.nyxdata.com/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_2021/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers_202102/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210223.xls)) Thanks to [u/ HYPERLINK ""https://www.reddit.com/u/designerinsider/""designerinsider](https://www.reddit.com/u/designerinsider/) for providing the list!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: **IT DOES NOT MATTER FOR US IF WE CLOSE ABOVE OR BELOW $50!** Just wanted to clarify. If we close above $50, that would be a huge win and an almost certain catalyst for a Gamma Squeeze, if they exercise their options. But what if we close below $50? Nothing changes. Diamonds Hands are really important atm and it's only a matter of time until that bubble pops.

&#x200B;

EDIT2: FURTHER HINT SUPPORTING MY THEORY: **THEY JUST BORROWED 1,000,000 (YES, 1 MILLION!) ADDITIONAL SHARES TO SHORT. THEY ARE PREPARING!**

&#x200B;

EDIT4: Seems like Institutions are baiting out the Hedgies right now, we broke $50 again! BUT BE CAREFUL! Hedgies borrowed 1,000,000 Shares in order to short the stock again and again. Our allies are propably trying to bait out those borrowed shares at the moment and the price will dip a few times and have huge volatility. If we don't have any huge dips today, that means the Hedgies didn't short their borrowed shares yet. Keep that in mind for the following days! They might accept their fate today and let it close above $50, but try to interrupt the upward momentum when those Calls become ITM and get exercised.

&#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion: An Institution (probably another hedge fund) set up an options chain ranging from $50 into the high hundreds. Well knowing that it will work, because Gamestop was only allowed to be shorted on upticks, because it was on the SSR that day! Why was it on the SSR? The same someone made sure it got there the day before. Because people were not selling GME and the volume was really low until then, they prepared to buy in shortly before the market closed, because it was easier to reach their price target with less capital when the volume is as low as it was that day. Citadel and Friends didn’t even try to fight back that evening. They probably knew who was behind it and knew what kind of money they are fighting against (Remember that battle mid-day at the $50 mark). They tested each other at that moment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THE RABBIT HOLE PART III:**

Okay, now we know that someone planned all this over the span of a week and the plan was executed perfectly working in, whoever planned its, favor. But why is someone planning all this and spending that much money on a gamma squeeze and then just forgets about it and doesn’t care what the price is the days after? Because now we get to the real shit that sounds like something out of a conspiracy or movie. Spoiler: Whoever set up the Gamma Squeeze set it up as a bait for Citadel and never cared about it actually happening or not. They just wanted it to make it look like they want a Gamma Squeeze to happen. Here is why:

On the 26th of February I posted an important post regarding the illegal naked shorting with counterfeit shares. Here is a link to the post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsvl8k/really\_long\_dd\_and\_analysis\_what\_happened/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsvl8k/really_long_dd_and_analysis_what_happened/)

&#x200B;

On February 25th, there was a short volume of AT LEAST 33,000,000 to 51,000,000 Shares (highest report). Those were naked shorts being done with counterfeit shares. Brief explanation: **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. **This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules**. **The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud**.

&#x200B;

**Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.**

&#x200B;

So, naked shorting is not always illegal. **It is legal IF the market makers are able to deliver the shorted shares within a given time period.** And now it gets really juicy.

&#x200B;

**Fails–to–Deliver** — The process of creating shares via naked shorting creates an obvious imbalance in the market as the sell side is artificially increased with naked short shares or more accurately, counterfeit shares. Time limits are imposed that dictate how long the sold share can be naked. For a stock market investor or trader, that time limit is three days. According to SEC rules, if the broker dealer has not located a share to borrow, they are supposed to take cash in the short account and purchase a share in the open market. This is called a “buy–in,” and it is supposed to maintain the total number of shares in the market place equal to the number of shares the company has issued.

&#x200B;

So, what we now know is, there was huge short volume on the 25th February, the biggest in the history of GME (let’s take the middle of the lowest and the highest report and we have a short volume of 42,000,000). Why? In order to stop the Gamma Rocket from lifting off and delaying the real short squeeze. Citadel and Friends naked shorted GME with about 33,000,000 to 51,000,000 shares that don’t exist, additional to the already existing short positions they have.

&#x200B;

**IN SHORT**: Whoever planned all that knew, that Citadel and Friends were going to MASSIVELY overshort GME and it was prepared and planned to happen on that exact day. Whoever planned it, trapped Citadel and Friends into a corner of poor despair and desperation. But why on THAT EXACT DATE you may ask yourself now?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THE RABBIT HOLE PART IV:**

Let’s get to the final and REALLY REALLY REALLY juicy stuff. Why was all this important? Why the bait setup? Why at that exact date? And to which date is everything pointing to?

&#x200B;

What else do we need to know before we get to the juicy stuff? There are about 63 ETFs containing GME, that are massively shorted as well as the underlying GME stock itself. We only need to know about the one ETF that has almost 10 % of their Portfolio being GME for this. The biggest one there is: XRT. Why is XRT so interesting?

&#x200B;

As of 25th of February XRT GME holdings increased from 3% yesterday to 10% today. ([https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/))

&#x200B;

As of 26th of February, XRT is also the MOST HEAVILY SHORTED ETF IN THE WORLD with almost 200 % of their shares being sold short. ([https://www.etfchannel.com/type/most-shorted-etfs/](https://www.etfchannel.com/type/most-shorted-etfs/))

&#x200B;

**What does this tell us? XRT is the prime ETF used by Citadel and Friends to hide their real short positions from the public.**

&#x200B;

**So, when is it going to happen? AT AROUND(!)FRIDAY, MARCH 19th 2021. Evidence to support that date and everything coming together:**

&#x200B;

First, we have to take a look at the basis of the current situation.

&#x200B;

AS OF THE 23RD OF FEBRUARY, THE SHORT INTEREST WAS CALCULATED TO BE AT LEAST 430 %. THAT NUMBER BECOMES MUCH MUCH HIGHER IF WE TAKE THE SHORT ACTIVITY FROM 25TH AND 24TH INTO ACCOUNT!

&#x200B;

23rdFeb Calculation:

Insider Ownership: 23,704,787

Institutions: 151,000,000

Funds: 40,000,000

Retail: 38,595,000

Total Owned: 253,299,787

Total Outstanding: 69,746,960

Percentage of ownership to outstanding: 363.17%

Estimated Synthetic Shares: 183,552,827

FINRA Short % of Float: 78.46%

Finviz Float: 50,650,000

Reported Shares Shorted: 35,538,624

Total Estimated Short (Synthetic + Reported)

219,091,451

**Percentage of Shorts to the Float: 432.56%**

&#x200B;

**Evidence to support March 19th 2021:**

&#x200B;

**1. AI Prediction starts around that Date:**

https://preview.redd.it/g5wh5zxsb6l61.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=596a22807faccea6f6fa96b6d1d1f96f385eefdb

&#x200B;

**2**. Remember the naked short activity on 24th and 25thFeb? Now It is really important to look at the date, when the biggest naked short activity happened and why it was so important to look at what naked shorting is and what the result of naked shorting is. Remember! Market makers have a special exemption that gives them 21 days to purchase actual shares after naked shorting. That's 33 – 51 million more purchases by? You guessed it. **Friday March 19th** from 25th February’s naked shorting alone and 12 million from 24th to be purchased one day prior.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**3. March 19th is XRT rebalance day.** XRT releases dividends every 3 months. Last one was December 21st,2020. Estimated next payout is around March 20th. By this time the shorts NEED to cover their GME shorts through XRT. ([https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/xrt/dividend-history](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/funds-and-etfs/xrt/dividend-history)) (Answered that in my Interview that I linked above, there is much more behind this and I explained it there!)

https://preview.redd.it/1qpqbxkxb6l61.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd313c3f87eea55a679232492a3ecaa860a828f2

&#x200B;

**4**. Massive option chains set up for 3/19 with volume so big, that only large Institutions who know what’s coming set it up.

&#x200B;

As of the 26thFEB, XRT has 18,000 volume on 80$ Puts for 3/19. For comparison: The volume for 3/26 80$ puts is 142.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XRT/options?date=1616112000&p=XRT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XRT/options?date=1616112000&p=XRT)

&#x200B;

XRT Puts for 3/19:

• 5,558 @ $45

• 14,394 @ $50

• 7,633 @ $55

• 29,787 @ $60

• 14,138 @ $65

• 32,919 @ $70

• 8,063 @ $75

• 17,853 @ $80

&#x200B;

**Further comparisons**:

XRT Puts for 2/26: 2314 Puts at any strike on the chain combined.

XRT Puts for 3/5: 2139 Puts at any strike on the chain combined.

Market makers are hedging what they own with puts to save the value of their shares they currently own in case the market implodes. I'm marking my calendar... 3/19/21 is lining up perfectly to be the day the shit truly hits the fan for the market.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**5.** **Quadruple Witching Day.**

What Is Quadruple Witching? ([https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quadruplewitching.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quadruplewitching.asp))

Quadruple witching refers to a date on which stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously.

While stock options contracts and index options expire on the third Friday of every month, all four asset classes expire simultaneously **on the third Friday of March** (Which day was it again were talking about? Oh, right, Friday March 19th, the third Friday of the month), June, September, and December\*\*. Quadruple witching days witness heavy trading volume, in part, due to the offsetting of existing futures and options contracts that are profitable.\*\*

Quadruple witching is similar to the triple witching dates, when three out of the four markets expire at the same time, or double witching, when two markets out of the four markets expire at the same time. *You should expect all kinds of fuckery on a quad witching date. GME mooning and crashing the rest of the market would certainly be appropriate for a quad witching date*. (Quoting u/ [Scfi4444](https://www.reddit.com/user/Scfi4444/))

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**6**. **Gamestop Q4 Earnings are released** **~~4~~** **(EDIT 03/14. Apparently the date moved up to 03/23, so it's 2 Business Days) Business Days after March 19th**, that’ll be another catalyst to keep the flame going for a few days. Because Q4 is the the quarter, where retail makes their most revenue. [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/earnings#:\~:text=Earnings%20announcement\*%20for%20GME%3A%20Mar%2025%2C%202021 HYPERLINK ""https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/earnings""& HYPERLINK ""https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/earnings""text=According%20to%20Zacks%20Investment%20Research,quarter%20last%20year%20was%20%241.27](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/earnings).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**7.** Market makers were so sure of GameStop’s bankruptcy, that they wrote lots of naked call options. A call option is a contract with the OPTION to buy a stock at a certain price in the future. Call options cost money (a premium) and they're pretty cheap. The contract specifies a strike price (at what stock price can you execute the contract) and is always higher than the current stock price.

Because of the massive violence inflicted on GME stock with the shorting, the sellers of the contracts were also sure that contracts with strike prices higher than let's say $20 COULD never be executed. They became greedy and reckless and decided to sell more contracts than they actually owned stock. In fact, they sold MILLIONS OF SHARES WORTH of contracts for which they don't and didn’t own stock.

This means that the buyer of the contract is able to request the stock for that contract from the seller. If you never had the stock to begin with, THATS A PROBLEM. If you sold this contract naked, now you have to go in the market to buy it AT ANY PRICE or risk massive fines and sanctions.

**And at what day does the shit hit the fan again? Oh, right, a Friday. But not any day. It’s Friday, March 19th 2021.**

&#x200B;

**MY Conclusion**: The squeeze is inevitable. It got delayed many times, but no matter what data you look at, the outcome is always the same, everything points to this specific date. Also: Other Hedge funds smell blood. They can take out some of their biggest competitors as well as making billions and billions of dollars in the process. There couldn’t be a bigger win win situation for them, than this one. I think the squeeze is starting a few days, maybe even a week prior to March 19th. I think that it’ll start March 15th and build up all the way to March 19th, where the real rocket takes off. How long is it going to last? I don’t know, no one does. But I think it’s going to last for at least one week. Of course, it’s going to get more and more expensive to buy in over time, so you don’t want to miss out. As always: Buy and Hodl.

pixel out.

We know they lost.

They know they lost.

Vast majority of this sub are probably balls deep in GME at this point. There's a ton of DD to confidently invest in the stock, but what does it matter if one has already bought all the shares they are capable of.

With all the evidence pointing to an inevitable squeeze I'm confident that they're afraid that it gets out. Right now everyone and their mother has probably heard of GME but all they hear is the bullshit from MSM. Now image if users of r/all were daily exposed to GME posts with headlines such as these. 

(Just copied a couple random ones from the past week)

*  **This week, and why I am at $2,000,000 minimum. (Now $3mil)** 
*   **My Dad who was vehemently anti-GME in January bought his first share today!! The doubters are starting to believe!!! 💎🙌📈🚀** 
*  **🚀Get Ready For The Biggest Short Squeeze Of Your Lifetime🚀** 
*  **🚨IMPORTANT🚨 ALL apes need to read this to prepare for squeeze, or risk potentially losing profit!** 

At some point you'd have to check out what the fuck was going on with r/GME and slowly more and more people would understand. More people understanding means more upvotes, means spreading fastere, means more shares for retail untill they can't contain the buying power anymore and it moons.

This would also explain the mass reports of the famous apes among us. Those would be the people most likely to push us to the front page because they consistently get upvotes at a rate that almost ensures their posts going viral and hitting r/all.

Welp... Not like it matters. They're just buying more time for their bonuses to go through.

Under almost every post and comment section I go to, there are brand new accounts with negative Karma talking about how I shouldn't be trusted, because my 99 % prediction didn't become true, or that I am a quote ""agent saboteur"" (best one yet lol.)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/22hzy3r8gjo61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=917e2b16877397825b9ed8fa847f2bf729b41194

&#x200B;

That's the kind of comments under every single post and comment at the moment. NOT EVERYONE OF THEM IS A PAID SHILL. Some of them are legit retarded and altough I retracted the 99 % bullshit immediatly after posting, talked about it in 3 interviews in 4 livestreams, comments, posts, Twitter and in the Endgame DD, they seem to have never received the message.

&#x200B;

I. **Why now?**

This started immediately after I was unbanned. Why was that? Hedgies are scared, because March 19th was probably a date, where shit was destined to go down. They overshorted themselves, borrowing almost every single share in existence on March 19th and most of the effects are to be seen this week (ETF rebalances and Quad Witching). Warden and I were banned that day, my account kept getting mass reported after my unban and now there is a shilling campaign about how I shouldn't be trusted anymore, because I am a saboteur or a shill myself.

&#x200B;

II. **Why are they doing it?**

They are scared that I and other researchers (like rensole, warden, iamnotafinancialadvisor) will find out and share new timespans, dates or set events, where shit could go down. Therefore they will try to discredit us (me specifically, because I was an easy target with the post), so no one will listen to us, we don't have a big voices in the sub anymore and we all get seperated and only follow the people and posts we trust/like. If they are able to destroy the trust in people, they won't be followed and listened to anymore, no matter how fundamental their research is.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** FUD and shilling campaign is entering the next stage. Keep an eye out for people calling researchers saboteurs, shills and they shouldn't be trusted. Look at their accounts. Every single account i checked was brand new, revived (years old but started posting again) or simply never posted in stock-related subs and starts spamming them now.

&#x200B;

Edit: I just read about all the messages people have been receiving from bots and shills. Seems like they entered the final stage.

***A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.***

Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. **To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market**, **investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.** Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing.

Everything disclosed in the post was done by myself, with public information. I came to my own conclusions, as should you.

**TL;DR - Citadel Securities has been fined 58 times for violating FINRA, REGSHO & SEC regulations. Several instances are documented as 'willful' naked shorting. In Dec 2020 they reported an increase in their short position of 127.57% YOY, and I'm calling bullsh\*t on their shenanigans.**

I've been digging into the financial statements of Citadel Securities between 2018 and 2020. Primarily because Citadel Securities *actually* has a set of published financial statements as opposed to the 13Fs filed by Citadel Advisors.

First... Citadel is a conglomerate.. they have a hand in literally every pocket of the financial world. Citadel Advisors LLC is managing $384,926,232,238 in market securities as of December 2020...

Yes, seriously- **$384,926,232,238**

$295,347,948,000 of that is split into options (calls & puts), while $78,979,887,238 *(****20.52%****)* is allocated to actual, *physical*, shares (or so they say). The rest is convertible debt securities.

The value of those options can change dramatically in a short amount of time, so Citadel invests in several ""trading practices"" which allow them to stay ahead of the average 'Fidelity Active Trader Pro'. Robinhood actually sells this data (option price, expiration date, ticker symbol, everything) to Citadel from it's users. Those commission fees you're not paying for? yeah.... think again..  Check out [Robinhoods 606 Form](https://cdn.robinhood.com/assets/robinhood/legal/RHS%20SEC%20Rule%20606a%20and%20607%20Disclosure%20Report%20Q4%202020.pdf) to see how much Citadel paid them in Q4 2020.. F\*CK Robhinhood.

Anyway, another example is Citadel's high-frequency trading. They actually profit *between* the national ask-bid prices and scrape pennies off millions of transactions... I'm going to show you  several instances where Citadel received a 'slap on the wrist' from FINRA for doing this, but not just yet.

Now.... the *""totally, 100% legit, nothing-to-see-here,* *independent*\*""\* branch of Citadel Advisors is Citadel Securities- the Market Maker Making Manipulated Markets. The whole purpose of the DTCC is to serve as an third party between brokers and customers (check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtkaMx12otQ) for more on DTCC corruption). I'll bring up the DTCC again, soon.

Anyway, Citadel Advisors uses their own subsidiary (Citadel Securities) to support their very ""unique"" style of trading. For some reason, the SEC and FINRA have allowed this, but not without citing **them for 58 'REGULATORY EVENTS'**.

So that got me thinking.... ""WTF is Citadel actually putting out there for the public to see?"" Truthfully, not much... a 12-page annual report called a 'statement of financial condition'.

&#x200B;

Statement of Financial Condition in 2018.

The highlighted section above represents ***securities sold, but not yet purchased, at fair value*** for $22,357,000,000. This is a liability because Citadel is responsible for paying back the securities they borrowed and sold. If you're thinking *""that sounds a lot like a short"",* you're correct. Citadel Securities shorted $22 big ones (that's billion) in 2018.

2020 starts to get REALLY interesting...

Throughout the COVID pandemic, we all heard the stories of brick-and-mortars going bankrupt. It was becoming *VERY* profitable to bet against the continuity of these companies, so big f\*cks like Citadel decided to up their portfolio... by **127.57%**.

https://preview.redd.it/83uepbgudqm61.png?width=829&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c8b1f1475be0cf61d55f87e29fd282c45833b3c

That's right. Citadel Securities upped their short position to **$57,506,000,000** in 2020.

We've all heard Jimmy Cramer's bedtime stories: *""It's important to create a narrative in your favor so that your short position helps drive those businesses into bankruptcy.""* Personally, I'm convinced that most of the media hype throughout COVID was an example of this, but I digress.

[Out of the $32,236,000,000 increase in shorts during 2020,  $22,740,000,000 \(70.5&#37;\) were increases in financial derivatives \(options\)... ](https://preview.redd.it/nwght79ayvm61.png?width=870&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bad63929dbaf3449cde0784fce8f98657cd9a32)

Anyway, Citadel shorted another $32,236,000,000 in 2020 and rolled into 2021 with some PHAT $TACK$. Now it's time for a quick accounting lesson; this is where you're going to sh\*ted the bed.

You see the highlighted section below? Citadel (and other companies reporting highly liquid securities) uses 'Fair Value' accounting to measure the amount that goes on their balance sheet (including liabilities like short positions). The cash that Citadel received (asset) was accounted for when the security was sold, but the liability (short) needs to be recorded at the CURRENT MARKET PRICE for those securities while they remain on the balance sheet..

https://preview.redd.it/sxznlzxw3tm61.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=3943060b3844675b5cc8b165a5371a37bb0f6809

At the end of 2020, the 'Fair Value' of their short positions were $57 billion.

At the end of 2021, however, Citadel will need to adjust the value of those liabilities to their CURRENT market value... Since we don't know the domestic allocation of their short portfolio, you can only imagine the sh\*tsunami that's coming for them..

Take $GME for example....

We [KNOW](https://wallstreetonparade.com/2021/02/citadel-didnt-just-bail-out-a-gamestop-short-seller-citadel-also-had-a-big-short-position-in-gamestop/) that Citadel ""had"" a short position in $GME along with Melvin Capital... Can you imagine the damage that r/wallstreetbets has done to the other stonks in their portfolio? If Melvin lost 53% in January from this, there's no telling what the current 'Fair Value' of those shorts are..

**I trust a wet fart more than Citadel, Melvin, and Point 72.** [Here's why](https://files.brokercheck.finra.org/firm/firm_116797.pdf).

This is a FINRA report published in early 2021. It cites 58 regulatory violations and 1 arbitration. After explaining how Ken Griffin basically controls the world through the tentacles of the Citadel octopus, it lists detailed cases and fines that were usually *'neither admitted or denied, but promptly paid'* by Citadel Securities.

Let me shed some light on a *FEW*:

1. INACCURATE REPORTING OF SHORT SALE INDICATOR. FIRM ALSO FAILED TO HAVE A SUPERVISORY SYSTEM IN PLACE TO COMPLY WITH FINRA RULES REQUIRING USE OF SHORT SALE INDICATORS. **DATE INITIATED 11/13/2020 - $180,000 FINE**
2. TRADING AHEAD OF ACTIVE CUSTOMER ORDERS... IMPLEMENTED CONTROLS  THAT REMOVED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF MOSTLY-LARGER CUSTOMER ORDERS FROM TRADING SYSTEM LOGICS...  INTENTIONALLY CREATING DELAYS BETWEEN MARKET MAKERS' TRANSACTIONS WHILE THE UNRESPONSIVE PARTY UPDATED PRICE QUOTES.... NO SUPERVISORY SYSTEM IN PLACE TO PREVENT THIS. **DATE INITIATED 7/16/2020 - $700,000 FINE**
3. FAILED TO CLOSE OUT A FAILURE TO DELIVER POSITION; EFFECTED SHORT SALES. **DATE INITIATED 2/14/2020 - $10,000 FINE**
4. BETWEEN JUNE 12, 2013 - OCTOBER 17 2017 (**YEAH, OVER 4 YEARS**) THE FIRM PRINCIPALLY EXECUTED BETWEEN 248 AND 7,698 BUY ORDERS DURING A CIRCUIT BREAKER EVENT; FAILED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. **INITIATED 1/22/2020 - $15,000 FINE**
5. ON OR ABOUT 11/16/2017, CITADEL SECURITIES TENDERED 34,299 SHARES IN EXCESS OF IT'S NET LONG POSITION (naked short); **DATE INITIATED 8/21/2019 - $30,000 FINE**
6. CEASE AND DESIST ORDER ON 12/10/2018: FAILURE TO SUBMIT COMPLETE AND ACCURATE DATA TO COMMISSION BLUESHEET (""EBS"") REQUESTS. (BASICALLY FAILED TO PROVIDE PROOF OF TRANSACTIONS TO THE SEC). BETWEEN NOV 2012 AND AUG 2016, CITADEL SECURITIES PROVIDED 2,774 EBS STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CONTAINED DEFICIENT INFORMATION RESULTING IN INCORRECT TRADE EXECUTION TIME DATA ON 80 MILLION TRADES. **DATE INITIATED 12/10/2018 - $3,500,000 FINE**
7. TENDERED SHARES FOR THE PARTIAL TENDER OFFER IN EXCESS OF ITS NET LONG POSITION (more naked shorting); FAILED TO ESTABLISH SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES. **INITIATED 3/22/2018 - $35,000 FINE**
8. IN MORE THAN 200,000 INSTANCES BETWEEN JULY 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 2016, FIRM FAILED TO EXECUTE AND MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS, TWO-SIDED TRADING INTEREST WITHIN THE DESIGNATED PERCENTAGE (scraping pennies between bid-ask) ABOVE AND BELOW THE NATIONAL BEST BID OFFER.... **INITIATED 10/13/2017 - $80,000 FINE**
9. ANOTHER CEASE AND DESIST FOR  MAJOR MARKET MANIPULATION BETWEEN 2007 - 2010. **INITIATED 1/13/2017 - $22,668,268 FINE**

Quite frankly, I'm tired of typing them. There are **STILL 49** violations, and most are BIG fines.

Naked shorts, failure to provide documentation to SEC, short selling on trade halts..... is this starting to sound familiar? When r/wallstreetbets started exposing the truth, they lost the advantage. Now that the DD is coming out about this sh\*t, they're getting desperate.

Let's look at some recent events that occurred with trading halts in $GME. On March 10 2021 (Mar10 Day) we watched the stock rise until 12:30pm when an *unbelievable* drop triggered at least 4 circuit breaker events (probably more but I walked away for a bit).

[Price drop of 40&#37; in about 25 minutes](https://preview.redd.it/00b5hrc96tm61.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac4247e1bf857c4e94d0479b5fe32a8b49c9799a)

Now... I do not believe retail traders did this.. most importantly, the market was totally frozen for the majority of that 25 minutes. Even if people were putting in orders to sell, there were just as many people trying to buy the dip.

The volume of shares flooding the market- at the same exact time- was premeditated. I can say that with confidence because several media outlets (mainly MarketWatch) published articles WHILE this was happening, after nearly a week of radio-silence. MarketWatch even predicted the decline of 40% before the entire drop had occurred. When Redditors reached out to ask WTF was going on, the authors set their Twitter accounts to private... slimy. as. f\*ck.

""But wait.... didn't example # 4 say that Citadel was fined $15,000 for selling shorts during circuit breaker events!?""

Yup! and here are **TWO** more instances:

1. **CITADEL SECURITIES LLC EFFECTED TRANSACTIONS DURING NUMEROUS TRADING HALTS..**

I can't tell who was responsible for the flash crash in $GME last Wednesday; I don't think anyone can. However, to suggest that it wasn't market manipulation is laughable. The media and hedge funds are tighter than your wife and her boyfriend, so spending time on this issue is a waste.

But what we can do is look at the steps they're taking to prepare for this sh\*tsunami. So let's summarize everything up to this point, shall we?

1. Citadel has been cited for 58 separate incidents, several of which were for naked shorting and circuit breaker flash-crashes
2. The short shares reported on Citadel's balance sheet as of December 2020 were up **127% YOY**
3. The price of several heavily-shorted stocks has skyrocketed since Jan 2021
4. Citadel uses 'Fair Value' accounting and needs to reconcile the value of their short positions to this new market price. The higher the price goes, the more expensive it becomes for them to HODL

We know that Citadel is on the hook for $57,000,000,000 in shorts, but at least they're HODLing onto some physical shares as assets, right?.... RIGHT??

This should soothe that smooth ape brain of yours...

""UHHHHHH ACTUALLY, THE DTCC & FRIENDS OWN OUR PHYSICAL SHARES"".....

Well that's just terrific, because the DTCC just implemented [SRCC 801](https://www.dtcc.com/Globals/PDFs/2021/March/05/SR-NSCC-2021-801) which means they **DON'T** have your f\*cking shares... I've seriously never seen so much finger pointing and ass-covering in my LIFE....

I know this post was long, but the story can't go untold.

The pressure being placed on hedge funds to deliver has never been higher and the sh\*t storm of corruption is coming to a head. Unfortunately, the dirty tricks & FUD will continue until this boil ruptures. There are several catalysts coming up, but no one truly knows when the MOAB will blow.

# TL;DR:

Today (MAR31), $52.94million was “spent” simultaneously on deep in the money call options for GME, ranging from 3C to 19C. None of the previous days show such activity, but we have seen this stuff in the past already. Today, I tried to size the rabbit hole.

Back in February, a number of apes identified weird transactions taking place in deep-in-the-money calls, mainly at $12 and $15 strikes. First people thought it was some kind of oddball bullish play, but it soon transpired that these never appear in the Open Interest, they are seemingly immediately exercised:

[^(https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m05jed/mystery\_solved\_the\_deep\_itm\_calls\_are\_coming\_from/)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m05jed/mystery_solved_the_deep_itm_calls_are_coming_from/)

Why would somebody do that? Apparently, to reset the clock on their FTDs.

# This SEC paper discusses the mechanism of this practice: [https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf)

For the length of this piece, let's call them 'deep ITM call anomalies'.

Today, this activity is back.

I used these clues to trace back days with a lot of activity in these particular options, which then led me to find more call option types being used for the same practice.

# In one evening, I identified approx. 30 call option strikes and expiries that have been used for this practice since January 1, and I believe I have traced where approximately 44 million missing GME shares have been hidden (cumulatively). I prove that they are not organic activity by identifying their hallmarks, and that this practice is taking place cyclically.

So following the two favorites, APR16 12c and 15c, there were clear patterns that would jump out at anyone. They were abused heavily in the last week of Feb / first week of March:

Some of the ones I have identified above might be missing from the final cut, if I found something that pointed to organic volume or another confounding variable.

# SUPERIMPOSE!

[ Huge drop in reported short interest correlates with huge volume of 'deep ITM call anomalies' in January. As soon as the 'anomalies' disappear, publicly announced short volume stabilizes. Little blips of 'anomalies' correlate to small drops in SI. The reappearance of anomalies from Feb25 correlates with SI 'decreasing'. ](https://preview.redd.it/30cu5hgl9kq61.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=87a01c600fa76a2737bb50c84d9bb52d2bade2f3)

I believe we can also see a correlation with the price.

This can be for one of two reasons:

1. The shorts are buying what they can on the open market to close some positions during these times, and resetting the FTD clock on the remainder with this practice.
2. The rising price puts their position at more risk and they scramble to reset the FTDs.

# This seems pretty simple?

I agree. This is out in the open, basically. I mean, I found it the moment I decided to find it. This is why I would lean towards 2) The rising price puts their short position in more risk and they scramble to reset the FTDs.

1. **13th of January - aka 'The Day when people realised DFV might be right'** \- Open 20.42, High 38.65, Close 31.40 - the price doubles after 13 days of staying around the $20 level - 1.6m FTDs are reset that day with this activity.
2. **22nd January -** Open 42.59, High 76.76, Close 65.01. 2.9m FTD are reset that day, and 3m a day are reset until Jan 27.
3. **January 27 -** The day it really squoze (for now) - after closing at 147.98 the night before, GME opened at 354.83, reached a high of 380, and closed at 347.51. Immediately, 6.3m FTDs are reset that day, 4.68m the next day, and 3.5m+ a day for the two days thereafter.
4. As soon as the price is contained at around $50, this activity stops.
5. **February 24th - aka The Day We Understood We Aren't Crazy -** Open 44.70, Rally starting at 3:15pm to Close 91.71, Highs of 200 in Aftermarket.
6. **Feb 25 opens at 169.56. Deep ITM anomalies resume**, with 800k FTDs reset FEB25, 26, and 27th. Altogether, 7.15m FTDs would be reset until March 11th.

From this, I would lean towards the hypothesis that resetting FTDs with deep ITM calls is a knee-jerk reaction - the simplest, most stupidly obvious and lazy method of doing it, and they are perhaps doing it when caught off guard, or when there is no better solution.

**I might be wrong with my thinking here and I invite you to think about how I could be wrong here and improve our shared understanding.**

# What are the hallmarks of this activity

1. Stable Open Interest
2. 2x-20x Multiples of the open interest traded a day for 9-11 days, then back to normal, almost zero volume.
3. Blocks of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, even up to 2000 on the day of The Minor Squozening (JAN27)
4. VAST Majority from the PHLX exchange.

# Is this the full picture?

No. This has been happening with many more call options. For many of those, there would be what I could identify as significant organic volume, but still peppered with blocks of 100 and 200 from PHLX. There are some where just blocks of 20-40 were used. I did not investigate fully the expiries that were being used prior to January 22. I could not risk skewing the conservative estimation.

All of the above data is based on the strikes and expiries that were popular with the hedgies in February and early March:

**FEB19 $5c FEB19 $15c FEB19 $16c FEB19 $20c MAR19 $20c MAR19 $30c APR16 $4.5C APR16 $5C APR 16 $7C APR 16 $10C APR16 $12C APR16 $13C APR16 $14C APR16 $15C APR16 $16C APR16 $17C APR16 $18C APR16 $19C APR16 $5C JUL16 $5C JUL16 $6C JUL16 $7C JUL16 $10C JUL16 $12C NOV21 $3C NOV21 $5C JAN 2022 $1C JAN 2022 $4.5C JAN 2022 $5C JAN 2022 $7C JAN 2022 $10C JAN 2022 $12C JAN 2022 $15C JAN 2023 $7C**

# Does the SEC know?

**Of course.**

Here is a quote from their 2013 paper:

>The Second Transaction to “Reset the Clock”  
>  
>Assuming that XYZ is a hard to borrow security, and that Trader A, or its broker-dealer, is unable (or unwilling) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A’s clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer’s close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of  short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as “reset transactions,” in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. The buy-writes may be (but are not always) prearranged trades between market makers or parties claiming to be market makers. The price in these transactions is determined so that the short seller pays a small price to the other market-maker for the trade, resulting in no economic benefit to the short seller for the reset transaction other than to give the appearance of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases.30 Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm’s responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.

EDIT4: Someone stole my post on WSB and isn't even crediting me. I DON'T MIND CROSSPOSTS, THEY HELP EVERYONE AND BRING EXPOSURE TO THE ISSUE. BUT DON'T STEAL AND NOT CREDIT ME! Just wanted to vent because it's actually blowing up on WSB, but he isn't even updating the data, so it's pretty useless.

IMPORTANT EDIT(5)(10:41AM):  CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ROSE 10 % AND THE WHOLE MARKET IS TAKING DIPS RIGHT NOW. That's exactly what happened back in January in the first Gamma Squeeze. Good sign!

EDIT6:  **XRT GME holdings increased from 3% testerday to 9% today. XRT IS ALMOST 200 % SHORT SOLD ATM** ([https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/xrt/))

EDIT7(12:21AM): CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ROSE 16 % AND THE WHOLE MARKET IS TAKING DIPS RIGHT NOW. That's exactly what happened back in January in the first Gamma Squeeze. Good sign!

**EDIT8(1:43PM): CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ROSE 25 %!!!!! (That's a huge indication!) Also: TECH Stocks are in deep red again. Propably Hedgefunds sellings other assets to prepare for a huge buy of GME.**

EDIT9(2:17PM): **Because lots of people ask me for a prediction for today, here is what I think is gonna happen:** There are a lot of options in between $135 and $250 (Around 70,000). I think it's still part of my options chain prediction from yesterday. Institution (the ones on Our side) are gonna try to drive up the price in about 45 minutes from now on (3PM EST). Take into consideration, that on our way up there are gonna be about 2 - 3 trading halts. If we close above $200 there are about 60.000 options becoming ITM. That means, over 6,000,000 shares could be bought in an instant, if those options are gonna be exercised. So the $200 mark is the one that Institutions want to close above in order for the gamma squeeze to happen in full extent tomorrow. **My prediction is: We close between $200 and $220 with a sudden spike in price and volume, starting at around 3PM EST.** This is just my thought, no financial advice.

EDIT10(2:45PM): I added up all of the shorts at the opening! 1**8,363,000 (18 Million, yes!) Shares were sold short at the beginning of the market.** The fact that we are still running up high shows, that Hedgies are fuk.

EDIT11(3:30PM): **CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ROSE 40 %!**

EDIT12: Seems like my predictions was right! (If you turn the graph upside down). I am analyzing the data after the market closes to see if there is a reason for that huge drop-off. You win some you lose some. See y'all tomorrow!

**FINAL EDIT: WHY WAS MY PREDICTION OFF TODAY?** I tought Hedgies are about to give up. But no. These Fuckers just shorted over 33,000,000 more shares. They are in really deep shit, just to survive some more weeks. I knew they were retarded, but this is a level of retardation, that no one could've forseen.

Today was an interesting day!

It started off with a surgical strike to get on the SSR list again for tomorrow, then bringing the stock back up within 15 minutes to the day's open price!

&#x200B;

>Edit: several people has messaged me that it is not on the list for tomorrow and send me the NASDAQ list. THIS IS NOT THE LIST GME WILL APPEAR. IT is on the NYSE list and you can find them here: [https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-arca/notices](https://www.nyse.com/markets/nyse-arca/notices)

After that, it just seemed like a boring day, right? **WRONG!**

All of today's ups and downs were **very well calculated to ensure the stock was never overbought, but continued to force those betting against the stock to bleed their reserve shares without letting the price go too low to let them buy more at a discount** (I mean look at that [PERFECT VWAP Line \[Purple line\]](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp#:~:text=The%20volume%20weighted%20average%20price%20(VWAP)%20is%20a%20trading%20benchmark,and%20value%20of%20a%20security)).

A reminder, when a stock is on the SSR list, it can only be shorted on the upticks (i.e., when the stock is increasing in value). **This does not mean you cannot sell actual stock that you own,** but that means you have to actually own stock, **not just borrow someone else's**.

&#x200B;

This means, that if an institution wants to **deflate the price**, they have to **already own shares** and then **sell them**. Those betting against the stock would already own a lot of stock for this exact purpose (probably purchased when it was sub $100), with the hopes that they can **keep the price down until they can short it again the next day**. However that plan went down the drain once **GME hit the SSR limit as they need to make those shares last TWO days.**

&#x200B;

**Edit:** I pulled some of the regression trends for all the upswings today and they are BEAUTIFUL. All between 0.84 and 0.96. Its almost like it was a computer doing it...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When you look at the data below, you can see that GME never goes above 70 on the RSI band ([Click Here to learn about RSI](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp)), meaning the **stock was never overbought.** Instead it just slowly rises to the 70 and then eases off (I'm sure a very expensive program does this).

&#x200B;

If it went too high, there is a risk it could rebound and drop the price, allowing short sellers to buy up cheap shares to refill their supply. GME hit the 70 mark 6 times today, but it only hit the 30 mark three, (ie oversold), since short sellers were just slowly selling shares as needed to keep the price flat and trying to not exhaust their supply.

&#x200B;

The only time it went outside this band was during the last 5 min when they tried to bring down the price, but you can see that corrected very quickly before the day ended, and it went right up to $260 the second the market closed!

**What I believe happened today was institutions bleeding dry the short sellers of their reserve shares so that tomorrow they will have a reduced ability to stop the rally.** Think of this as a Zergling rush before you storm the base.

&#x200B;

[Stop it! That tickles!](https://preview.redd.it/g3ir2tvougm61.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=195895bc082684b076e1cdc739a1e6f73007f9c2)

Thanks u/zirdc for sending me the tweet below that talks a about how keeping the price flat is important to have full access to Friday's options!

\---------- **So what will happen today** **~~tomorrow~~**\*\*?\*\*

I think the same institution that got GME onto the SSR list today will try to do it again. They will get the stock down in premarket again and very quickly hit the 10% SSR. This would mean 3 full days of no shorting.

If this happens, it could be another 'slow day' of letting the shorts bleed the rest of their reserve stock, with probably the first push in the last hour or two to get as many of the options in the money before the market closes.

**Edit: since we were up 5% in premarket, this would suggest they are not looking to hit the SSR today and it will be pushing the stock as high as they can!**

&#x200B;

\---------- **TLDR**

**Today was intentionally a flat day to make short sellers bleed their reserve stock so they have less when the real gamma squeeze happens in the next day or two. Strap in for the ride** 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

\-------- **Bonus! SSR Data**

I noticed there was not a post that had all the days GME went on the SSR list, so I went through all the files and compiled it.

Edit: A few people asked to see what the price did the next day. I have added the column.

https://preview.redd.it/qc452d2tthm61.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0fa67e8fe3680d4843f5563fa7c26ea5830cd6e

Interestingly, of all those days, yesterday was the only time the stock ended the day with a gain (+7%) . The only other time we were close to 0% was the day before we say 104% price increase the next day.

It is no question that HF’s will try to fuck us before we moon. So let me take a minute to tell you what doesn’t work, and something that can. If we can prepare our holders for this, it’s over, and not for us.

*The numbers I listed as examples below are most likely inflated, but you get the idea, this is a route the HF can still try to play, it is an absolute worst case scenario for us(still results in MAD tendies if hodl/buy) If you look through the comments, a very wrinkly brain debates on the possibility of this, you will read it’s likely HF will get screwed before it reaches these numbers because these numbers will be entirely unmanageable for them to short*

Observe that:
Massively shorting the stock didn’t work before, it’s not working right now, but something will change soon. 

I will explain to you one potential “Hail Mary” play.

They switched their cards around for a reason. When this hits 2-900, and the media and news is telling you AMC is squeezing, they will dump their entire load, and then some with more borrows and synthetics. This COULD potentially bring the price down to 15-100. The media will then tell you that the short squeeze is over. WRONG. This is all part of the plan.

At the peak of that, you will have to make a decision, how true are your diamond hands? How much of a change do you want? Do you really trust the majority of your ape army? 

This will be the very last attempt to get out of this, and if we aren’t prepared for it, it could work. Please have faith in one another, we aren’t trying to change just our lives here, we’re trying to change our grandchildren’s grandchildren’s lives and so forth.

If you think selling even 10 shares won’t hurt, whether to buy back in, or just take profits, don’t you think there are 3 million others wondering the same? You know what will happen if people do this? We will be at a massive risk of them covering, and this whole movement being jeopardized. Months of research and DD that some would say was for nothing.

DON’T trust the news.
DON’T trust any media that is telling you the SQUEEZE is over. 
You know when it could really be over? When they stop talking about it.

TRUST the DD,
TRUST your self, and your gut feeling.

How to win? Simple. Buy. Hodl. 

In the end, this will be your risk, are you taking it? I am.

4. Why this “volume” **can’t** be used to calculate short interest, potential prices or whatever other

~~The middle two being points where people still had questions around and the latter other posters speculating and using them incorrectly (nothing wrong with that, this sub is about improving all our analysis when new information is found!).~~

Let’s get into it!

The same assumption regarding NYSE Chicago being a sandpit for Shitadel and co remains the same from my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdnph0/more_proof_the_115_billion_buy_order_was_real_and/).

Let’s recap what we saw in terms of order behaviour on this exchange over the past 6 months.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y3jcvaeczrp61.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d9eab1540ec5bd37c5f940cc5a4a63e986f9896

We saw volume shift **away** from *Limit Non-Routable IOC* to:

1. IOC ISO
2. Limit Non-displayed
3. Add Liquidity Only (ALO)

These three order types are the keys to the puzzle we’ve been needing, to figure out their strategy to manipulate GME prices. So let’s start off by getting an understanding of what they are!

Bare with the explanations, pretty graphs, charts and some pretty mind boggling conclusions lay beyond the order type explanations.

# 

# IOC ISO (Immediate or Cancel Intermarket Sweep Order)

For those who have not read my previous post find an excerpt below.

[Intermarket sweep order](https://ibkr.info/article/1734)’s are generally a large quantity order that is sent to **multiple exchanges**.This is how it functions:

* An order is submitted in the pre market to sell at a price of 40.80 and is sent to exchange A.
* The best offer price on exchange A is 40.63.
* Exchange B receives an intermarket sweep order to buy 800 shares of the stock at a limit price of 40.88.
* The best offer price on exchange B is 40.88

*The trader that enters the intermarket sweep order would be required to fulfill their Regulation NMS requirement by executing the maximum available quantity on exchange A at 40.63 and then may execute the balance of the order on exchange B at 40.88 even though it is at a price that is inferior to the 40.80 order resting in the book on exchange A. The 40.80 price is not the inside quote and is therefore not ""protected"" in terms of the balance of the sweep order executing at exchange B at a price of 40.88.*

**So in monke speak**, it fills the lowest alternate exchange price before filling the order at the higher price.

To make it more complicated this is an order with a modifier (ISO is the modifier), so let’s understand an IOC.

These are orders which attempt to execute immediately and cancel any unfilled portion. E.g. place a buy for 10 @ $180.01 , it’s only able to be filled to a portion of 5 @ $180.01 and then canceled straight away.

A key part to these types of orders is derived from the following.

*""The intermarket sweep exception enables trading centers that receive sweep orders to execute those orders immediately, without waiting for better priced quotations in other markets to be updated.""*

This is [derived from a response](https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-nyse-2014-32/nyse201432-2.pdf) to change how ALOs work by the NYSE, as they’ve been a thorn in their side since 2014. A prelude to what we’ll go into later. Sounds suspicious right?

*\*nudge nudge\* Almost like they’d be handy for HFTs \*nudge nudge\**

# 

# Limit Non-displayed

An order to buy or sell stock at or better than a specified price, these orders are HIDDEN from us apes and others. They also don’t care about [lock or cross situation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lockedmarket.asp) cases. Refer to [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdnph0/more_proof_the_115_billion_buy_order_was_real_and/) for and understanding on this.

This means the HFT (high frequency traders) can effectively jump the line by posting [“hide not slide”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QmoFpdq9HeGJ-cdPP7y808uWxVufJNr2b69J0GY_-SQ/edit?usp=sharing) orders instead of visible orders. **This is because a hidden order will not be slidden, resetting the timestamp**. So if i placed an order at $120.01 for GME, they then place a hidden order for $120.01 as well, I get my timestamp reset as i’ve placed a locked/cross order, but the hidden order does not get their timestamp reset therefore essentially skipping the fucking line.

Yet another bread and butter tool when it comes to HFT. The key here though is the fact that it’s HIDDEN and how this plays out with ALO order types (IB allows retail to place these orders as well).

# 

# Add Liquidity Only (ALO)

First of all, major thanks to u/SmithEchoes on this bad boy as it’s a complicated beast.

Now this order type is a doozy, and is currently being used for nefarious purposes.

ALO follows a strict “If,then” rule set based on if it locks [(7.31(e)(2)(b)iii-iv)](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37) **OR** crosses [(7.31(e)(2)(b)ii)](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37).  This rule set forces the ALO to perform these trades until it is fully consumed, or the order is canceled.  Rule [7.31(e)(2)(C)](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37), once ALO is resting on the exchange **AND** it was forced to change its price in accordance with [7.31(e)(2)(b)i-iv](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37) **THEN** it now gets to be priced in accordance with [7.31(e)(1)(A)iii and iv](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37). This is the equivalent of HFT when ALO “activates” BUT it comes with a built in safety feature that IF the price goes UP(Sell ALO) or DOWN (buy ALO) the ALO limit price is no longer locking or crossing at the values it was getting moved to, it **REVERTS** back to its original limit order price.

**Monke speak translator:** These orders create sell/buy walls that have a nifty function that essentially “flips the safety switch” back to the original limit order price if too much buy/sell pressure is applied.

Funnily enough, the NYSE has tried to [amend how ALO orders work](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2014/10/16/2014-24547/self-regulatory-organizations-new-york-stock-exchange-llc-nyse-mkt-inc-order-approving-proposed-rule), because of how they can be used for nefarious purposes…. *\*cough\* Shitadel \*cough\** The amendment would force to cancel the ALO once it crosses or locked, and not perform how it currently does in accordance with [7.31(e)(2)(b)i-v](https://nyseguide.srorules.com/rules/document?treeNodeId=csh-da-filter!WKUS-TAL-DOCS-PHC-%7B4A07B716-0F73-46CC-BAC2-43EB20902159%7D--WKUS_TAL_19401%23teid-37). Which means no buy/sell wall capability for them to use and abuse.

The last thing we needa talk about are mother fucking SLPs. This ain’t an order type but it’ll clear up many questions. We’ll then get into analysing price action after this (the fun part).

# 

# SLP (Supplemental Liquidity Providers)

**3/29 Edit: I'm still retainting this as it's factually true of how SLPs function.**

Guess who can be a [SLP](https://www.nyse.com/markets/liquidity-programs)? That’s right. Market Makers.

Our friend, Shitadel is a SLP.

SLPs are pretty simple to understand. They are market participants that use HFT to create high volume on exchanges in order to add liquidity to the markets. This is all done to create *tight spreads*.

SLPs such as Shitadel can artificially create liquidity in the market through **explosively shitting out volume** through the use of HFT methods. **This is important.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jpucmp5fzrp61.png?width=510&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d95d29d66122b4c7702e4b0e8af26e7513415d0

Because GME liquidity has been drying up bit by bit since January-2021, Shitadel and co ~~need to use~~ can use their position as an SLP to ~~manipulate~~ add liquidity into GME~~s price as us apes are hodling~~.

The whole premise of market makers is to remain neutral and to make money through scraping cents of cents off the spread, therefore not directionally affecting the price. ~~However, if i’m on my last legs and feel like doing something illegal, I can use a mixture of the order types above in combination with SLP to manipulate GME at my will.~~

**3/29 Edit:** Removing this reference as i've been unable to dig up any prior evidence that suggests MM who are SLPs have used their position for maket manipulation.

# 

# SLP and Our Beloved TD TOS “Errors”

**3/29 Edit:**

I've only ever seen screenshots of the TD TOS error. SLP and the TD TOS made alot of sense to me given i viewed it as a sort of reserve volume that does not nessecarily need to be used.

I was shown a video of it occuring for the first time and it's changed my opinion on what it is entirely, *IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT'S SLP VOLUME*. I won't speculate in this post about it any further other than saying it should not be used in DD again until it has been 100% concrete clarified what it is. I have therefore adjusted this post to reflect this new beliefs as the order type content and HFT manipulation is still valid given evidence it exists and obviously order types are a thing.

~~Let’s clear up this TD TOS situation once and for all as I’m HIGHLY certain this is exactly what we’re seeing.~~

~~As we’ve said above, Shitadel and co can explosively shit volume into the market. This is exactly what we’re seeing flow through TOS.~~

**~~Myth 1. “BuT iT IsN’T BuY oR sELl”~~**

**~~It’s neither a sell or a buy because it’s both~~**~~. Which is why we see no buy orders or sell orders in TOS in the example below. It’s also why we can’t project prices using it, so any post you see trying to do that to justify the value of GME, it’s just not true as not all of it needs to be executed. Apologies.~~

**~~Myth 1. “BuT iT hAppEnS to OtHEr TiCkeRs”~~**

~~It’s also commonplace within the market, which is why we see it pop up for other stocks. In general, SLP is good because it does create those tighter spreads. But it sure as hell can be used for manipulation if the SLP wants to take illegal risks to shake retail investors from a certain stock~~ *~~\*cough\* GME \*cough\*~~*~~.~~

# Rewind.

Now we know what we’re talking about, let’s go back to this table. A very juicy pattern starts to emerge which is the huge increases we see in ALO distribution.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fwr7cswjzrp61.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe7d3ba75b4014d179c36c6cf995b145bf47fe34

When we look at historical *NYSE Chicago volume*, we see visible step changes in the highs that sussly match up with ALOs monthly increases.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n98d42zkzrp61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=76d4b13baaf6e2e2bfb57c84518083f3b74fef41

This leads me to believe they are using ALOs as a buy/sell wall in level 2 data, which helps them to control momentum. However ALOs need to be timed well, as they could be blown away due to pressure from other parties.

So what are the tools that our HFs buddies have to manipulate the price?

1. **IOC ISO orders**
   1. Cross exchange sweep that allows them to get ahead of the order queue to an extent
   2. Used as buy/sell pressure when needed
2. **Limit non-displayed orders**
   1. A hidden order that does not affect the price
   2. Used to offset IOC ISO orders so as a market maker they can remain “neutral” without causing buy/sell pressure
3. **ALO orders**
   1. A order placed to create a buy/sell wall
   2. Used to stop momentum and turn the trend around

Here are the players which they need to factor into their strategy:

1. **Retail investors 📈🐒**
   1. Likely displaying a predictable buying pattern by now
2. **Long Whales 📈🐳**
   1. Shitadel and Co likely know the strategy they are trying to employ (outside of sporadic buy pressure from the equitie side of things
3. **Other parties such as day traders** 📉👿
   1. *Don’t day trade GME for the love of everything good in this world*

# Let’s put it all together!!!!!

**3/29 EDIT: Based on my TD TOS Update above, disregard the TOS Volume i've highlighted in the picture below. The strategy breakdowns logic following the picture however can still be applied to the movements highlighted in the pink rectangles.**

https://preview.redd.it/lmyg2mqmzrp61.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6704aefbe17b150cd44df6dc631e3bb4985ca84

~~I’m taking the three most recent observations of SLP volume from TOS and have marked them on a GME 1 hour candle chart.~~ It’s pretty telling looking at this straight away what’s going on~~. At each of the specific candles i’ve highlighted, we see a~~*~~wall~~* ~~being hit and a reversal in price.~~

**3/29 Edit:** Let's check out the on the graph above where we see major swings in prices. These are highlighted in the **pink rectangles**.

&#x200B;

# Strategy Breakdown

**\~630M @\~$181**

1. Place ALO **sell** order to create a wall in preparation for earnings in after market
2. Use HFT IOC ISO **sell** order to create downward pressure during earnings call and after
3. Use HFT Limit Non-Display **buy** order to remain “neutral” without creating any upward pressure

**\~113M @\~$120**

1. Place IOC ISO buy order to buy up shares on the way up
2. Place Limit buy order to buy up shares on the way up

**\~290M @\~$183**

1. Place ALO **sell** order to create a wall to reduce upward pressure
2. Use HFT IOC ISO **sell** order to create downward pressure
3. Use HFT Limit Non-Display **buy** order to remain “neutral” without creating any upward pressure

# 

# The question is WHY are they doing this?

FTDs.

The shorts know they have to cover a certain amount of FTDs out of pocket each [cycle](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/), they naturally want the price as low as possible in order to do this. Cover implies whatever they could not borrow to use towards covering their FTDs.

Yep, you read that right ape.

**Those screenshots you see from iborrow with borrowed shares disappearing ain’t being used to short the stock, they are being used to cover their FTDs.**

On that bombshell, back to HFT. As mentioned above, they’d want to manage buy pressure and keep the price as low as possible so they sweep up some shares at the lowest price they can.

~~This is what’s happening from the first SLP Volume coming through in the picture above~~. Drop the price, then at the point they can’t drop it much further they start sweeping up shares with IOC ISOs and regular limit orders **to cover the rest of their FTDs they could not through borrowing**. Lastly, they needa put a cap on this so it does not get out of control, so they create a sell wall and start to work the price back down again.

They knew Earnings Release was a good bet to tank the price, they had it all planned out, from the PR campaign MSM was running to even profiting off the spread from the decline to the bounce. ~~due to them adding liquidity into the market as a~~ **~~SL-fucking-P~~**.

**3/29 Edit:** They can still manipulate the price regardless of whether [they are a SLP or not](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2014-229). My theory is that they're using their positions as SLPs for further nefarious purposes - but there is no proof, so i'm stripping it until any evidence comes to light.

Theory time (this whole post is, but humour me as I have the **PERSONAL** belief the above is fairly on point, do your own DD to confirm 😉 ).

# 

# Theory 1 | We Will See It Again

As FTDs are cyclical we will see this behaviour moving forward until the bubble bursts as the FTD cycle slowly grows out of their control. HODL.

~~I base this on the fact that I believe if we had noticed the SLP volume sooner we would be able to match this whole post to exactly what happened in late February below (with a few variations in strategy dependent on their options spread).~~

**3/29 Edit:** I still believe this to be true, the run up in the chart below and the ""flash crash"" we saw is far too obvious in terms of what they were trying to accomplish. I believe they were apply buy pressure to drive the price up, likely grabbing what shares they can in the process to cover their FTDs, before dropping the price drastically within minutes (of which there are sevrel possible methods of doing based on what i understand, however i will not speculate until i've looked into the details of it).

https://preview.redd.it/6fltgujozrp61.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5b38abb929ece9d9c8533e8b79aab0ef0498396

# 

# Theory 2 | Options and Long Whales

Shorts are trying to balance two plates.

1. Covering FTDs
2. Making money to cover those FTDs through options

They are carefully managing how they can use their HFT strategy using their status as a SLP and to make money on options as well to fund covering FTDs among other things like paying employees etc..

This is where the long whales come in, historically in MY EYES, whales are responsible for the spike in price on the 24th February to just under the $200 mark. Since then and much before, they contributed little volume. It’s entirely made up of HFT and retail investors buying.

Where they do play into this and i think is a valid theory is using their weight when it matters to inflict [max pain](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mejp0k/the_concept_of_max_pain_and_why_this_is_probably/) (post suggest whales pushed up price, that’s not true based on everything in this post, but it’s entirely valid that they slowed it down so the price upon market close on friday would inflict max pain).

# 

# Conclusion

Wow, that was a lot. As such, take time to take it in and properly understand it. As always, PM or comment and I'll clear things up as best I can.

This has been going on since as early as October when we first witnessed a huge shift in order strategy. SLPs are meant to be a “good” thing for the market, ~~but as always, there is room to misuse their positions as market makers to yet again fuck over retail investors.~~

**3/29 Edit:** The last sentence in this post is unsubstantiated, upon digging i've been unable to find evidence that would suggest this. However saying this HFT manipulation [is very much a real thing](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2014-229) (Lots more evidence out there), which is why alot of the concepts in this post are still valid.

~~Best part about this is, when we see SLPs volume come through in TD TOS, we can likely with a~~ **~~reasonable degree of accuracy predict price movements.~~**

**3/29 Edit:** This was stupid and dangerous of me to write (especially the prediction component). I believe my feelings got caught up in the process of writing this DD given it took a long time to research and write.

And last last note i promise, this is why using TA analysis ON ITS OWN is dangerous as it doesn't know what’s actually going on.

**3/29 Edit:** I was chatting with a researcher from the GME discord server who it extremely knowledgeable and insightful. TLDR of the conversation is that i had a bad gut feeling about SLP and it aligned with her gut feeling.  Therefore without evidence of SLP being used for nefarious purposes, i've adjusted my post to reflect this.

# 

# TLDR;

**3/29 Edit: The following points are theories, theories are okay. It helps spur healthy conversation and allows others to raise conjecture which is what we need in this sub.**

The shorts are in a death spiral of borrowing to cover FTDs and using HFT trading tactics to cover the remaining FTDs that the borrowed shares could not.

Whales are on our side, but are putting their effort into controlling buy/sell pressure on certain days to inflict max pain on the shorts options spread.

The price action we are seeing is largely made up of HFTs, Retail, the odd day trader or two (don’t fucking do it).

This ain't financial advice yo, just an ape analysing data and reading boring as fuck SEC filings.

This literally defeats the point of all the holding you've been doing for the past month or more. Everytime you sell for those quick profits, you give them shares to cover with for pennies of their worth. Not to mention you are treading dangerous waters with the day trading rules. 

If you are a believer in the squeeze then stop doing this.

To all my lost GME HODL apes on r/wallstreetbets who are reading this on the front page, if you want good GME DD and info, you won't find it there. That sub has been compromised since late Jan early Feb. The mods let in some GME fluff and non important posts through, but they delete genuine important info that will help you with the squeeze. This type of important content is only found here on r/GME. That's why this DD for example is posted here and not on r/wallstreetbets. So if you're relying on r/wallstreetbets for good DD, please, join r/GME instead. Education and knowledge is power.

So you've been combating FUD, HODLing, reading DD, and buying the dip cuz you like the stock. Congratz, you have been doing well on the front lines and you've been surviving. But this is actually just the easy part. The hardest part is actually knowing when to sell and actually turning those shares into tendies, because obviously it doesn't matter how much we hold if we mess up during the squeeze and fail to capture most of the value of the shares. And that's why we're going to add a wrinkle on your ape brain today and discuss about your EXIT STRATEGY.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

# What is an EXIT STRATEGY, and why is it important?

This really pains me that a bunch of apes have been asking what an EXIT STRATEGY is, as this is something ALL apes should know. An EXIT STRATEGY is your plan for how and when to sell your shares. This is arguably the most important part of trading, as this directly affects how much money you're getting. Obviously we're not going to rely on just emotions, or luck, or just YOLO / 360noscoping the sell button arbitrarily during the squeeze, but we're gonna use our wrinkles to get a better educated guess as to when we're going to sell our shares. Not knowing how to sell our shares well will not only give you as an individual less profit, but also might hinder the squeeze and rob the rocket of rocket fuel, meaning the squeeze won't be as high as it could have been, and meaning ALL APES will have less profit. So read, learn, grow a wrinkle or two, and don't fuck it up for the rest of us!

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Some new/repeated points that needs to be reiterated or may not have been covered above:

- GME holders don't want to sell on the way up, but they'd **want to start selling after the peak on the way down**, to minimize the regret of selling at $10k but seeing the stock hitting $1 mil. Plus selling on the way down ensures the stock can reach it's max price.

- **We don't need to worry much about paper hands selling early** at like $5k or $10k because they make up only a small part of retail investors, and because of the short interest is estimated to be anywhere from 200% - 300% all the way to over 500%, it means our wallstreet bagholder shorters will need to buy these shares back multiple times to cover their position, so even if they buy all the paper hand shares, they'll need to do it again multiples of times to even start to cover.

- The short squeeze isn't going to last for 2 minutes and that's it. From previous short squeezes, **the build up to the top will last for days, so you'll have PLENTY of time to see it coming**. And even at the very top, the price will bounce around a bit before heading down again to earth, so you'll have plenty of time to sell.

- **When you sell, sell with a limit order, not a market order**, because you don't want some freak accident or some illegal shinnanigans where the stock price is worth $1 mil but because you did a market order sell, you somehow got only $50k for your share. If your broker doesn't allow you to do limit sells, it's okay you can do market order sell, but expect there to be a difference (usually small buy sometimes bigger during times of high volatility) between the market price you see reported on your brokerage platform vs the actual price you sell it at. The problem with limit order selling is that you have to manually view the price all the the time, waiting for the price to hit whatever level you were planning to sell at.Using a stop-limit sell order though automatically activates the limit order after the stop price has been reached, and you can also set the limit sell price that activates once the price reaches that point. Warning, in times of EXTREME volatility, if you set your limit too close to the current price, there is a chance it won't execute. For example, if the stock is dropping from $1 mil, and you go and spend a minute to set up a limit set order at $990k, by the time you finish clicking and typing, the price could already be at $980k by the time you submit the order, and your order won't fill. Best to have looser sell limit of like maybe 5-10% below current price, or even more, during times of extreme volatility.If you want to, you can also set a trailing stop limit order, which is something that limits how much you can lose but doesn't cap the gain. The issue with setting a trailing stop limit order is that if you don't set it properly, ie, not giving yourself enough room, then potentially any volatile spikes downwards on the rocket ride up could accidentally trigger those stop loss limits and make you sell prematurely, kicking you off the rocket before it arrives at andromeda. For example, in the $DRYS example in the linked DD, if you set your trailing stop loss to be 10%, then you would have gotten kicked off the rocket at only a little past half way. If you just use a plain old limit order sell, then that gives you the most control. I guess you could also set a trailing stop limit order sell at 10% below current price once the price goes past your target price.For more info: [https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-15#:\~:text=A%20trailing%20stop%20order%20is,is%20not%20a%20specific%20price.&text=However%2C%20if%20the%20security's%20price,reaches%20the%20trailing%20stop%20price](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/general-resources/news-alerts/alerts-bulletins/investor-bulletins-15#:~:text=A%20trailing%20stop%20order%20is,is%20not%20a%20specific%20price.&text=However%2C%20if%20the%20security's%20price,reaches%20the%20trailing%20stop%20price).

EDIT: Some have told me they can't set limit sell orders below current market price. If that's the case maybe it's better to set a stop loss sell order so when the price hits that stop price, the order will fill. Problem with that is your order won't execute right away if the price remains higher than your stop price. Or just do a market sell order and hope the actual sell price is close to the reported sell price when you submit the order. Each brokerage behaves a little differently so it's best to get to know the ins and outs of your own particular brokerage. 

- **Don't panic when the price halts**. It's supposed to halt when there is a drastic change in price, either up or down. Because of these price halts, you'll have even more time to react when the price sky rockets.[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tradinghalt.asp)[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/circuitbreaker.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/circuitbreaker.asp)

- Make sure your brokerage actually allows you to sell your shares at over a mil. I've heard some brokerages have a limit on how big your order can be or maybe have limits to your account itself. Example, if the brokerage has a limit on transactions being less than a mil, then you'd be screwed if you're trying to sell GME for more than a mil. Also, it's a bit different than being allowed to set limit prices at like a mil while the current price is still $200. Even for the broker I use, Questrade, they said there is a limit to what price you can set a limit sell order at, and that limit changes depending on the stock price. So if GME rockets, so should the limit sell price cap.

Also, don't ask me about your particular broker, I'm a Canadian ape and all I know is that Questrade allows for unlimited shinnanigans at any price, cuz I talked to them this morning. With the heart of a partial GME owner, you gotta seize your fate in your own hands and ask your broker yourself. Once you have the answer, what we could do is compile the answers here so everyone can see.

- Watch the volume as well. It's expected the volume to increase signicantly during the squeeze, probably being at it's max around half way into the squeeze, and tapering off towards the top of the squeeze. Conversely, the sell volume will be almost non-existant in the middle of the squeeze, and will increase gradually as we get to the top and then down on the other side back to earth.[https://www.thebalance.com/buying-and-selling-volume-1031027#:\~:text=Total%20volume%20is%20made%20up,were%20associated%20with%20selling%20trades](https://www.thebalance.com/buying-and-selling-volume-1031027#:~:text=Total%20volume%20is%20made%20up,were%20associated%20with%20selling%20trades).

- Also, make sure you have access to multiple ways to access your account to sell. IE: Don't rely on your ghetto phone at like 3% on the day of the squeeze to sell on your app. Have multiple devices ready, phones, laptops, desktops, all set up to log in quick and to issue sell orders at a moment's notice.

**- lastly, the peak will not be whatever number you want it to be, or whatever number we all want it to be. The peak will be the peak, and it could be what we think or hope it could be or it could not. Don't just blindly hold to a certain number thinking that it's gonna be the peak. You must always check all the indicators as the squeeze is happening and monitor carefully so you don't miss the peak. All the prices we've been asking for are theoretical. None of us are prophets. Do your own due diligence during the squeeze, don't rely on others.**

⭐EXIT STRATEGY EXAMPLE⭐I'm sitting here masturbating and suddenly the price jumps from trading sideways at $200-$300 to $400. I know something's up. So I now actually stay paying attention to the price. The price goes up past $1k. Okay, maybe the gamma squeeze is transforming to the short squeeze. There has been a LOT of halts along the way, but it's fine, because As the price is rising, in my head I'm thinking that the share will go past $100k, so if there are slight dips along the way I don't panic. I am also keeping an eye on technical analysis indicators in the above linked DDs to try and guess where the top is. Let's say the price has reached $1 mil, and it paused there, and the indicators are starting to point to a reversal. Whether $1 mil is the top or not, we don't know, but we can still wait  to see if it breaks out and rockets up further. At that point I could:

1. Put in a 10% trailing stop limit sell order on my shares at $1 mil. If it goes up, then I will still get the gainz, but if it goes down 10%, then it'll fill the sell order. At that point, I have to be okay with potentially getting kicked off the rocket during a volatile down spike, as selling at $900k is still great. And I don't think at that point near the top there would be any more volatile movements of 10% or more, but this is pure speculation.
2. Use a stop limit order of $950k (if the price is heading down pretty quickly, a $50k difference from the top will hopefully allow my limit orders to all fill) and sell 50% of my shares, and with the rest, wait for the stock to continue to go up or down. Let's say it starts to drop. It goes back to $900k. At that point, although maybe I don't know if $1 mil is the top, I'm going to make a gut guess it is, based on indicators and how much I personally want to profit from this whole thing. So then I will now attempt to sell maybe 50% of my remaining shares. I go on my brokerage and set a sell limit order at $870k, which is slightly less than the current price of $890k, to account for the continual dropping of the price. Hopefully most of my order will execute and I'd have filled most of the order at $870k or higher. In case I still have some shares leftover, I'd put in another limit order sell at maybe $40k less than the current price, and try again. With the remaining 25% of my total shares, I could then again wait. If the price goes back up, then great, I have another chance to sell for $1 mil or higher. If it goes down, then I'd sell the rest of it at $700k. Overall, in this hypothetical scenario, because I've staggered how I sold, I made sure that I still had chances to ride the rocket up past $1 mil to the true peak, if the peak wasn't $1 mil

$1 mil per share is just an arbitrary price point I picked to illustrate an example. Could be higher , could be lower, no one knows. I don't know how high it'll moon, that's why this post exists in the first place, so you do the DD and know the technicals so you can guesstimate where the top is when it happens. The numberes can change, but the strategy won't. $1 mil is just fun to talk about.

# Warning, the ULTIMATE FUD is coming, and the ONLY way to combat it is to have a solid exit strategy NOW.

With the way things are going on our sub, I almost can guarantee when the squeeze starts and when the price hits $1000 or higher, we're gonna be FLOODED with fake DD's saying that it's the peak and here's why, with lots of technical charts and crayons and lines and fancy trading language and other bullshit to try and trick people into selling. If you don't sufficiently do your DD now and understand why $1000 will NOT be the peak, then I can guarantee you you're gonna paper hand and sell at $1000. Knowledge is power, and HFs know that. That's why posts like this gets downvoted to oblivion as soon as it comes out. EDUCATE yourself, form your exit strategy NOW, and stick to it through thick and thin, through the FUD FLOOD armageddon that will come.

Adding to this, as mentioned by another user, while r/GME bans gain p0rn until the whole thing is over, r/wallstreetbets and other subreddits will not, so you're going to see a whole flood of people posting gain p0rn after selling at $1k or $2k, and buying various articles of luxury maybe, like lambos. You have to prepare yourself now for that day when reddit front page is just all GME gain p0rn. Are you also gonna FOMO and paper hand it before GME truly reaches the stars, because the shill tactics then is making it look like everyone else is selling,and you're afraid of being a ""bag holder""? 

Last PSA: I really can't believe it, but some apes don't even know we have a God Tier DD that's pinned to the very top of r/GME. Seriously. Do yourself a favour and go there and read all of the DD. If you do, your hands are gonna be super diamond.

&#x200B;

EDIT 1: Fixed content about limit selling / exit strat example.

EDIT 2: Some are saying not to sell on the way down because there is no more demand and you'll be caught holding the bag, thus you should only sell on the way up. This is only correct if you assume that the very last few shares hedgies need to buy, the last shares out of all 300%+ of outstanding shares, is bought at the very peak, and after that, demand drops to exactly 0% and there is not a single person buying anymore after the peak. But is that a realistic assumption? Up to you to decide. My thinking is that there will be sellers who sell on the way up, and there will be buyers as well on the way up. But some people will wait until the peak and sell on the way down, just like there may be buyers who wait until after the peak and buy on the way down. I personally don't believe there is a hard cut off at the peak where the buy volume suddenly drops to 0. 

TL;DR

Ape ask: WHERE PEAK?

Fellow ape answer: Ape need read DD.

But as we know in this ongoing GME saga, anything could happen tomorrow.  So far, the momentum has carried into AH.  We'll know a lot more pre-market.

\---

Not investment advice.  Not legal advice.  Not mental health advice.  Do your own due diligence.  Make your own decisions.  This is just speculation.

So far today (~~2:48pm EST~~ ~~3:03PM EST 3:17PM EST~~ 3:33PM EST), there have been ~~206.83k~~ ~~214.43K~~ ~~238.49K 250.0K~~ 266.33K calls purchased versus ~~173.48k~~ ~~180.96k~~ ~~196.02K~~ ~~204.27K~~ 212.55K puts purchased (a put/call ratio of ~~0.843~~ ~~0.822~~ ~~0.815~~ 0.798) \[edit8: which means the disparity gap of calls over puts is still getting larger by the minute\].  The volume was similar yesterday.   I am hoping most of these calls were purchased deep in the money (like I did yesterday as explained here: [I Bought Deep In-The-Money Calls](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mciozx/i_didnt_merely_buy_more_shares_today_i_bought/)).  3/26 $150c this morning opened at $2.60 and have been as high as $34.72.  I picked up a few more this morning.  MMs are certainly going to have to delta hedge those calls given the price action this week.  Besides the long side day-traders profit taking and ongoing short attacks (a 10% intra-day pullback from daily high is completely natural as the stock runs higher), we are on target to close above $175 (or at least get there AH).  If and when that happens, there will be an immense amount of delta hedging by the MMs since the stock was hovering in the $110s last night.  Although a gamma squeeze was unlikely when the stock was trading in the $200s (especially given the extremely high premiums), the shorts attack on the stock gave us an opportunity to load up on deeply discounted call options.  This is what happens when you artificially crash a price where market sentiment is the mirror opposite and without a negative catalyst.  That quick of a price drop absent a negative catalyst, and 9 times out of 10 you'll see a snap back to the VWAP.  Oh, and don't forget the day-trade short sellers who are going to have to buy out their short positions since they will not want to hold them overnight.  This thing could rocket into the $200s before week end.  If you look back at the VW chart, there was a big dip before the big squeeze.....

TL/DR: I'm not saying it will happen; but it is certainly a possibility.  And a 25-50% spike due to a gamma squeeze could trigger the *actual* squeeze.

\*\*\*EDIT 1\*\*\* Typos

\*\*\*EDIT 2\*\*\* I'll update the numbers and/or repost this once market closes to give the actual number of options volume contracts purchased and the ratio.

\*\*\*EDIT 3\*\*\* Updated figures.  A key is that the call volume outweighs the put volume (the put/call ratio is 0.842).  When the option activity is lopsided, MMs have to hedge long or short (depending on which whether the call or put volume is getting the bigger attention).

\*\*\*EDIT 4\*\*\* The $175C options are now in the money...  And, as updated above, the put/call ratio is increasing (now it is 0.815).

\*\*\*EDIT 5\*\*\* (3:08 PM EST) As per the typical playbook, here comes the day-trade short sellers doubling down in panic to try to reverse the momentum.  Volume is too high.  It won't work.  (IMHO)

\*\*\*EDIT 6\*\*\* (3:15 PM EST) The drop in the RSI from 70ish to 60ish shows the shorts are putting downward pressure.  But its weak pressure (moreso panicking day-traders on short side than coordinated HFs on the short side).  Updated figures above,  the put/call ratio keeps getting larger (i.e., more disparity of calls over puts).

\*\*\*EDIT 7\*\*\* (3:20 PM EST) Although the RSI dropped (indicating downward pressure on the price), the short-term MAC-D is still 1 point above the signal line, which indicates the momentum is still bullish (and the downward pressure on price is artificial and not reflective of true market sentiment).  You can just feel the tension building....

\*\*\*EDIT 8\*\*\* (3:28 PM EST) I've gotten some DMs about why I picked up the call options yesterday.  I explained my thoughts a bit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mciozx/i_didnt_merely_buy_more_shares_today_i_bought/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcea8r/thoughts_on_todays_manufactured_price_action/).  We still need follow-through volume from the bulls tomorrow for the price to hold.  But by overattacking the stock (a stock that some people with big money want to see go up), they overdid it.  The stock behaved so abnormally to traditional technical analysis and indicators that I thought a bull run today would be a big possibility.  I just got the sense that a lot of people were hovering over the ""buy"" button waiting for the bottom.  A lot can still happen. Nothing is guaranteed.  I am just saying the *possibility* is there to follow the gamma squeezes in January and February.  If it does gamma squeeze, is this something that is going to start happening once a month?  Guess we will find out.  (Also, updated figures above.  The put/call ratio difference keeps growing).

~~\*\*\*EDIT 9\*\*\* (3:42 PM EST)~~ \*\*\*EDIT 14\*\*\*  Apologies to u/Whiskiz, but I am removing the link to the VW short squeeze based on some of the comments I have received.  I definitely do not want anyone to misinterpret anything I say or create false hope or expectation.  This is really a completely different situation, and a first of its kind.  I don't want anyone to misinterpret the VW chart as saying that is what I believe will happen here--it is unprecedented so the price action will be as well.  Link removed.

\*\*\*EDIT 10\*\*\* (3:51 PM EDT).  As u/Kourafas pointed out, it is ""EDT""  not ""EST"".  Fixed.  I'll update the call/put volume on market close.  In response to u/SquierrellyDave this is actual call/put volume. The data is courtesy of [www.trade-ideas.com](https://www.trade-ideas.com).   Also, I am not promising a date.  I am not promising a gamma squeeze.  I am not promising the price will go anywhere.  I've only been day trading for about a year.  I have a lot to learn.  Certainly not claiming to be an expert.

\*\*\*EDIT 11\*\*\* (4:01 PM EDT).  Updated with new numbers.  **Final numbers:  Call volume of 294.18K vs. put volume of 230.97K (a put/call ratio of 0.785).**  I'll need to dig (perhaps someone can help) to find out how many of the calls are in the money, almost in-the-money, or lotto tickets (e.g., $800).  The reason I think this is ripe for a gamma squeeze (which is NOT a short squeeze) is because the price was $115 this morning.  At that price, the $150,  $175 and $200 calls were way out of the money.  The further out of the money the calls are, the less likely the price will reach the strike price.  The less likely the price will reach the strike price, the less shares MMs need to purchase to hedge.  A gamma squeeze (which I believe is what caused the spikes in January and February) was not a possibility until the HFs over-attacked the price yesterday.

\*\*\*EDIT 12\*\*\* I was going to post this in a comment but adding an edit here for everyone.  This is in response to u/Idjek's question.

So a call/put option is a contract.  The contract gives you the right (but not the obligation) to purchase (call) or sell (put) shares at the strike price.  Most people who have in-the-money call options (which means the market price is higher than the strike price \[further simplified you are making money on the option\]) will sell them for a profit, or if they expire without being exercised they will be compensated at fair market value if the option holder does not have the cash on hand for it to be exercised.

A call option is the right to buy 100 shares at the strike price.  So if I purchased 3 $150 call options that expire tomorrow, that means even if the stock price is at $250, I have the right to purchase 300 shares at a price of $150.  That's still a big nut ($45K) which most people cannot afford.  Even if no one holding an in-the-money (profitable) call option executes the option tomorrow, the market makers still need to have enough stock on hand to deliver it just in case someone (or multiple people) does executes the option (contractual right) to purchase the stock at the strike price.

The theory behind a gamma squeeze is, when enough people load up on call options, the market makers have to acquire shares for the possibility that the call options are both in-the-money (profitable) and exercised (the holder exercises the option to purchase the 100 shares).

The other key is the disproportionate number of calls to puts.  If there are an even number of calls and puts, then the option activity itself is hedged (so the brokers and MMS are risk-neutral on the options).  Think of it like sports betting.  If heavy betting is coming in on one side, Vegas moves the odds to encourage betting on the other side and even-out the activity.  Rather than ""move the odds line"", the MMs have to buy/sell shares to be risk-neutral on the options activity.

The market makers usually buy and sell shares slowly throughout the day to keep up with the options volume--so they are hedging real-time and it doesn't really effect the stock price.  When there is a sudden heavy surge of call volume + a huge swing in the price upwards, that unexpected movement causes a sudden need for the MMs to acquire an abnormally larger number of shares.  If they did not already have them on hand, they need to acquire them to stay risk-neutral.   How many shares they buy/sell is probably all done by computers and algo formulas.

On a basic level, everyone would lose faith in the market if someone tried to exercise an in-the-money call option and the broker said: ""sorry, no shares available"" or ""sorry, I don't have them.""  The brokers MUST be in a position to deliver the shares (via the Market Makers) if a call option is exercised.

\*\*\*EDIT 13\*\*\* I've gotten a few comments about my analysis, etc.  This is all just a hunch based on experience and studying.  This is definately a rigged game, we all know that.  But studying and learning has helped me try to make money by tailing the whales.

Here are a few books that I highly, highly recommend:

(1) ""*A Complete Guide to Volume Price Analysis*"" by Anna Couling \[she explains the importance of volume and how it never lies.  Back in the days of pit traders, the traders use to ""sense"" the markets shifting and could coat-tail the shift to make money.  At the time they, had a number of words for it...but what they were really sensing was volume.""\]

(2) ""*The Ultimate Price Action Trading Guide*"" by Mangi Madang

(3) ""*Trading In the Zone*"" by Mark Douglas

There are also tons of videos online from people that know what they are doing.  You have to watch and study price action.  There is no shortcut to it.  I certainly am no expert.  But by studying charts and price action, it has helped me TIME my trades better, look to trade at support/resistance levels, wait for the volume to confirm a break-out, etc.

\*\*\*EDIT 15\*\*\* My data is based on the call volume (per trade-ideas, which is a stock screening platform I use).  I don't know what portion of the call volume is people (like me) who bought and are holding call options, or people who flipped them as the price went up.  Thanks to u/87CSD, here is some data on the actual option contract activity.

According to this page: [https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/](https://gme.crazyawesomecompany.com/)

March 26:

ITM calls = 14,418

OTM calls = 80,541

ITM puts = 6,879

OTM puts = 139,575

&#x200B;

\*\*\*EDIT 17\*\*\* Courtesy of u/manifestingmoola2020, here is some additional information about today's options activity.  More info is always a good thing.

I was hoping this info would be useful. I dont think its all options activity based on your call/put ratio, but if you find this useful please feel free to share. This data is from a monthly chat service i pay for and i dont know how its accumulated.

Option flow data from today is as follows:

\*\*\*EDIT 18\*\*\* (3-26-201, 12:38 PM EDT)   Although I thought yesterday the conditions were ripe for a gamma squeeze, as I said, we needed bull momentum to continue into today. So the landscape--for now--has changed. Looks to me like $190 is where we consolidate, but I think we break out back up to the $200s soon. I still think we have a good chance to close above $225.  But the shorts will continue to attack at key support and resistance points to try to trigger panic and algo selling.  Since volume is low right now, we may be in for another short attack to try to break trend. ",2021-03-25 19:36:07

Change My Mind.",1616944345.0,"# Thesis Statement / AKA TLDR

I believe Naked shorting has allowed GameStop’s circulating shares to number above 1 Billion, with a minimum short interest percent of float to be 2000%. Thus, it can also be concluded retail likely owns upwards of 500 million shares and the financial impact is likely upwards of $100 trillion. DTCC came to this same conclusion around mid-March and is now actively taking steps to crash the entire market, allowing them to socialize losses to other major players in the market.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# EDIT May 26, 2021:

Since this seems to be getting some visibility again, I'll provide a quick update to my estimates. If I ever stop being a slacker I'll write up a formal argument to support my updated numbers. Until then, I'll just provide my updated thesis statement.

# Updated Thesis Statement

I believe a variety of shorting loopholes exploited by bona fide market makers have allowed GameStop’s circulating shares to number in the multiple billions of shares with SI likely being somewhere between 3,000% - 10,000% (assuming the tradeable float is \~30M shares). Thus, it can also be concluded retail likely owns the float dozens of times over (a specific number seems irrelevant at that point). I estimate the potential financial impact to be a $1quadrillion+ extinction level event for the financial system as we know it today. The DTCC members have been taking proactive measures to prepare for such an event, but only time will tell if their best attempts to prepare will actually make a difference for the potential outcome.

&#x200B;

**Needless to say, I still like the stock.**

# Disclaimers

This is a thesis argument; thus, it is not financial advice.

This thesis is primarily math and logic-based speculation; thus, it should not be considered as factual.

I hope that by sharing these thesis:

* Apes will gain useful insights.
* Progress the knowledge within our community.
* It can serve as some entertainment and dat sweet confirmation bias porn we all love.
* Most importantly, the community can review and critique this argument allowing major holes in the logic to be discovered and the thesis altered as necessary.

For my own protection, I am using a burner Reddit account and a VPN to post. I will only be logging onto this account sporadically, but I will be watching this thread very carefully through my main account. Just know I may not reply to comments or make edits, but I see all.

# Recap

&#x200B;

[DTCC mid-March, 2021](https://preview.redd.it/ygly4d4piop61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=61691ce29f3ffe2abe223f2c3ac3a7ed870ea13d)

To begin, a quick summary of the previous 6 months. Since I was not here for most of this, I will briefly summarize the events as I see them in hindsight (with little sprinkles of speculation thrown in).

It starts with two opposing sides that cannot agree to disagree. On the short side, GameStop is viewed as a dying brick and mortar company. Melvin Capital, and many other major players, heavily short GameStop, likely even installing several GameStop board members to guarantee a collapse. However, long players (i.e., retail, RC, Blackrock, etc.) see deep fucking value in GameStop. Using the famed and feared “buy and hold” tactic players on the long side put shorts in serious trouble as they have infinite loss potential. I believe as early as fall 2020, Melvin realized their firm might be on the line. This situation worsened for them in the December and January runup that ultimately was Melvin Capital's death sentence. But everyone works for someone, right? Enter in Citadel…

I suspect sometime in the December and January timeframe Citadel realizes they may be looking at tens to hundreds of billions in losses due to Melvin’s short position. So, what does our boy Ken Griffin decide to do? He takes a calculated risk to reduce the negative impact of Melvin’s short position by allowing a fake “squeeze” to occur causing a retail sell off. With the combined powers of price manipulation, media control, and contacts throughout the financial world (one need only watch the Godfather series to understand the importance of this last one), what could possibly go wrong? Well, some guy who’s not a cat didn’t sell, and apparently he wasn’t alone. Furthermore, GameStop’s situation dominated the media and brought in millions of new retail apes (myself included as I previously had zero experience/interest in stocks). I believe this also had another important effect: Citadel now knew the entire multi-hundred billion dollar firm was on the line and **Citadel no longer needed to manage risk**.

We see this in sports all the time. When a team is already losing a game, they will often play all out offense because what is the difference between losing by 1, 2, 10, or 50 points? In any of these outcomes, the game is lost. A similar philosophy can be applied to finance since what is the difference between owing $500B, $700B, $1T, or $50T when the firm is only worth $300B? In any of these outcomes, the firm is lost.

**Throughout February, I believe we saw the effects of hundreds of millions of naked shorts entering circulation**, bringing the price down from about $300 to $40. During this time, we see aggressive media campaigns aimed at distracting potential investors from GameStop and causing investors already long on GameStop to sell (remember silver, weed, RKT, and many more). This game of smoke and mirrors lasts until the middle of March when DTCC can peers into the void and see exactly what the situation is. I think what they saw terrified them, and now they are fighting to not hold the entire bag. Enter in DTCC…

Now we get to the more interesting stuff.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Some Background on DTCC

&#x200B;

To start, WTF even is DTCC?

&#x200B;

[Unrelated Picture](https://preview.redd.it/zyxa96wxnop61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6669920d38be33dcb128517e814295192a136dc)

Well, let us start with a copy pasta definition that I think I took from Investopedia:

&#x200B;

>The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) is an American post-trade financial services company providing clearing and settlement services to the financial markets. It performs the exchange of securities on behalf of buyers and sellers and functions as a central securities depository by providing central custody of securities.

&#x200B;

What does that even mean?!? To answer that the following is taken from “Who Really Owns Your Money?” an article written by Anthony Freed (I will include a link at the end):

&#x200B;

>The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is the biggest bank in the world that you have probably never heard it. They happen to be the **registered owners of 99% of all paper (stocks, bonds, securities, etc.)**. Scary, but true.  
>  
>The **DTCC retains registered ownership while you as the peasant investor have the designation of beneficiary** of the instruments.

&#x200B;

This begs the question, WFT is a beneficiary owner vs a registered holder? Taken from the aforementioned article:

&#x200B;

>REGISTERED HOLDER- A Registered Holder literally possesses, owns, and holds, his stock or bond with his name appearing on the face of the certificate. The company that issued the certificate has registered the owner’s (holder’s) name on their official books. This is the safest way to own a paper asset. You literally possess the fully registered certificate and only you can transfer or sell it. By all Rights and definition of law, you are the owner. You have it, you hold it, you possess it, and you keep it. You have the complete control over it.  
>  
>BENEFICIAL OWNER- A Beneficial Owner is nothing more than a beneficiary, “One who is entitled to the benefit of a contract”- A Dictionary of Law, 1893. All book-entry stocks and bonds you purchase make you the beneficial owner, not the registered holder. The owner of a book-entry stock or bond is the entity or name that it is registered under.

&#x200B;

WTF?!?!?!? Nobody actually owns anything?!?!? That makes no sense! Well, there is a good reason and Freed covers that as well:

&#x200B;

>And they have a perfectly good reason for it - with electronic trading, it is impossible to make timely changes to registered ownership of the paper.

&#x200B;

Ohhhhhh, so **in order to speed up transactions, the DTCC was created to keep all the assets of the stock market under one owner**, well that makes sense. And surely an organization that is the sole owner of 99% of the stock market would be highly regulated and extremely transparent to insure peace of mind for all beneficiary owners, right? I mean, that must be the case, right??? RIGHT?!?!??!??

Personally, I do not believe this is the case after watching the “The Wall Street Conspiracy” movie that has been posted about previously (I will include a link at the end as I also reference this in multiple locations). My take on the TLDR of that documentary is:

**The DTCC is and has always been very loosely regulated, with a history of being culpable regarding naked shorting practices.**

&#x200B;

Also, this is taken from the DTCC Wikipedia page under a section titled “Controversies” (also contains an interesting final sentence):

&#x200B;

>Several companies sued DTCC, without success, over delivery failures in their stocks, alleging culpability for naked short selling. Furthermore, the question of whether DTCC is culpable for naked short selling was raised by Senator Robert Bennett and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA), and discussed in articles in The Wall Street Journal and Euromoney.\[53\]\[54\] DTCC contended that the suits were orchestrated by a small group of lawyers and executives to make money and draw attention from the companies' problems.\[54\]  
>  
>**Critics blamed DTCC, noting that it is the organization in charge of the system where the naked short selling happens, alleging that DTCC turned a blind eye to the problem**, and complaining that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had not taken sufficient action against naked shorting.\[54\] DTCC responded that it had no authority over trading activities, and could not force buy-ins of shares not delivered,\[55\] and suggested that naked shorting was simply not widespread enough to be a major concern. The SEC, however, viewed naked shorting as a sufficiently serious matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice.\[54\] DTCC has said that the SEC has supported its position in legal proceedings.\[55\]\[56\]\[57\]  
>  
>**In July 2007, Senator Bob Bennett, Republican of Utah, suggested on the U.S. Senate floor that the allegations involving DTCC and naked short selling were ""serious enough"" to warrant a hearing. The Senate Banking Committee's Chairman, Senator Christopher Dodd, indicated he was willing to hold such a hearing.\[58\] No such hearing was ever held, however.** Representing state stock regulators, the NASAA filed a brief in a 2009 suit against DTCC, arguing against federal preemption as a defense to the suit. NASAA said that ""if the Investors' claims are taken as true, as they must be on a motion to dismiss, then the entrepreneurs and investors before the Court have been the victims of fraud and manipulation at the hands of the very entities that should be serving their interests by maintaining a fair and efficient national market"".\[59\] The suit was dismissed. Critics also contended that DTCC and the SEC were too secretive with information about where naked shorting was taking place.\[54\] DTCC said it supported releasing more information to the public.\[55\]  
>  
>In recent years this controversy only increased as the reactive effect of Gamestop stock dramatically damaged the DTCC's reputation.

&#x200B;

So, you are telling me a single organization that has a history marred with accusations of shady activity is the registered owner of the entire $60T of stock market assets?

Yes.

And now that I blabbered about the background and DTCC, please allow me to argue for my actual thesis statements.

&#x200B;

# Thesis statement 1: 2000% SI minimum

&#x200B;

“Overtime. Eventually. Math and logic will balance the equation. 💎🙌🏼🦍🚀🌝” – u/bebiased

Soooooo, how the hell am I getting 2000% SI as a conservative estimate? Well, it all starts with these daily “glitches”. To add some credibility here, I am degreed in both electrical and computer engineering, so I come from a technical background. Often it is useful to look at complicated puzzles with the “black box” approach. I will make the following assumptions in doing so:

&#x200B;

* There is significant evidence to support synthetic shares are being created. I don’t give a single fuck **how** they are being created, just that they **are** being created.
* Citadel is a financial beast with multiple different arms that by law must be firewalled (likely meaning no electronics traffic exists between those arms).
* One arm of Citadel might be responsible for creating synthetic shares (might have some connection to the hundreds of millions of shares in darkpools), while another arm is responsible for closing the IOUs.
* This transfer of IOUs cannot be done internally within Citadel due to the firewall. Thus, this transfer must hit the open market in some manner. Once again, I don’t give a single fuck **how** this is happening, just that there is reason to believe it **is** happening.
* Computers are incredibly stupid, but they make up for that with being able to do simple tasks unbelievably quickly and accurately (this is what gives them the illusion of being smart).
* Some computer somewhere saw the traffic accounting for the transfer of IOUs and said “I take number from here and put it there”, because that’s what it is programmed to do. It just so happens the place it puts numbers was in TOS, in plain sight of us retail apes.
* Diagram to illustrate this argument:

&#x200B;

[Sorry the boxes aren't actually black. Credibility -69](https://preview.redd.it/pnz2f1r5top61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=05e40c13a8ea15eb74d179b9c145655b00814190)

&#x200B;

Now that I have presented a theory on how this might be working, let us test this theory against the 94M share “glitch” from February. If my theory is correct, one would expect to see the following:

* Unusually high buy pressure in the days after the February 22 glitch.
* This buying pressure should continue until roughly 94M volume has been recorded.

[DD of 94M Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lq0lwu/why_is_there_a_94_million_share_buy_order_in_for/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

So, let us look at the chart and see. Just FYI this is the 4-hour chart.

&#x200B;

[I can't even fucking read](https://preview.redd.it/pu1rwnohtop61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8ba60d2991f700aec444efadc02f6e5dfe1b151)

I don’t know about you, but my confirmation bias just did a six to midnight. In this chart, we see immense buying pressure push the stock from roughly $45 to reconsolidating above $100 after the buying pressure wore off. Furthermore, we see the buying pressure fall off a cliff once 94M total volume is met (with a bit of FOMO into after market). In my opinion, this is too damn convenient to be coincidence.

**The Major Counter Argument I See**

If there are over 1B shares (and counting) currently waiting to be closed out, why has the price not gone into the 1000s already? While I believe my theory can tell us the number of shorts that need to close, I think it tells us absolutely jack shit about the timing. Also, we have not had stellar success as a community with predicting the timing, so personally, I’m not going to speculate on it.

But what have we seen on the charts since March 23? The average daily volume from March 17-23 is roughly 15M per day (remember that includes a quad witching day). Interestingly, the average daily volume since that 634M “glitch” has been almost 37M. Furthermore, if you look at the price change from close to close the price moved from $181.75 close on March 23 to a $181.00 close on March 26 (interesting that both are right below $182 as this is where the ""glitches"" have come in at). When looking at the price alone, it is not apparent there was significant buying pressure, but we must also remember what was happening concurrently.

Remember this?

[Entire Russel 2000 is Shorted](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbu916/not_my_post_but_it_is_being_downvoted_like_crazy/)

Thus, there was buying pressure coming in from somewhere to cancel out the operational shorting being done on the Russell 2000. I believe the greater than 1B shares waiting to be purchased is the source of this buying pressure.

&#x200B;

**Summarize Thesis Statement 1**

So if I am correct and these “glitches” are giving us an opportunity to see short positions attempting to sneak through the market, I believe we are looking at a running total of roughly 1.2 billion shares. With float being right under 50M, we are looking at (I’ll use 50M and 1B because I’m lazy and prefer speculating on the conservative side):

1,000,000,000 / 50,000,000 = **2000% SI of float at minimum**

1,000,000,000 / 70,000,000 = **1429% SI of outstanding shares at minimum**

Following DD is a more precise calculation indicating **2654% SI of float**

[DD Fair Share Value and SI Estimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me2dm1/true_value_of_a_gme_share_is_722783/)

In my opinion, these numbers should not be that surprising when you consider Citadel has likely been operating with zero risk management and I believe Zach had been predicting SI was possibly 900% weeks ago. And that prediction was made with all the information we knew at the time. And oh yeah, remember this?

&#x200B;

[Apparently there’s dark pools with hundreds of millions of GME shares trading in them.](https://preview.redd.it/o1ergi37wop61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=51a87172d2f60ee5367a73e7a68e2535a086460d)

As history has proven, these financial bubbles are often significantly bigger than anyone realizes before it pops; thus, I consider 2000% SI to be conservative.

&#x200B;

# Thesis Statement 2:  I Estimate a $100 Trillion Financial Impact

&#x200B;

[Hopefully](https://preview.redd.it/8xy2udjswop61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a09ee762ba50d29d1736a6f6b0a0d44cd9bb661)

&#x200B;

And how the fuck did I get to that number? Just hear me out…

To begin, this requires my first thesis to be true (which I give that I reasonably high chance to be the case).

So let’s do some share counting…

The most recent Institutional ownership numbers I saw was 95M shares.

[Fintel Data](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme)

So who owns the other 900M+ shares?

*I’m legitimately asking here since I believe this is one of the weakest parts of my entire argument. I’m hoping the comments have some discussion on this.*

Since I believe retail is the largest non-reported group of shareholders, I’ll assume **retail is likely sitting on 500M shares** and chalk the other 400M up to “shit that I don’t know about” (once again I would love feedback here).

While the exact mechanics of a squeeze this size cannot be predicted, I believe it is reasonable to assume 1 billion shares will have to be reduced to 50M (this is also not even accounting for any of the float being locked up in mutual funds, etfs, etc.).

Thus, by these numbers, the price should continue to rise until roughly 90% of retail shares have sold.

So do you think 10% of retail shares (50M) will be held until at least $2M per share?

If so, 50M \* $2M = $100T

Although this also assumes people only hold until $2M per share. **Personally I don't know why anyone would sell themselves out so cheap at $1M, $2M, or $10M per share.**

And that doesn’t even account for the other 950 million shares!

&#x200B;

**The Major Counter Argument I See**

Literally anything that proves my share counting estimates to be substantially wrong, and believe me, I would love to hear more information on this. I’m looking forward to feedback on the logical steps taken in this section.

&#x200B;

**Summarize Thesis Statement 2**

So if there actually are 1B+ shares currently trading, what effects does this have on the situation as a whole? Well, I believe this makes the potential financial impact one to **dwarf** that of 2008 housing crisis, the 2001 dotcom bubble burst, Black Monday of 1987, and the 1929 Great Depression (accounting for inflation). **By my estimation, the financial impact is looking like $100T on conservative side.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Thesis Statement 3:  DTCC is the Final Boss in its True and Terrible Form and Aims to Crash the Entire Market to Socialize Losses to Other Major Players

&#x200B;

>It’s quite obvious that the stock markets are going to ‘crash and burn’ at some future date and for some ‘unknown’ reason… The Great Depression is about to be repeated, and it will be as **deliberate** and **manipulated** as the first one that began with the stock market crash of 1929. We are, without a doubt, on the brink of the **Mother of all economic Depressions**.

The above quote was penned in 2003 and used by Anthony Freed in his “Who Really Owns Your Money?” article published in 2008. I couldn't find who originally penned this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Getting Back to DTCC**

Remember way back in the Recap section when I said ""Enter in DTCC..."" and left that on somewhat of a cliff hanger? Well now let's unhang that cliff and get to the real crazy shit of this post.

So where would I get the idea that DTCC is the next bag holder in line after Citadel? Well thankfully I came across a lovely DD while typing up this post which saves me from having to explain it:

[DD Explaining DTCC Bagholding Potential](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/meifir/for_the_newbies_on_this_page_trying_to_get_a/)

And the image from that DD so you don't actually have to click the link:

&#x200B;

[Holy Shit this picture is big. Too bad I have no idea how to resize it. Credibility -420](https://preview.redd.it/pddmzw8z5pp61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=effd1864014086b09aea7a133dfa5fde854f9618)

&#x200B;

But remember, I'm speculating the potential bag to be held could easily be $100T, and if DTCC is only worth a measly $60T, they could potentially be fighting for their life (thank goodness they have insurance).

I suspect when DTCC peered into the short positions of Citadel and company they came to a similar conclusion as my previous two thesis have arrived at (I believe the date for this was March 17, but I'm not certain on that). To the best of my knowledge, DTCC is not a player in the market like Citadel, rather I believe they have taken over a puppeteer role towards those in short positions. While DTCC would not literally be the institution making moves on the market, they are dictating what short side institutions do. This idea has risen largely from the sudden change in various tactics we are seeing, which I will cover now in no particular order.

&#x200B;

**New tactic:  Weird Available Short Data**

I noticed a weird change in available shorts starting in the middle of quadruple witching week. Until that week the available shorts had been slowly but steadily showing a general trend of approaching zero. However, that week they actually hit zero, but the interest to borrow stayed low. Due to supply and demand, the rate to borrow should only increase as the available shares to borrow decreases. This activity simply makes no logical sense. The following is a great example of the borrowable shares as I'm typing this.

[Huh?](https://preview.redd.it/u94n2h11bpp61.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d91c09e549947a69b9302af1acb8b2eb8a10788)

At the lowest, we see 10,000 shares available with a meager 1% interest rate. Since this makes no logical sense due to supply and demand, allow me to speculate on the actual play happening here.

I believe the borrowable shares with a low percent fee are being used as honeypot to attract to players to take short positions. This would help socialize losses as potentially more greedy HFs would short GME for a bargain price. This would allow DTCC to first liquidate any new short player assets before having to start dipping into their $60T

&#x200B;

**New Tactic:  Death Threats**

What if I told you that DTCC potentially has a history of doing it? It may sound like a conspiracy theory, but after seeing the main stream media manipulation throughout this whole ordeal, I'm thinking some of you might be more open to believing conspiracy theories. Honestly, I'm not sure I believe it myself, but it's certainly interesting to note that Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne claims he received death threats. Byrne is one of the main people of interest in The Wall Street Conspiracy video and very actively tried to raise awareness of naked shorting. The following is another article which he recounts the details of the threats:

[Patrick Bryne Discusses Death Threats](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/12/14/a-tycoons-deep-state-conspiracy-dive)

&#x200B;

>Byrne has claimed that his work exposing naked shorting resulted in death threats. After he went public with his allegations, he was summoned to a Thai restaurant in Great Neck, Long Island, where he and two associates met a man who warned them that Russian gangsters were planning to \[**Redacted**\] Byrne for having exposed a profitable source of income. The man told them that he had received a package containing *matryoshka*, Russian nesting dolls, with Byrne’s name on a slip of paper inside the smallest one. Around that time, Byrne said, someone threw a pair of garden shears through the window of the Manhattan restaurant that his girlfriend managed.

Brackets indicate edited quote because Reddit does not let me post that one word. See linked article for full quote.

Now I wouldn't it past our boy Kenny Griffin to put out death threats, but I find the timing to be a little suspicious. Perhaps death threats are a tactic used by a new player that entered the game...and maybe that would be the player with the most lose...maybe that would be DTCC...

I'll be interested to see what is sent to this account in the coming days.

&#x200B;

**New Tactic:  Shorting the Muthafukin Russel 2000**

Great DD here that explains mechanically how this ETF shorting works.

[DD Operational Shorting and Market Instability](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md69vo/dd_why_gme_went_up_today_and_how_citadel_may/)

Some quotes I especially like to feed my confirmation bias (the all caps make them even better):

>UPTICK IN RECENT ETF NAKED SHORTING SIGNALS THAT THEY ARE CLOSER TO THEIR REGULATORY LEVERAGE LIMITS.  
>  
>EXPECT MORE NAKED SHORTING OF ETFS BUT THESE ADDITIONAL SHORTING MAY LEAD TO ENTIRE MARKET INSTABILITY

It appears a market crash would happen primarily from increased volatility caused by this excessive shorting. While apes are immune to volatility, in fact many of us were born in it, the boomer market as a whole fears volatility like the plague. If the major indices start to experience just a fraction of the volatility GME experiences on the daily, a rapid sell off is almost guaranteed. Especially if you consider we are currently in one of the most bullish markets ever, and that alone makes the market naturally due for a little correction. And oh yeah, apparently there's some boat stuck in a ditch somewhere? Doesn't seem that important to me, but people are talking about it.

&#x200B;

But is it really Citadel that would be attempting to cause a market crash? Personally, I'm not convinced.

&#x200B;

Let's play a little game called DTCC or Citadel. It's a simple game. I type out a question and then I type an answer to that question. And everyone else get to read my 2 AM stream of consciousness thesis argument after I post this.

Who benefits the most from a market crash?

DTCC

Why? Citadel is already in the position of losing anything, not even a market crash where they load up on short positions can cancel the infinite loss potential of their GME short position. Although, **Citadel loading up on short positions in broad market ETFs before a market crash could serve to lessen the blow of their position for DTCC**.

Who has the financial leverage to cause enough instability for a market crash to occur?

DTCC

Citadel issued $600M in junk bonds several weeks ago. I doubt their financial leverage is at its strongest. And even if it was, Citadel is not the largest fish in the pond; there are fish in the financial pond that would eat Citadel, burp, and ask for more. But what if DTCC is feeding Citadel the necessary leverage and calling the shots for our boy Kenny Griffin? Well then my thesis would be correct.

&#x200B;

**The Major Counter Argument I See**

Its getting late and I don't feel like making one.

**Summarize Thesis Statement 3**

In my opinion, there's too many new tactics that conveniently started popping up around the time DTCC was able to see exactly what short positions on GameStop major players had taken. Thus, I believe a new entity started calling the shots for those on the short side. When I ask myself, ""who has the most to lose?"", I find the most logical conclusion to be DTCC. I think there is potentially a $100T bag that short side players will end up holding, and most of that will be falling on DTCC (and then the Fed since not even DTCC can hold a bag that big). So what's the only play they have left? Well they can't hope to get us to sell as the last two months have proven. But they can attempt to extend the losses to as many other institutions as possible. I just go back to the quote included at the beginning of this section:

>The Great Depression is about to be repeated, and it will be as **deliberate** and **manipulated** as the first one

# Final Thoughts

While typing this up I saw the posts that Josh would be stepping down from doing DD due to the evolving death threat situation. This got me thinking too...

I recall thousands of years ago there was some bearded, sandal wearing guy who mentioned something along the lines of (forgive me paraphrasing):  **""to think a sin is to commit it""**

Ya know, I kind of agree with that statement in this context. In my opinion **these threats should be matched with the same response as there would be to murder**.

Now, this will never happen in the eyes of the law, but that doesn't mean it can't happen in the eyes of apes. So I got to thinking some more...

**If someone is willing to take a human life for these shares, perhaps they're far more valuable than we ever could have anticipated. Truly, what is the value of a human life?**

Each ape will have to come to that conclusion on their own, but **I don't see myself wanting to part with them for a pitiful $10M, $20M, $50M, $100M or $1 Billion per share**.

# The Sec filings

Ok so a lot of people didn't understand the legal wording of the SEC 10K filing so lets do a little rundown of it.

The 10k filing can be found here:

[https://sec.report/Document/0001326380-21-000032/](https://sec.report/Document/0001326380-21-000032/)

In that they DISCRIBE what a short selling is, so let me take you step by step on what this legal talk means ok?

&#x200B;

***A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.***

(short description right? but that's not enough in legal paperwork you need to explain it further)

&#x200B;

**Investors may purchase** shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge **existing exposure or to speculate on the price** of our Class A Common Stock. **Speculation** on the price of our Class A Common Stock **may** involve **long and short exposures.**

**To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market**,

&#x200B;

( the particular degree to which something is or is believed to be the case  = to the extent.

here they're saying they believe it may be over 100% shorted, not sure if that means at end of fiscal year or now)

&#x200B;

investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”

&#x200B;

(they are describing what most of you have seen on [Iborrowdesk.com](https://iborrowdesk.com/) the % of interest).

&#x200B;

Like always don't panic guys, this is an emotional response and I've been telling you to use logic.

Now is this common that they address this kind of stuff in a shareholders letter? no this type of disclosure is very rare, as in extremely so. ([as can be seen here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbtpwa/with_regard_to_the_theyre_just_defining_a_short/))

&#x200B;

From [page 29 of today's 10-K filing](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html), under

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

>Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility **will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.**

Yes, the company retains the option to make an ATM share offering, but they are plainly stating that as it stands right now they don't need to do so to raise capital to meet their plans.

Why wont they do it ? because they don't need the capital. and as far as I understand these are not STOCKS this refers to BONDS.

On page 30 you can find this:

*Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.*

so everyone chill

# So why are people saying they missed their annual mark?

Good question young ape, normally at the end of the fiscal year a company makes a ""prospectus"" of what will be going on in the next year. meaning in simple words they ""guess"" how much the company will make in the next year.

But if you take into account that this was made pre covid, and pre knowing most of their stores would need to be closed they still did very well in my book.

They started to turn around the company mid pandemic, us apes started buying a lot at GME in February and still going strong, so the Q1 Earnings are going to be lit.

BUT WHY DID THE STOCK GO DOWN?

Relax my chimpy bro, a lot of people called that this would happen regardless of how the earnings would come out, because it all depends on how you look at the report, and well we by now have learned that the media sure as hell has an agenda.

&#x200B;

# So... this all doesn't sound great why are you still bullish?

Normally speaking when an earnings report they move the date as close to the weekend as they can, but for some reason they moved it up, moving it earlier in the week. and it was a meh report.

It wasn't great it wasn't bad. so why did they move it up?

Because I think we will see some surprise announcements.

Why do I think that? easy

Anyone who had listened in yesterday must have noticed how George Sherman fumbled about, he just read the earnings report and overlooking a lot of important stuff, had zero motivation and felt like he was reading his bad report card with zero interest.

He overlooked to say how the board is refreshing, how the company is planning on changing (important to mention when you bring out a meh report don't you think?), the expenses reduction.

it feels like the current CEO may be out soon. this is pure speculation on my part but I feel like this guy doesn't have long on the board.

You know why?

&#x200B;

# The board of directors.

lets take a look at the 10k filing again because a lot of people focused on the shares part but forgot about the other things in there of worth.

upcoming changes to who will stand for reelection to the board in June:

>Reference is made to the Current Report on Form 8-K that we filed with the SEC on January 11, 2021 that disclosed that on January 10, 2021, we entered into an agreement (the “Agreement”) with RC Ventures LLC and Ryan Cohen. This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aimé, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.** The contemplated retirements are not because of a disagreement with us on any matter relating to our operations, policies or practices.

**This change would leave only George Sherman and Kurt Wolf remaining from who was on the board prior to the deal with RC Ventures.**

That's like... nearly the entire of board directors. Current board

[https://news.gamestop.com/corporate-governance/highlights](https://news.gamestop.com/corporate-governance/highlights)

**George Sherman**

~~Jim Bell~~ <-- assuming he won't be on the board since he won't be CFO anymore

**Dan Reed** <--- don't know too much about him

~~Kathy Vrabeck~~ <-- current chair board

~~Carrie Teffner~~

~~Raul Fernandez~~

~~Lizabeth Dunn~~

~~William Simon~~

~~James Symancyk~~

~~Reginald Fils-Aimé~~

**Kurt Wolf** <-- was with Hestia Capital, one of the activist shareholders

~~Paul Evans~~

**Alan Attal** <-- Cohen's people

**Ryan Cohen** <--- obviously will stay on the board

**Jim Grube** <---- Cohen's people

Jenna Owens

Start noticing something here? because I do, this board is lining up to get all the boomers out and make this a fresh new board that knows what it's doing.

because of this I am expecting some ""surprise"" announcements in the coming weeks and who knows what is going to happen.

&#x200B;

**Addendum: this does not mean these people will leave, ""the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees"" this means there have not been a decision made on who will leave.**

So in short, what has changed?

Nothing, nothing at all.

The fact that the stock would go down was the easiest way of getting it down and it was to be expected, again expect fuckery all along the way.

These guys stand to lose everything, and they will try to wriggle their way out of it by making people paperhand.

if you look at the level 2 order book you can see that it's still all just algo trading.

Also Thank you  u/jamesroland17 who found out they shorted the **ENTIRE** Russel 2000.

EVERY ETF WITH GME got shorted yesterday.

This just reminds me of Frieza blowing up Namek just because he couldn't win, a hail Mary, a fuck it if I don't win no one wins.

This dude didn't sell a single god damn share, this dude has been right on his prediction all the way, don't you think that if he thought this was over he would've been out by now?

Nah because he knows just as well as we do that this is far from over.

# DTCC

so another smart ape did a great write up on the new filings, so it saves me a lot of time to write up my own version. go check it out here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc0zfn/too\_ape\_didnt\_read\_summary\_of\_srnscc2021801/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc0zfn/too_ape_didnt_read_summary_of_srnscc2021801/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

&#x200B;

# So what is the big take away from all of this?

Well GameStop knew we would be going through the Q4 Earnings report with a fine toothed Comb. They put the part of ""short squeezing"" in there for a reason, because even with disclosure they would've been fine with just shortly mentioning it.

The fact that they wrote out a full page saying ""hedgies R fuk"" should tell you smooth brains enough.

the fact that people can still expect ""volatility"" with it's stock right now due to this should tell you enough.

GME has literally said the short interest is OVER 100%

&#x200B;

Seriously this makes me more bullish then anything

So what has changed my apes?

nothing. nothing has changed, we do what we always do, get some nacho's get the dip and sit back and relax. the hedgies are digging their graves deeper and deeper and all we have to do is say thank you and relax.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

If anything happens throughout the day I will be adding it here.

Reevaluating senior board members

On page 17 of:[https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/55a92a3e-144e-4d2b-8ee6-930db9045593](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/55a92a3e-144e-4d2b-8ee6-930db9045593)

    Turnover in our senior management or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.
    
    Our success depends, in part, on the continuing services and contributions of 
    our leadership team to execute on our strategic plan and to identify and 
    pursue new opportunities. Through a committee of directors, our Board is
    currently evaluating our executive leadership team skill sets related to 
    meeting changing business requirements and has engaged a third party firm 
    to assist in its evaluation and exploration. 
    This evaluation and exploration could result in a change in one or more of 
    our senior executives. 
    
    Turnover in key leadership positions within the Company could adversely 
    affect our ability to manage the Company efficiently and effectively, 
    could be disruptive and distracting to management and may lead to 
    additional departures of current personnel, any of which could have a 
    material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
    
    Our success also depends, in part, upon our ability to attract, motivate 
    and retain a highly trained and engaged workforce, management for our stores 
    and skilled merchandising, marketing, financial and administrative personnel.
     
    In addition, the turnover rate in the retail industry is relatively high, 
    and there is an ongoing need to recruit and train new store associates. 
    Factors that affect our ability to maintain sufficient numbers of qualified
    associates include associate morale, our reputation, unemployment rates,
    competition from other employers and our ability to offer appropriate 
    compensation packages. 
    
    Any turnover in senior management in the future or inability to attract 
    and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on 
    our business and results of operations. 

In other words, an outsider will evaluate if the current ""senior management"" is fit for the task at hand.",2021-03-24 11:25:40

This is not possible without massive Hedge Fund short laddering. The price loss is not real.,1616641788.0,"*This is an opinion piece based on my own DD. I do not sit on the board of a hedge fund nor have I worked for one. This should be considered theoretical methodology in practice and not empirical absolution*

For those who are unfamiliar with short laddering, it’s when two bad faith actors (i.e. hedge funds) short and swap synthetic shares (fabricated shares that don’t really exist) at a loss, back and forth to create a downward trend in price. 

This is only done when shares of said stock are heavily shorted to generate retail panic selling to relieve the premium, or at best, even profit when they will eventually have to cover their short interest. 

When a stock price plummets on lower than expected volume, this is the most obvious indicator of a short ladder attack. This is likely what we are seeing in the last few days with GME. If the price drop were associated with high volume, this would be a real price drop indicator because the only way a stock price drops at this speed without this kind of artificial price suppression is when the selling pressure has increased by volume of sales exceeding the buys. That was not occurring with GME until the price suppression of the shorts triggered institutional stop losses, retail stop losses and paperhands selling off out of fear of loss. Some of that down price is artificially baked in. 

It’s a high risk play for hedge funds because they are banking on retail panic selling to realize the price drop in the real supply/demand economics. If the short ladder doesn’t sweep out retailers, all it does is tighten the coil on the launch of a short squeeze.

They are basically pulling a “fake it til you make it” strategy here. If everyone holds, the price will return and exceed the real demand price because synthetic shorting is a zero sum game if no one sells out of real shares, which they desperately need retailers to do for it to be effective. 

All we have to do is be Diamond Hand apes and this will not work. Don’t fall for their psychological tricks! Diamond Hand and the moon will be closer than we’ve ever seen it.

———

Edit 1: When I say almost no volume, I mean the volume relative to the price drop. If this were a real drop in price, the volume would be much greater than what we are seeing considering the strong buying sentiment today.

Edit 2: The volume picked up after I made this post making the title misleading but the point remains the same. There was only about 1M volume for two hours mid-day while the price continued to drop. Now sell volume has increased which is an indication of paperhands getting out in late afternoon.

Edit 3: Some of you are taking my “almost no volume” phrasing completely out of context.
First, the volume was around 11M when I posted this but spiked to 20M in the last couple of hours.
Second, 20M volume is less than half of the 44M daily avg for GME. (44M daily average according to Yahoo! Finance)
Third, price movement of this magnitude is extremely atypical for the RELATIVE low volume of the average day.

Edit 4: Some of you don’t like the term “short laddering” and prefer it be called “High Frequency Trading”. Call it whatever you want but the result is the same. Maybe we can call it HFF trading (Hedge Fund Fuckery trading).

Edit 5: For those who are questioning the “short ladder” method, I recommend going to this link and scrolling down to *The Anatomy of a Short Attack*.
I am not endorsing this as a verified source as I do not know the author, but rather an in-depth explanation of the method for those wanting to understand how this works.

Here is what I think: Prepare for a sweet Gamma Squeeze.,1615427753.0,"**I CAN'T STRESS THIS ENOUGH: READ THE EDITS!!! PEOPLE KEEP ASKING THE SAME QUESTIONS I ALREADY ANSWERED THERE.**

EDIT1: SOMEONE WANTS THIS SHIT TO MOON REALLY BAD AND LOADED UP ON OVER 30,000 - 60,000 ADDITIONAL OPTIONS BETWEEN $300 and $400, EXPIRING FRIDAY MARCH 12TH. (Updated 03/10, 7:35PM CET) That is an increase of another 20,000 Calls from just 10 Minutes ago!

**Edit2:** (UPDATED 03/10 7:37PM **CET**) Another 8,000 Calls @ 800 were bought within the last 5 minutes. That's just flexing at that point.

Edit3: I just refreshed the options page 3 times within a few seconds and there are more and more options coming in every second. Someone wants this to be much much bigger than we anticipated.

Edit4: I am gonna update all the numbers later. There is literally no point, because the call volume keeps increasing every few seconds at the moment.

Edit5: **Why did they do it today, and not tomorrow so the SSR rule is active for friday**? Because I think without this intervention, we would've mooned today if would've hit $350. But the Gamma Squeeze wouldn't have been as big as it will be now, because they loaded up on almost 100,000 more Call options. That's more than 10.000.000 Shares having to get bought, just by todays additional call volume. I think they wanted to make this moon even more all along and now this was the right (and last) moment, to prepare the biggest Gamma Squeeze ever.

Edit6: They actually used the same tactic 2 weeks ago and I found out about it beforehand: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lrijdv/my\_theory\_for\_todays\_market\_close\_get\_ready\_for\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lrijdv/my_theory_for_todays_market_close_get_ready_for_a/)

Edit7: **Just wanted to clarify: The Open Interest for Options get's updated EOD/TMRW**. Then we will see, how many new calls were added exactly. Volume is not 1:1 to OI, but seeing this huge spike in volume atm gives me reason to belive they added a shit ton of Calls. As I said: How many exactly, we will see tomorrow.

Edit 8: Why did news outlets get in on this so quick? They probably didn't think about it and just wanted to push the ""GME Squeeze is over 2.0"" narrative ASAP in order to help Shitadel & Friends and set off a huge panic sell.

&#x200B;

This might sound stupid or crazy, because I am just a crayon eating dipshit. But here is what I think just happend. No financial advice, just a theory, bla bla bla.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR** I think the Hedgefunds that want to fuck Shitadel & Friends just caused this drop by selling a large amount of shares, in order to trigger the SSR and to load up some shares and options with a lower base price / premium. (**Read the Edits above for more information! I answer most of the questions there!**)

&#x200B;

EDIT I: GME IS OFFICIALLY ON THE SSR FOR TODAY!

[https:\/\/ftp.nyxdata.com\/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers\/current\/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210310.xls](https://preview.redd.it/fqn6bg8zxcm61.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=018ed431ec61dd843c95a9ea78f5b103d9af7e66)

I. In order to trigger the SSR, the price had to drop to $222.21.

[NYSE just confirmed the SSR Trigger: https:\/\/ftp.nyxdata.com\/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers\/current\/NYSEGroupSSRCircuitBreakers20210310.xls](https://preview.redd.it/okc330ono8m61.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3bc51f125afd690cff295dcc60d13f1a82e2caa)

&#x200B;

II. The price rose steadily with more and more options becoming ITM. Before the real Gamma Squeeze starts, they want to make sure, that Shitadel & Friends can't short GME tomorrow.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

III. While GME dropped down to $172 (from $340, holy shit), almost all Stocks in my Portfolio went red and looked the same. I think that was someone liquidating assets, in order to load up on a lot more GME Shares and Options later today or tomorrow, so the Gamma Squeeze will be even bigger.

**Edit: (7:52PM CET)** Seems like a was right with this ""I think that was someone liquidating assets, in order to load up on a lot more GME Shares and Options later today or tomorrow, so the Gamma Squeeze will be even bigger.""

&#x200B;

IV.  I'll have to wait and look at the Open Interest and Volume for Options in the evening and tomorrow. But someone loaded up on a shit load of $800 Calls for this friday. There was a volume of 24,244 Calls and there is an open interest of about 22,000.

[ https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/options?p=GME ](https://preview.redd.it/4jba8v5ho8m61.png?width=882&format=png&auto=webp&s=327892ebc3a252ed9fe57ac76427ef717a8fb739)

**Edit2:** (UPDATED 03/10 7:37PM **CET**) Another 8,000 Calls @ 800 were bought within the last 5 minutes. That's just flexing at that point.

[ https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/options?p=GME ](https://preview.redd.it/swj8slplw8m61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=84a82d9233c6012afe86cc662cd7954455ecf475)

**EDIT3:** **SOMEONE WANTS THIS SHIT TO MOON REALLY BAD AND LOADED UP ON OVER 30,000 - 60,000 ADDITIONAL OPTIONS BETWEEN $300 and $400, EXPIRING FRIDAY MARCH 12TH**. (Updated 03/10, 7:35PM CET) That is an increase of another 20,000 Calls from just 10 Minutes ago!. This shit is about to explode tomorrow, because we were able to reach those prices without a Squeeze today! This confirms me in my theory, that someoneTM just watched and saw, that retail can be trusted. **(Updated 03/10, 7:35PM CET)**

Edit7: **Just wanted to clarify: The Open Interest for Options get's updated EOD/TMRW**. Then we will see, how many new calls were added exactly. Volume is not 1:1 to OI, but seeing this huge spike in volume atm gives me reason to belive they added a shit ton of Calls. As I said: How many exactly, we will see tomorrow.

[https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/quote\/GME\/options?p=GME](https://preview.redd.it/0mk6mzm4w8m61.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=4928b497c1e39ed49ec20666203a838727ae34af)

&#x200B;

V. Why trigger it now and not at opening? That's just pure speculation, but maybe they wanted to see, if people hold and buy the small dips today. People did and that gave them the cofirmation, that there won't be huge sell offs when this Rocket launches. (See picture @ point II); Also see edit5 @ top of the post.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**My theory of what is about to happen**: As I am writing this, the price currently sits at $205. **If it starts to rise really really fast again, we might just see the start of the Gamma Squeeze.** Trading will get halted multiple times, don't be scared! If you just bought this dip: Congratulations, future millionaire!

**Will it start today? I don't think so, but it's possible!** We **could** see a rise in price today and tomorrow GME will moon, because the SSR rule\* is in place. **I think we will close at about  $250 - $ 280 and tomorrow we'll go to the moon before the Short Squeeze.**

\*What is the SSR Rule?  The short-sale rule or SSR, is also known as the alternative uptick rule or SEC rule 201. The SSR restricts short-sales on a stock that has declined in price by 10 percent or more from the previous day's close. Once triggered, the SSR remains in effect until the end of the following trading day. That means they can only short on upticks. But not on downticks. What happens when they short on upticks? Nothing. They did that the last few days, the price dropped $10 - $15 and immediatly recovered a few minutes after. People also bought every dip, making it look like there is no way out for Shitadel & Friends now.

I WILL KEEP THIS POST UP TO DATE AS I AM COLLECTING MORE DATA AT THE MOMENT. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANTED TO KNOW WHAT JUST HAPPEND.",2021-03-10 18:55:53
61,YOU SEE IT APE NATION!!! Viva Las Vegas!!!,1621622213.0,,2021-05-21 11:36:53,"True value - an open letter from Billy Markus, co-founder and original creator of Dogecoin",1612845352.0,"Hi folks! I can't believe this place is over a million members now - back when I was active we had less than 10% of this! So I'd like to introduce myself to many new folks - I am Billy Markus, the original creator of Dogecoin. As you may have heard, it was indeed created for sillies after Jackson Palmer made an flippant tweet about it that idea being the 'next big thing' and I threw it together, without any expectation or plan. It took about 3 hours to make, with the bulk of that time making alterations to the client to make the text Comic Sans and some custom graphics and wording for different pieces of the UI.

As I mentioned on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/BillyM2k/status/1355694247526035458), I'm no longer part of the Dogecoin project, I left around 2015 as the community started to strongly shift from one that I was comfortable with. I don't currently own any Dogecoin except what has been tipped to me recently, I gave away and/or sold all the crypto I had back in 2015 after being laid off and scared about my dwindling savings at the time, for about enough in total to buy a used Honda Civic. I'm not struggling - I work full time as a Software Engineer - but I'm mentioning this to set the record straight, as there are many incorrect assumptions around about my involvement and stake in the project.

So if I'm not involved in Dogecoin, why did I want to post? I wanted to give a little perspective and history for some of the founding principles of Dogecoin, for anyone who was willing to listen.

**Dogecoin message**

With the recent Dogecoin mania going on, my inbox was being flooded by people demanding me to do things for them so they would become richer. This was a bit jarring for the reasons I mentioned above - and while I am sympathetic to those struggling and understand how emotional and important money can be, especially right now with this pandemic, I couldn't help feeling pretty down about it. My mom is currently struggling to make her home payments and will likely lose her house, and if I hadn't ""messed up"" my crypto investments years ago, I would be able to comfortably help her.

But I did receive some encouraging words and a few small tips - and honestly, that did help take the sting off everything and elevate my mood. And more relevantly, it reminded me of one of the original messages of Dogecoin - one of unexpected generosity. I'll explain that message with a story.

**""Save Dogemas""**

The first few weeks after Dogecoin was released was incredibly fast moving, and I think I would succinctly describe it as ""complete utter insanity."" It went from a silly joke to something worth something to people very quickly, and a community was developing fast, with lots of shady people and lots of new people, quickly putting up services and infrastructure around it.

One of those things was an online wallet - instead of having to download the clunky and slow main client where you have to download the whole blockchain, someone had provided a service to hold people's Dogecoin for them. Online wallets in the history of cryptocurrency have a history of being sketchy, however, and sure enough, on Christmas, the wallet was hacked, and 21 million Dogecoins were stolen in the process.

This type of story was all too common in cryptocurrency world, but what happened next was not. Some members of the community got together and started a Dogecoin fund to ""Save Dogemas"" - to try to return money to those who had lost it, and the community - to my great surprise - was willing to help. The Dogecoin community donated millions of coins to help those who had been victims of the bad actor - and that spirit didn't stop, the community would donate Dogecoins for both good causes, such as helping build [water wells in Africa](https://www.coindesk.com/dogecoin-foundation-raise-50k-kenya-water-crisis), [helping connect service dogs and kids](https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/4/5377984/dogecoin-community-raises-money-to-send-service-dogs-to-kids), and silly and amusing causes, such as helping [send the Jamaican Bobsled team to the Olympics](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/20/jamaican-bobsled-team-raises-dogecoin-winter-olympics), or [sponsoring a Nascar driver](https://www.cnn.com/2014/04/24/tech/web/nascar-dogecoin-talladega/index.html).

**True Value**

People are talking about Dogecoin going to $1 - that would make the ""market cap"" larger than actual companies that provide services to millions, such as Boeing, Starbucks, American Express, IBM. Does Dogecoin deserve that? That is not something I can comprehend, let alone answer.

Again, I have no real say in this, and everyone has the right to value the coin in any way they wish - it is just my wish, as the original creator, **that Dogecoin and the Dogecoin community can be a force for good**. And I don't mean that in some sanctimonious way where the only thing of value is giving to charity or directly helping others - anything that is amusing or fun has value as well. The fiat value of Dogecoin is quite literally whatever someone else is willing to pay for it at any point in time, and the intrinsic value is not something I will ever be able to define, so when I talk about value, I'm not talking about those things. I'm talking about ""True Value"", which I'd define as the positive things Dogecoin brings to the world.

Pump and dumping, rampant greed, scamming, bad faith actors, demanding from others, hype without research, taking advantage of others - those are all worthless. Worse than worthless, honestly, bringing more negativity to an already difficult world. As the creator, some have called me the ""doge mother"" so I say this with that mask - when I see things like that - and I've seen plenty of it through the last 7 years - I'm not mad, just disappointed.

Joy, kindness, learning, giving, empathy, fun, community, inspiration, creativity, generosity, silliness, absurdity. These types of things are what makes Dogecoin worthwhile to me. **If the community embodies these things, that's True Value.**

If you read this far, I appreciate it. Keep educating yourself as much as you can on how cryptocurrency works, how these markets work, never risk more than you could safely lose, be vigilant and aware.

# SEC Meeting

Yesterday the SEC had a closed door meeting, now in and of itself that is not weird, as far as I know this happens once a month anyway.

What got spoken of in there is an entirely different matter.

u/Conscious-Sea-5937 was kind enough to do a dive into the minutes of the meeting.

as can be seen [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mdegxq/re_sec_closed_meeting_today_3252021/)

The main take-aways for me in this entire thing are thankfully easy:

1. this will most likely result in a criminal lawsuit, meaning it will be more than just a simple ""slap on the wrist"" they normally receive.
2. Confidential informant protection, this means someone is most likely stepping up and they need to make sure they are protected properly (together with the Whistleblower's payment going up recently, it may mean someone has already stepped up)
3. to me this all reads as if someone is about to be pinched.
4. granted this could all be a coincidence that these specific things are being discussed now, but the timing is just to perfect for me personally.

but isn't it nice that at the same time Jpow has ended the Fed's infinite money glitch for banks this comes out:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vuac9yiajcp61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=08004dd55b953b56879d701c9335d241f553fd6c

It seems that the inf-money glitch has been patched out and they banked on it to continue, now that it doesn't they are up against a wall.... hmmmm 🤔

so take away is;

Bank got inf money for Covid (so they wouldn't fall), Fed says nah we financially in the clear now, SEC says lol we done with your shit and then the 31st of march happens to be the last day they can lend.... not sure what will happen when that glitch of theirs ends but it's going to be a spectacle to say the least.

# Save the whales

Ok lets do this thing \*cracks knuckles like a geriatric\*

As a lot of people have been posting about the long whales and why they wouldn't pull out.

u/beowulf77 the oracle of Wuz, did a great deep dive into one of the biggest whales,  **Blackrock/Vanguard.**

[found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md89wg/king_kong_magnum_opus_dd_posted_on_behalf_of_wuz/)

It gives a bit of background as to who they are, and I would advise you to read it in full.

But to give a quick overview lets make this a bit easier to digest, like tendies.

To reform a board RC wouldn't have enough power on his own to kick people out on his own, but you know who would? RC AND Blackrock. RC has a long background with them as Blackrock where the guys who backed RC with Chewy and made sure he had the capital to begin doing what he believed in.

To reform a company you need 2 things: voting share majority and a kickass CEO.

Now while RC himself can't START the proceedings to get his preferred members instated (as we have seen in yesterdays daily he needs to stay below 19.9% shares) and he can't start picking a board until 2022.

But you know who can? Blackrock, because they don't have any contract in place, they just own a lot of shares, so even though they didn't vote last year, there may have been a good reason for them to do so, because by how it looks right now they are the ones making the plays for RC so that this company didn't have to deal with a corrupt board (shown by the CFO's shot at trying to oust RC when he got in).

So TLDR, why wouldn't the whales cash out? because they see a future brighter than we can all see right now, they're most likely in close contact with RC and know his plans, they have backed him for years so why would they suddenly flip?

# The Glitch of 290 Million in GME Matrix!

&#x200B;

For over 3 days in a row we have been seeing some weird ""glitch"" on the books, with huge volumes which are multiple times the available (total) float.

The thing is people keep pinging me and asking my opinion, but I lack the technical knowledge to say this is either a bug created because they still run things on windows XP or that it's a technical indicator so I'm pinging u/wardenelite and hope he could perhaps explain this, I will also be asking mr Kelleher about this if he would perhaps know anything about this or know how we could explain this.

Because a glitch once is just a glitch, a glitch happening consecutively day after day... that is usually not a glitch.

also this ties together with:

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

# WardenElite getting hate.

Ok so yesterday u/wardenelite was kind enough to stream and explain a lot of stuff , but once he was asked about the probability of it reaching 100k or higher he  he believes its more probable the closer we get to it . and because of that immediately people started popping off and saying both u/heyitspixel u/wardenelite and I where compromised.

so thanks for that I guess?

# Q4 Earnings report.

After today's close we will finally get the Q4 earnings report.

People do need to keep in mind this is the last 3 months of last year, this will not include this years numbers at all.

In the Q4 last year RC did publicly stated that he owned a stake in GME but keep in mind the ""hype"" surrounding GME only started at around the end of January, also he was appointed in Q1 2021.

Does this mean the earnings report will be bad? no but it is lagging behind for 3 months, so we wont see the affect of the ""GME Movement"" untill the Q1 earnings.

This isn't me trying to piss in your coffee this is being realistic, nothing more.

Now that being said:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xei1zjf62ro61.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cba09f7e1f7344e10dd8137f45967369e99e727

So going off of these metrics we are currently sitting at 2.8 p/s, and it seems to be semi stable at this point, so this is kindof what I expect from the earnings call/ the meeting afterward ( 5pm EDT here: [GameStop Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Call](https://viavid.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1424794&tp_key=d5ec83cadf))

If you have been paying attention you might have seen some already positive articles saying the earnings will be great, this is another opportunity of for fud. and you may think... Rensole if it's positive why is it fud?

Because its something you'll see in polls is doing well,  but suddenly it gets crashed and it's worse than before, the same goes the other way. this comes down to overperforming or underperforming. so don't worry if this is a catalyst it will happen. remember we don't do dates so nothing has changed.

With the meeting expect they'll announce anything, a partnership with new companies, appointing new members to the board, a roadmap of the company where it will go and how it will do so, etc etc.

Buy the dip, hold and go eat some tendies

&#x200B;

**Addendum: it seems GME has a Q4 that seems to be November-December-January, so this does change it a bit.**

# Transfering

I honestly thought everyone here would at minimum contact their own brokers before doing anything. seeing that most of you dont here is a rundown.

If you TRANSFER your stocks TO ANOTHER broker, until they HIT that broker you CANNOT trade them.

This is why you've seen Shills trolling about transferring from one broker to another.

Here is a voice call confirming this

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Also because people kept asking for my BTC I've made one and put the thingy in my profile.

&#x200B;

Also for the people complaining, I've been doing this fulltime for close to two months, I've taken a lot of my own free time and earned nothing because I've been putting all my time into this.

So before you start complaining realize that I'm doing this voluntarily, and it's costing me money daily, yet I am still doing it.

also The next guy threatening me, or harassing me or anyone else gets an instaban, I'm done taking shit for helping people out.

Edit 2:

Because some people dont understand what Statistical probability is, GOOGLE!

I personally believe in the squeeze and I'm sure of what will happen, I know there will be a squeeze, be it FTD squeeze or moass.

I'm not saying 1k is the top at all I'm saying statistically speaking a price movement closer to the current price is more likely than a movement to 500x what it is, it has nothing to do with what I believe the max price will be it has to do with Statistical probability.

the chance of you getting 10 bucks from a friend is statistically higher than 11 bucks, as is 10 bucks more likely than a 100.

The more the number go's out the less statistical probability it has to happen from a pure mathematical standpoint.

Again Statistical analysis is just PART of everything there are hundreds of variables in this, and statistics wont be the only indicator, otherwise we'd know what the end price would be and we would have a hard price saying X will be the amount.

Seriously if you think this is me undermining any price you never had any form of statistics and I'd advise looking it up and seeing what statistical analysis is and how it works.

# New Rules set for publication 3/24

u/ReBjorn65 just wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mbgn48/nssc002_and_nssc801_update/)

I did not see a new post yet on this.

The rules for NSCC-002 and NSCC-801 that were filed by the SEC on 3/18 just got updated on the Federal Register this morning. They are set for publication tomorrow 3/24.

This will allow the DTCC to activate them. (From what I understand)

Earnings are out =D

[https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2020-results](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2020-results)

**Addendum:**

George Sherman just basicly read the earnings, did not offer a future roadmap, did not offer any form of leadership on how they're shifting the company to be an Omnichannel company.

What he did underplay was the hiring of Neda Pacifico, Kelli Durkin, Ryan Cohen and their expertise With Chewy and what these new hires can do. let's just say ""current"" Ceo does not know his crowd.

And also Jenna Owens, 

Ms. Owens brings approximately two decades of technology, operations, fulfillment, and supply chain experience to GameStop. Most recently, she was Director and General Manager for Distribution and Multi-Channel Fulfillment at Amazon. She previously held senior operations roles at Google and Honeywell. At GameStop, Ms. Owens will be responsible for overseeing functions that include business intelligence, fulfillment, supply chain, and store operations. 

Overall the earnings was quite neutral (not extremely good or bad imo), given the fact that a prognosis of the company's 2020 fiscal year was made in 2019, pre pandemic, and it still did well enough to not have a bad earnings report is impressive.

&#x200B;

Also if people see the AH go crazy, take a look at the level 2 data, it's algo trading.

&#x200B;

Also DFV did not sell a single thing, he's still in, I'm still in

It's like SOME of you don't even want the squeeze to happen. Weird.

Edit2:
Wow, #2 on my favorite subreddit. I am a warm and fuzzy ape. Thanks for the awards!

I wanted to clarify something I posted in my first edit about beta value. First type in negative beta in google and you get this:

""A negative beta correlation means an investment moves in the opposite direction from the stock market. When the market rises, a negative-beta investment generally falls. When the market falls, the negative-beta investment will tend to rise.""

[Here is some DD about GME's beta value from 2 weeks ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/m6g8u4/extremely_abnormal_negative_beta_of_gme_evidence/) Long story short GME's beta was -2.07 on 03/17 and I got the same value when I looked for it just now. What it means to me is that when GME goes BRRRRRRRR market goes GUHHHHH. Smarter apes can explain the deeper mechanics and nuance but that is it in a nutshell.

# Q4 Earnings report.

Ok so I've been getting a lot of messages regarding what I expect of the Q4 earnings report.

A few things to keep in mind for this:

Due to the pandemic a lot more people have been staying inside and gaming more than usual.

Nintendo reported to have had a record breaking sales year [seen here](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html)

RC only stated his investment of GME around November and only stepped into a official capacity in January (Jan 10th as I believe).

So the true echo of this entire thing will be noticeable in the Q1 Earnings report, even so I expect the Q4 Earnings to be positive, but by  looking at everything going on I believe that we wont see the true extent until the Q1 and Q2 2021 earnings reports.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mcmiddl7sjo61.jpg?width=596&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f9c4f6bcea3b3681019fb33f00df82fdde0c4f2

# Wen Ceo?

Ok so what I have noticed is that usually (again purely from what I've seen) A new CEO will be appointed after the Quarterly earnings report, if RC won't be called in as CEO directly, relax it's not always a direct line, right now he is focusing on making the inside of GME healthy again.

And that means he can become CEO in the next week, but it may just as well be within the next six months, for example he can do it by June with the international shareholder meeting.

Remember we have no clock, there is no sense of urgency.

it will come when it comes

Also going by the information [of this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mafvpz/jim_bell_was_not_the_only/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

it seems that the board(george Sherman) and 3 of his cronies (Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez and Kathy Vrabeck) tried to keep Cohen out, why? well if they where in cahoots with Melvin or Citadel then it would be in their best interest to keep Ryan and his new team out as much as they can.

Funny enough on all their slips (seen in the screenshots in that post) Jim Bell (now EX CFO) was the lawyer for all three of these people.

# To Squeeze or not to Squeeze,

Ok so this is the most found Fud I've seem to come across so let's nip this in the butt as much as we can.

""GmE WoNt SqUeZe GeT 0Ut""

Bullshit, listen at this point it's easy, it doesn't matter if it squeezes or not, if you look at how GME is transforming itself right now it is still a solid investment in my opinion as the company's worth is not yet reflected in it's price.

How am I so sure? as this stock is currently still very manipulated and it's still at around the 200 mark, so I see this stock on it's own (sans squeeze) hover between the 500 to 1000 mark (depending on how well they transform the company, but with RC at the helm I see this going to a 1000 minimum).

""We OwN ThE Fl0aT""

We dont, not yet.

If we owned the entire float it would be impossible for us to buy any shares.

So if you look at the fact that we can still buy them, I know because I was able to get 10 more on friday, it means there is still float available.

""BuT ThEy ArE SyNtHetic""

Don't mean shit, if you bought them, they're yours, it's your bank/broker/dealer (sup Tyrone) job to give you real ones, if they end up being synthetic (which in and of themselves would be weird as melvin and shitadel need those for shorting) then you can still sell them later on for the same worth as the real ones.

# The Fuddering

Alright let's post some funny stuff people have found over the weekend, related to fud, Vlad the stock Impaler's company.

&#x200B;

Not sure if real or not but seems like something they'd do, as remember they have everything to lose, if I was in their position I would do everything I could.

Because if they can FUD out enough people they may be able to survive, and the fines they receive are a slap on the wrist at worst. remember they view fines just as ""the cost of doing business"".

# Gme earnings conference call

Be sure to register beforehand, because we will most likely ""force choke"" their ISP by just wanting to be informed. Seriously GME I'm already sorry for the amount of internet traffic this will get.

if you can't connect to it don't worry I'll be tuning in and I will be taking notes throughout.

# The Yearly Shareholders meeting.

So a smart ape u/zakataha found this:

[2020](https://preview.redd.it/yqi8yqceyjo61.png?width=294&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6732c4b5fd889bb307faa8a8b983aa085278c9)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9enm6/i\_believe\_that\_the\_next\_annual\_date\_is\_june\_10/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9enm6/i_believe_that_the_next_annual_date_is_june_10/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

&#x200B;

So this may also be why we have not yet seen a recall on GME's end. Due to Texas law you can at max ask for 60 days before the meeting for the shares to be recalled. so at the earliest expect mid April for this.

The thing is that we've also read that Blackrock has a big portion but didn't recall their shares as they didn't care enough to vote, but this was a previous year and it was a very different scenario. due to everything happening it could be that GME themselves recall the shares due to expectation of fraud.

**Addendum:** I've also read some people post ""oh but they outweigh RC so he wont get voted in"", to those people I'd like to say, WELCOME TO CORPERATE LIFE!

He can get either voted in (which is very likely Imo) OR he could just buy more shares and do a hostile takeover, one way or another, if he man wants that seat he'll get it as he's got the money to do a Hostile takeover but I think giving the current BOD this shouldn't be a problem.

Also (please prove me wrong with this) I've been looking into the current CEO George Sherman, and I've not seen him post, or offer any comments on the current situation what so ever, which is weird to say the least.

Now being in a publicly traded company does bring along certain limits, you can't just say what you want against short sellers, because people know it could hurt their company, so they'd rather keep their head down and go through the storm.

# Fuddruckers?

Now it has been quiet in the past weekend to my knowledge, I've been offline for 99% of the time but still. it seems that they're trying what I speculated last week and the week before.

Get the members who are doing their best to help the community and either get them banned or get them discredited.

[Welp here we go](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/maikv1/after_my_ban_was_revoked_hedgies_are_trying_to/)

I'm not saying that the people who are doing this are bot's shills or trolls, I'm just saying stay vigilant against all forms of FUD.

People have noticed that both RC and DFV are following Elon, this may be because of a simple reason, he's a funny guy? also Elon has expressed interest in adding gaming in his cars for quite some while now (I believe this originated at around 2018/2019).

But what's interesting is this:

[https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253258/tesla-model-s-ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-10-teraflop)

It could be that Tesla is going to add in some form of gaming in their cars, and given the fact that GME is currently actively looking to extend their business in all different types and forms, so this does not confirm anything, it's just nice to see the link and who knows, we may see a tesla with built in gaming rigs for long drives or charging sessions.

# Most of you are helping Citadel without knowing it.

As stated in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mai4pe/most_of_you_are_helping_the_gme_shorts_and_you/) there are a lot of people helping Citadel without knowing it.Check your broker in that post, check your settings and be sure to set everything correctly.

We have also seen a lot of post stating that if you use OPTIONS, there is a huge chance that you're helping the other side, because who writes these options? and who do they work with?

# DFV has spoken

Ok for the people who don't know this here is Michael Jacksin, the KING of POP!

the songs he performed there:

* ""Jam"" (includes beginning of ""Why You Wanna Trip On Me"")
* ""Billie Jean""
* ""Black or White""
* ""We Are the World"" (children's choir)
* ""Heal the World""

Interesting thing about MJ, this was his glove:

# ETF's

So as some people may have known, last friday the ETF's rebalanced, this means that the stocks they have inside of them changed. now I have not seen how many ETF's have dropped GME or how many have held on, if anyone has any type of analysis on this subject please let me know.

&#x200B;

Now the most important part of everything

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9246r62l3ko61.jpg?width=554&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ae3774db5d532625e132910d0b553d9024670b1

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Someone was awesome enough to map the ETF's new amount of GME in etf's.

it seems that currently there are 15,846,731 shares stuck in the ETF's.

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

&#x200B;

# Because some people can't properly read let me state it here, the fact that I Think GME is a good company regardless of a squeeze DOES NOT MEAN I NO LONGER BELIEVE IN THE SQUEEZE!.

# !!!I STILL BELIEVE THE SQUEEZE WILL HAPPEN!!!

# I believe a squeeze is inevitable at this point, but looking at the fundamentals it's a good company.

# it's also currently very undervalued in my opinion

# not financial advice.

&#x200B;

Edit 3:

Also what I might want to add is that it may be a good idea to contact your brokers, and ask them to recall your shares and tell them not to lend them out until you want them to.

# Hey Call me maybe.

So the last Friday we saw some huge block trades take place.

    Goldman Sachs Group Inc. liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades 
    on Friday, part of an extraordinary spree of selling that erased $35 billion 
    from the values of bellwether stocks ranging from Chinese technology giants 
    to U.S. media conglomerates.

we dont know as of right now what caused this, what we do know is who,   Tiger Cub Archegos Capital Management LLC .

Archegos is a hedgefund, it could be that they where over leveraged and got margin called, but because we don't have access to their books this remains speculation. we also don't know for sure if this had anything to do with GME, this may also be as of a result of the Suez Canal being blocked.

We just don't know right now.

This statement however does give me food for thought as this can mean some more stuff like this can happen but it could be just their MO that they decline comments on things like this.

Some more details on who Archegos are, and whats going on I'd say check [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mesrdk/archegos_capital_is_a_hedge_fund_that_is/) by u/electricp0ww0w it goes into some detail on who they are and what may be up.

# Shitadel hiring freeze.

As u/worried-yogurt-4204 wrote [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/meoqgw/citadel_headed_toward_hiring_freeze_deep_dive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Citadel is apparently in the midst of a hiring freeze.

Tldr of it is simple, Citadel has the highest turnover rate of all the major hedgefunds, this is not a big thing in and of itself because these companies are brutal, you either make the cut or you don't no second chances etc.

but they are terminated almost a full year before their competitors which is high, plus taking into account that citadel hires are normally of a cyclical nature (hires in June, and terminations look to be around August) but this year it seems to be different, for the first time in years they currently aren't hiring.

If they where still a healthy company they would be hiring, they would be looking at the future and thinking to themselves, we need people for the next season.

Also Kenny gave an interview to the Financial Times [here](https://archive.is/0AdPT)

This is showing me that he wants to create a narrative in which retail and ""stimmy inflation"" is to be blamed for the inevitable crash caused by them.

even going as far as to say (and I quote)

""Griffin highlighted how an oblique [tweet of a McDonald’s ice cream cone](https://archive.is/o/0AdPT/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-gamestop-idUSKBN2AO2SP) and a frog emoji from Ryan Cohen, a big GameStop shareholder, appeared to be the spark for a doubling of the stock’s price in one afternoon in February.""

People I get it, you're excited for the endgame, but want to know a little secret?

We wont know when the endgame is until it is over. we can keep saying ""oh its endgame now"" or it's in a week or a month.

We don't know what the price ends up being, we don't know what the timeframe will be. it can be today tomorrow or a month from now, all we know is that at some point the bubble goes pop. we don't know when or where.

&#x200B;

# Si is upwards of 2000% ?

ok take this one with a hug ass canon of salt, the guy did a great job of writing it up but seeing we are constantly being fed bad data, this means that any research coming from this may be skewed, the SI could be more, it could be less.

Regardless I think it should be looked at.

# Big numbers in TOS

ok so first of all check [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mf1f6n/i_was_missing_a_key_piece_of_the_puzzel_this_is/)

the post goes into:

1. Why we see huge “volume” pop up on TD TOS for GME
2. Why we see huge “volume” pop up on TD TOS for other stocks
3. Why we see it in the “volume” column with no buy/sell orders lodged against it
4. Why this “volume” **can’t** be used to calculate short interest, potential prices or whatever other

&#x200B;

# Things to keep in mind

Right now this entire thing is just psychological, and you may think to yourself ok.. what?

let me explain, we have seen people say,

**- They control the price**

Lol no this is spiraling more and more out of control

**- They can do anything**

At some point they'll have to pay the piper

**- We own the float**

Smart way to get people to stop buying, we stop buying then the buying pressure falls, meaning they can short it back down and done. remember they where never planning on covering their shorts, the only way they can win is if this GME=0 and this is impossible now

**- This is taking to long**

People... seriously have you never worked for something? it takes time patience and effort to change things, this shit wont come overnight and it wont come easy.

&#x200B;

So for the love of god chill the fuck out, you see some low level fud, ignore it.

you see someone who wants to rattle you, just think why would he?

If you see someone say ""I think it will go max $500"" let them think that, why ? because if you believe the price will go to 1k, or 100k, you wait till that point. if someone else doesn't agree on price with you it can be for a variety of reasons, but the main one is simple, why do you care when someone else values their stock in a different way? and why should you? I don't

EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

it seems that there is a possibility that shorts can be hidden in far out OTM calls, now I can't and wont tell you what to do, but if you use option please be aware you may be helping hedgies.

Some of you may know my username from memes. Sometimes I overdose on crayons and throw up a colorful DD. Some people think I'm crazy because I've posted some kinda out there theories (I stand by every one of them). But I'm just doing my thing, posting about GME in a few main stock subs since January. Cruising around reddit being a trippy lil pink cat 🐈🍄💕 

In the last couple of weeks I feel the tides have changed on the battlefront. Obvious paid shill accounts with the ol' adjective-noun-number format in their username started commenting way more hateful, personal stuff on my posts. All kinds of messages that seemed like they were meant to be not too aggressive, but make me paranoid none the less. After I made a few seemingly big connections in my recent posts, my account was reported for self harm. (I am a perfectly happy and content lil kitty, don't worry 🙂). Things started getting a little spooky. I also got over [100](http://imgur.com/a/02FrYiS) new followers just after posting that same OP. (I'm not going to link it here because that's not what this post is about.) 

**Did you hear me?!** *Over 100 new followers in like a 2 hour time frame. After a post that got like 30 upvotes and some Q comments.* 

Which brings me to why I'm posting this now. I was approached yesterday by a brand new reddit account to *Get paid to write posts/DDs/memes in our stock subs, but only about certain (just 3 or 4 apparently!!!) NASDAQ/NYSE/OTC/EURO companies. NOT GME* 

I scheduled a phone interview yesterday afternoon because... y'know... curiosity killed the cat. And of course I (legally) documented it. I am not implying the company itself is malicious, that's not for me to decide, therefore I will not be sharing it here. I have thrown it into the void of the SEC and my local reps, along with all the other things I've shared with them. Not as a whistle-blower, because my evidence doesn't necessarily prove (or disprove) anything directly. 

But it sure jacked my tits in the confirmation bias dept. 

As I said, I'm not going into detail about what was discussed. But I would be paid to post DD and other content about a certain assigned company or stock and essentially, it seemed to me, to ""pump"" that stock in our beloved subs (ok I can actually prove that with the offer itself). It is in fact a real media company making this offer. I think they are paid to come to us top posters and try to ~~bribe~~ distract us away from talking about GME. The woman I talked to was just a rep that knew nothing of reddit or how it works, but she said their ""expert team of social media analysts familiar with reddit has been watching me and chose to approach me.""🤷‍♀️(Please don't out yourself here if you're among us ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ as I've tried very hard to avoid calling anyone out or accuse of anything directly.)

I did not give them my real name. They got a burner phone number to [contact me](http://imgur.com/a/itcxxer). I actually requested they just call me Pink for the phone call 🤭👑 

**I want you to know I'm certainly not taking the offer.** I am not going to be paid to blow up this sub with posts about other stocks besides my precious GME. Like, I literally don't care about them. And nothing will ever pay me enough to mislead or distract my fellow apes. There is no other situation like GME, we all know that. I just got enough information from them to validate that this is a very legit offer, and now I have it. It's my own confirmation bias that all of this is legit, it's not just in our heads.  

GME has already changed my life. This community is literally like family even though I don't know a single 1 of you apes. I want to help, I want to support, I want to educate, I want to boost morale. Paying me to spam distractions during such a critical time?

Your downvote bots didn't work. 

Your hateful, personal comment attacks didn't work. 

Your onslaught of sudden followers didn't work. 

Your paranoia inducing messages didn't work. 

Your self harm report didn't work.

I should also note that their company clients can directly choose my reddit profile and my ""expertise/reddit presence"" and hire me from a list of these ""influencers"".

~~Ladies and gentleapes, let me introduce you to this journalist at MarketWatch, published an article at~~ **~~11:55 a.m. EST,~~** ~~yet the price drop occured well after.~~

\*\***EDIT:**\*\*  It's been brought to my attention that E\*trade's app was experiencing a glitch and posted the article's time incorrectly. This can also be true. No comment from E\*Trade or MW has been released yet.

**EDIT 2:** [MrDavidNio](https://twitter.com/mrdavidnio) posted the [tweet](https://twitter.com/MrDavidNIO/status/1369733681259053061) originally.

According to E\*trade's app, the article publish time reflects **11:55 a.m. EST**, but when we [visit the article now](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-was-reaching-new-heights-but-shares-in-the-meme-stocks-just-plummeted-11615398208), it shows **12:43 p.m. ET**.

\* **EDIT 3:**\* It's been brought to my attention that E\*trade and other brokerage apps were displaying the incorrect timestamp. Hence the article's timestamp was an hour off and displaying the time as 1 hour before (11:55am instead of 12:55pm).

&#x200B;

A Twitter user [posted this](https://twitter.com/dave_jupiter/status/1369897260553822208): he saw the same article from MarketWatch posted on the WeBull app (WeBull doesn't write the articles, of course). So he reached out to WeBull, expressing his concerns about the timing of the article.

**Check out WeBull's response about the timing of the article:**

**\*Disclaimer:** I can't confirm the accuracy of this message from WeBull customer service (unless I speak to WeBull directly). However, I saw it posted around Twitter and thought I'd share.

**TL;DR:** Expect even more f\*ckery today and in the days to come, esp when it's time to moon. Many held down to $39, and our diamond-balls apes held all the way down from $487. They can't shake me or break me. Drive it down to $0.99, I'll buy more.

**Obligatory:** Not financial advice. I'm a dumb money retail gambler. I don't know Jack Schitt.

If anyone would like to add to this or if I've made any errors, please let me know and I'll correct.

**EDIT 1**: Some images are not loading for some reason. Let me know if you're unable to see.

**EDIT 2:** Whoa! Thank you for all the comments and love. Many apes have provided more info and I'm trying my best to go through hundreds of comments. Reddit desktop is running extremely slow for me and the app keeps freezing on me. Will update as soon as I can.

**EDIT 3:** Please please do not harass any of the journalists on their social media accounts. I understand it's upsetting, but we are FAR better than that. We don't need to stoop to the f\*ckery level. Screenshots were provided for informational purposes only.

**Edit 4:** I've been receiving a ton of msgs about the date of the MW article showing on Google 14hrs prior to the price dip. Yes, I noticed this yesterday and here's why I didn't find it necessary to post:

An article sitting as a draft can be discovered by Google's bots prior to publishing- this is called **indexing.** Additionally, the URL or title of the article can also be changed at a later time.

So the question many are asking: ""Why would an article about GME's price decline even be sitting as a draft, many hours prior to it actually happening?""

Often, journalists working for large publications draft up an article early on so when/if the news breaks, they can publish it quickly.

Here's my **personal take** on this specific situation (and I'm not asking anyone to agree with me): $GME has been on a [ride upwards since 2/24/21](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME), with the exception of a couple dates (2/26, 3/02) where the stock price closed just a few dollars lower than the previous day's close. Yet, the day the price takes a 40% dive (and rallies right back up- ayeee!!), suddenly articles are published super quickly. Now, I get it- it's completely possible for someone with dope ass skills to publish an article within minutes, all while microwaving chicken. Nonetheless, I still find it sus.

**Edit 5:** In relation to the screenshots I've posted here- tons of people **claimed** yesterday to have seen the article before the price dipped, and so they posted their observations on Twitter and r/GME. I get it, it's not proof, just statements.

Do with this information what you will.

**My Thoughts:** Do I think media manipulation exists? F\*ck yes. Do I think media is currently being manipulated re: GME, regardless of if these journalists in question had insider info about the price drop or not? F\*ck yes.

It's blatantly obvious. These are so-called financial experts who cover the stock market every damn day, and have public information about GME easily available to them, plus a shit ton of other tools/resources, yet they deliberately choose to disregard GME's fundamentals.

Remember, there are BILLIONS, likely trillions, of dollars on the line here. The media isn't your friend, they're on the HF's payroll to spread FUD. This isn't anything new. We should know by now how Jim Cramer manipulated the market and used the media to cause panic. [He said it HIMSELF.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DJlogbrDcA)

**For you lazy apes, here are some of JC's statements directly from the video:**

""Mechanics are more important than the fundamentals....Who cares about the fundamentals!""

Oh, this one is my fav:

""I think it's important for people to recognize that the way that the market really works is to have that nexus of hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders that can push it down (stock price), **then leak it to the press and then get it on CNBC, that's also very important. And then you have a kind of vicious cycle down.""**

Mind you, he works as a host for that exact news channel CNBC, offering ""expert financial advice"" to millions of people.

**FYI:** The YT video of him admitting to [market manipulation is constantly removed](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/history-jim-cramer-thestreetcom-founder-mad-money-host/) by JC's team. The video was reposted recently on 2/3/21, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's removed again.

Want more? [Here's another article](https://www.reuters.com/article/cramer-interview-idUKN2036292620070320) from 2007 talking about getting ""bozo reporters"" and feeding them wrong information.

Do with this info what you will.

As for me, I'm holding until HFs are sucked dry (using desktop so can't post diamond hands, rockets, apes, 'nanas emojis...forgive me).

Alrighty then, hold on for a big read. You’ll feel educated af after reading this as u/atobitt did an amazing job turning his DD into monke speak. Let's get a better understanding of the concepts first.

**(Note, I do not agree with the hypotheses drawn in** ***""the EVERYTHING short""*** **if that's not clear already).**

# WTF is a Repo and Reverse Repo?

&#x200B;

[Visualisation of how repos work](https://preview.redd.it/d0reff3wnrq61.png?width=573&format=png&auto=webp&s=519bb6f2e833f064f79fddf7a004a7a9834393ff)

This visualisation is saying that repos and reverse are the same transactions, but titled differently based on which side of the transaction you’re on.

If you’re originally selling the security (and agreeing to repurchase it in the future) this is a repurchase agreement (*“Repo”*). On the flip side, for the party originally buying the security (and agreeing to sell in the future) it is a reverse purchase agreement (*“Reverso Repo”*).

The key thing here that we need to understand, is how the Federal Reserve  uses repo and reverse repo agreements. **This is important, please pay attention here.**

**How the Federal Reserve Uses Repos/Rev Repos**

In the US, repo and reverse repo agreements are the most commonly used instruments of open market operations for the [Federal Reserve](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/rrp_faq.html).

As u/atobitt puts it, the Fed goes BRRRR. To put this into reverse ape talk, they are boosting the overall money supply by buying back Treasury bonds or other government debt instruments. This infuses the banks with cash and increases its cash reserves in the short term. The Fed then will then resell the securities back to the bank.

In summary, when the Fed wants to tighten the money supply - they can simply remove money from the cash flow using repos (selling bonds back to the banks). They want to go BRRRRR and [increase supply](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/rrp_faq.html)? Use a reverse repo later to buy back the bonds returning money into the system.

Great, we have a foundational understanding of how **liquidity** works through use of repos and reverse repos.

The next thing we need to understand is:

1. The financial panic that hit before the GFC in September 2008
2. Why this is different to the spikes we have been seeing in repo rates since 2019
3. How this relates back to Michael Burry updating his twitter profile linking [this](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm) and then removing it a day later from his profile

# The Crisis that Lead to a Crisis

Many people may be surprised to learn, but there was a financial panic that occurred just before the GFC in 2008 and that was the bailout of [Bear Stearns](https://www.aei.org/articles/the-bear-stearns-bailout-didnt-avert-the-financial-crisis-it-was-the-crisis/) in March 2008. The story started a little early than this in 2007/2008.

This financial panic of this period stemmed from our beloved repo market.In some [analysis done by NBER ](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15223)\- they argue that securities created from loans that originated in the now famous “subprime mortgage market” played a major role in inciting this panic.

BUT

That it’s ultimately the loss of liquidity at the firms that were the biggest players that led to the financial crisis.

To surmise their words without going into the details listed [here](https://www.nber.org/digest/dec09/repo-market-and-start-financial-crisis):

* Housing market started to weaken early 2007
* Repo market which was made up of securitized bonds (often made up of mortgages)
* Repo market buyers then started having a mini freak out worrying about the quality of the securitized assets in the bonds
* Repo market buyers also started to have a mini freakout about haircuts increasing (difference between the deposit and the value of an asset in a repo, the deposit is generally lower)

Banks would then raised capital by issuing new securities, didn’t work thanks to real estate continuing to slump.

Got made worse by forced selling of underlying collateral, which then turned into a cycle of declining asset values increasing these “haircuts” further.

**This leads us to the most important point.**

Due to this cycle above, lenders were saying FUCK NO to providing short term financing and repo haircuts jumped further, which is in equal part the equivalent of saying massive withdrawals from the banking system.

\*cough\* [fractional reserve banking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp) \*cough\*

**So what does this all imply?**

**This sequence of events fucked with the securitised banking cycle, which to everyone's dismay needs to run without interruption.**

**Monke Speak: If you get a kink somewhere along a hose, water (liquidity) dries up.**

I’ll stop here, but TL;DR for the rest of the story is that the kink becomes a knot and contagion spreads further (to other securities), eventually resulting in Bear Stearns being rescued and later the collapse of Lehman Brothers and some big bailouts = GFC of 2008. Note, in this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/)u/atobitt describes Lehman Brothers relationship with repo agreements, this whole “chapter” is discussing the crisis which caused the crisis.

The main point to takeaway out of all of this, is how reliant the system was/is on liquidity back in pre GFC times. Has this changed? Let’s find out.

# Fuck your Efficient Market Hypothesis

Thanks again to u/atobitt for the screenshots. The below is a more in-depth explanation of what u/atobitt went into, which will provide important context for later.

&#x200B;

[Thanks u\/atobitt for these.](https://preview.redd.it/tq7zu2c8orq61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd9d17788ecd02f9221470de9b1cee4104fbb16b)

There was a great case study done on this, and I value it thanks to the invaluable quotes from [market participants](https://www.ardea.com.au/repo-dislocations-a-case-study-in-market-inefficiency/#:~:text=The%20freezing%2Dup%20of%20repo,Financial%20Crisis%20(GFC).%E2%80%9D&text=The%20repo%20market%20is%20an,of%20the%20global%20financial%20system). For a more dry read, head on over to this [federal reserve link](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/what-happened-in-money-markets-in-september-2019-20200227.htm#:~:text=In%20the%20repo%20market%2C%20there,supply%20mismatch%20in%20the%20market) however.

**What went wrong?**

Pretty obvious here, repo rates spiking to \~6.5% then again to 10% a year later. As you likely know, this is absurdly high. We can expect some volatility at key quarter or year end reporting periods - but holy wow - not this level of volatility.

**Why did repo rates spike?**

The main reason is thanks to the Federal Reserve doing themselves a dirty. They introduced a bunch of regulations after the GFC so make sure stuff like this would not happen again. In late 2017, they started scaling down its quantitative easing (QE).

Remember how we \*coughed\* about [fractional reserve banking](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fractionalreservebanking.asp)? This is where it rears it’s ugly little head again, but in a different manner.

Us apes get paychecks, we dump our paychecks into our bank accounts to facilitate things like rent, mortgage repayments, food etc… This is the same case for the banks, except their deposits are chilling with the Fed in a special bank account known as *“bank reserves”*. These bank reserves have requirements on how much money is required at a minimum to be sitting in there. This is the minimum reserve requirement and anything they hold ontop of this is their excess reserves.

There’s a bunch of economic implications these reserves have, but the thing we want to focus on is the QE program implemented after the 2008 GFC in relation to **increasing the amount of excess reserve in banking systems.**

The side effect of this type of program means a banks excess reserves are not really excess anymore as they need to be increased to meet regulatory constraints. **This is the main reason why we saw a spike in the repo rate in the above chart.**

&#x200B;

[Never actually seen this movie](https://preview.redd.it/2w73gsnborq61.png?width=766&format=png&auto=webp&s=1347dfa5b09c1376cdeb146964b25df1ce9353ed)

Hop on in kids, let’s head back to pre-GFC times.

Another way of looking at the repo rate is from a demand perspective, naturally you’d expect a rate to **increase as supply remains the same but the demand increases**.

Back in the pre GFC times, when this **demand** for funding increases in the repo market, banks with excess reserves can quickly increase their lending capacity to take advantage of the higher rates. They used their excess reserves to increase the **supply** which means they can essentially get a grip on the rate to smooth it out.

# Data Time | Back to the Recent Past

Now, moving forward in time to the recent past, we’re post GFC and there are new rules for the banks. They need to start holding a minimum amount of high quality liquid assets (HQLA) on their balance sheets. Bonds classify as HQLA, but the “excess reserves” are more efficient.

In the image below, we have two charts. The top showing total reserves (excess reserves are a component of this) and the bottom showing our overnight repo rate we’re all familiar with.

1. The Fed starts scaling back QE in late 2017 (they stopped buying bonds from the banks)
2. This meant the Fed stops crediting the banks excess reserves (the slow reduction in total reserves in the top chart)
3. Reduction in supply (reserves dropping from 2.) means repo rate starts to increase
4. Demand for repo funding increased in September, but due to frictions like HQLA it prevented banks from “smoothing out” the rate
5. BOOM overnight repo rate spikes to 10% in late 2019.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ew01hlhorq61.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f07792b1eafb4b9fd95a666bfba88791b4f3723

Everyone and their mothers at the Fed would have shit themselves that day. The funny thing is that JPMorgen CEO [said](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-15/jpmorgan-felt-barred-from-calming-repo-market-by-regulations) that they could have prevented this from happening, but were stopped thanks to regulations such as the HQLA.

So what does the Fed decide to do next? Fed goes BRRR.

The effective [federal funds rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/federalfundsrate.asp) below is the rate at which commercial banks can borrow and lend their excess reserves to each other overnight.

[BRRRRRR](https://preview.redd.it/o69kymakorq61.png?width=793&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8f1f1e54d135e4bc8bc84cb936879fcf6f4123e)

To delve into a little deeper why higher reserves mean a more stable rate, what we’re really saying is that banks can turn a profit from pricing inefficiencies in the market. If they did not have the HQLA restriction as on example, they may have been able to shift assets around on their balance sheet when they see the repo rate start to creep higher to make a nice dime off it.

This is very much how the world worked pre GFC, and you can see the Fed have essentially created a kink in the hose themselves which caused this volatility thanks to liquidity issues once more.

So, that’s essentially a long winded explanation of u/atobitt’s post that goes into a bit more detail and has a focus on the liquidity aspect. I’ll also end this section with the following.

*“Liquidity, like the plumbing in your house, gets little attention until something goes wrong …”*

**Edit** u/UserID_3425 linked me fed announcment:

[Federal reserves in response to COVID](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm) dropped reserve requirements to 0%.

It was after they changed this rule they decided to drop fed rates (thanks COVID...) which caused the above reserves to further skyrocket as they injected $500B into the repo market. (Their last lever essentially)

# Collateral Chains

Alright, back to Michael Burry. He put a link in his profile for about a day, maybe less then removed it again.

&#x200B;

[He trying to tell us something... but what?](https://preview.redd.it/5z91e19norq61.png?width=298&format=png&auto=webp&s=92790b3d797c6e9b96c0289361948f0cde24ee0d)

Why did he link this and what’s in it? Why is the timing so convenient? Alot of what’s discussed in the linked federal reserve notes is scarily similar to what u/atobitt was touching on. It’s all about the circulation of collateral, so let’s dig into it.

**“Collateral”.** We got an intro to this above in regards to repos - it refers to an asset that a lender accepts on security for a loan. Collateral can be really handy, it can be used quickly to raise funds (repos as an example) or to things like satisfying margin requirements.

BUT they can also be re-used e.g. A HF gives securities as collateral to their broker and then the broker can use this collateral sources securities in order to sell them (shorting 😉)

**“Collateral Chains”.** Collateral re-use sounds shady af i hear you say?

Well, yes - all this free circulation of collateral comes at the cost of increased interconnectedness and contributes to the fragility in financial markets by increasing the confusion about WHO THE FUCK HOLDS THE COLLATERAL and WHO THE FUCK RETURNS THE IT.

This is our collateral chain. That’s referred to in the paper and it propagates uncertainty and amplifies fragility in times of market stress.

~~The screenshots showing Palafox increasing their repo and reverse repo start to make a lot of sense now.~~

They still make sense, but everyone in the industry is likely behaving similar to this.

# Financial Institutions are Dynamic

Now, this is a bit of new speculation that you’ve not heard of in u/atobitt’s post and i believe is what Michael Brrrrry has been attempting to communicate to us (hit me up if i’m wrong MB! I hate spreading misinformation.)

1. Why did we see an increase every year in repo and reverse repo agreements?
2. Why did 2020 see a greater than 100% increase?

I’m speculating that this is to do with QE being lifted and then the major reversal of the Fed in 2020 to drop rates due to what we saw in 2019. After all, when they see a new opportunity they gotta jump on it, can’t be relying on outdated practices.

**Why did we see an increase every year in repo and reverse repo agreements?**

Let’s go back to 2008, the federal rate is increasing and financial institutions are taking on more risk - we also see the overnight repo rates increasing in line as a correlation, which makes sense. However, what caused the bubble to pop back then and QE and other measures to take place is different to our recent past. They at least still had liquidity in the repo market (up until the kink in the hose formed).

~~From 2016 onwards QE starts lifting and federal rates start increasing, therefore it’s harder for our HF bois to make money, and start looking at other ways to instead…..~~

~~If there were more of the screenshots above going back to 2016, I’d bet my pug on it that their balance sheet would show it increasing year on year since QE was being lifted.~~

u/oaf_king owns my pug now. Below is a chart of their balance sheets going back until 2006.

&#x200B;

[https:\/\/sec.report\/CIK\/0001284170](https://preview.redd.it/1wrnobvxiuq61.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=9100cb9fb1d84ce7076b818697fcd441d66c9a66)

Note, the blue and red line are extremely close to each other, which is why you don't see the repo series in the chart easily.

What this chart is showing us is that Pallofax has sporadically utilised the repo market before when fed rates were low (2008-2017). When the Fed started to lift QE in 2017 we see some brakes being applied to their use of the repo market (and showing growth for the most part YoY since 2015) soon before it EXPLODES in 2020 when fed rates drop to close to 0% again.

**Based on fed rates dropping, it's not surprising and it's likely an industry trend, not just isolated to Pallofax.**

Speculate away apes.

Why?

Because they are greedy and have been re-using collateral to create collateral chains as they can make some decent cash off the ""leverage"" they receive in return.

Shithead B: Oh, sick - you know how we’ve been using re-using collateral to make dosh?

Shithead A: Fuk, We can do this at an even cheaper rate now.

Shithead B: Win win, \*snorts cocaine\*

# Translate What this means into Monke Please

We don’t actually know whether they’re shorting these or not, but given Palafox’s connection to Shitadel (they own Palafox), it’s a possibility.

**Edit: The above is speculation, their goal is to remain neutral, the conclusions drawn in the EVERYTHING short are flawed to a point in my eyes due to this. Refer to the post below for more details. Thanks** u/crazysearch

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mif5o1/debunking\_the\_the\_everything\_short/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mif5o1/debunking_the_the_everything_short/)

What we do know is, and in the words of u/SirCrimsonKing they are “extending paper beyond gold”

I’ll use his words as he put it very well in terms of what shitfuckery they’ve got themselves into with an accounting lense.

One piece of collateral is the basis for multiple transactions (collateral chain), Palafox is carrying $16.46 Billion in assets, rather than being “real” assets with a minor portion invested in hedging instruments, their assets are almost entirely derivatives.

So they are basically saying a substantial portion of their positions are rehypothecated.

In other words.. we call ""assets"" things people owe us, but we don't have. We call ""liabilities"" things we owe other people - we don't HAVE what we owe them, but we ""expect"" it from people on our asset/receivable side.

So they’ve built a house without any foundations. Fuck. I’ve seen [this movie before](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/).

As we said above what they’re doing:

*“Propagates uncertainty and amplifies fragility in times of market stress.”*

# How Big is the Problem?

I believe this is the second thing Mr MB was trying to bring to our attention, which is an exposure of this problem **THROUGHOUT the industry**, not just Shitadel.

&#x200B;

[Fig 2a. https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/econres\/notes\/feds-notes\/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm](https://preview.redd.it/hy1dovq8prq61.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=a36b4f908cb30c98052f07dfaf99d0552ed57a3f)

Above we have a graph that shows the incoming and outgoing collateral, focus on the NON dotted lines. Of the outgoing collateral, around 65-70% of the collateral is being reused or as we say “rehypothecated”. It’s also representing close to $2 trillion.

Say that in your head one more time. **$2 Trillion.**

This [paper](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm) he gave us is a gold mine, my only wish is that it went back further in time. Anywho, Let’s dig into the rehypothecated portion of this outgoing collateral.

&#x200B;

[Fig 2b, 2c. https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/econres\/notes\/feds-notes\/ins-and-outs-of-collateral-re-use-20181221.htm](https://preview.redd.it/zvpxdbqcprq61.png?width=1149&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1744077eba56d1606c903cff947165f4782c5f6)

Focus on the right side, as we’re mainly interested in rehypothecated products.

* That’s alot of fucking rehypothecated shorts \~$400B
* Repo agreements are the largest at $1T, what’s interesting about this?

&#x200B;

[Fig 3a, link above](https://preview.redd.it/xb9i5yjhprq61.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddcd5b7360b7eec0c209e153f9789b0b1cd52b11)

Fucking feel the onion mate, this is a subset of the first graph, focused on Treasury securities only. I nearly spat out my tea when I saw this.

That motherfucking green line, High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA). The green line essentially represents the securities coming in backed by - you guessed it - treasury securities which are unencumbered.

The tiny amount of HGLA treasury securities held pretty much suggest that the majority of US treasury securities held are in other parts of consolidated firms \*Cough\* Shitadel \*Cough\*

&#x200B;

[Fig 3b, 3c](https://preview.redd.it/jfpqys2lprq61.png?width=1159&format=png&auto=webp&s=66024cc24f4ef56dae44d82dc62d352ce14ffbd2)

One last layer of onion to peel, I swear.  There’s two observations which are interesting and one brings flashbacks.

* Most of the US Treasury circulation done is heavily dependent on the repo market

Along with a specific line mentioned in the text of the paper. “...seniority of repos in bankruptcy”.

I’m no law ape, so I request u/Leaglese chime in and help interpret this further, so until he does take this with a grain of salt.

This [paper](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/5576/BoltonOehmkeDerivatives.pdf) from Columbia Law School discusses whether derivatives should be privileged in bankruptcy. Why is this interesting?

Guess who’s using a fuck tonne of [deep ITM Puts](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mibedc/the_moass_wont_happen_until_options_are_not/) to hide FTDs in GME and also has a balance sheet that has a fuck tonne of derivatives? Yep…. Shitadel…. (Options are a category of derivative product btw)

I won’t speculate how this may work with Shitadel and their many branches, and will await a legal ape to help flesh this out for what it’s worth.

* Unencumbered collateral swaps is double rehypothecated swaps for Treasury securities and is growing

This is saying that our bois are using collateral swaps to upgrade their collateral. Through these contracts, whoever is engaging in collateral swaps, is exchanging securities with **lower credit quality,** thereby “upgrading” their collateral.

Well, I’ve seen [this movie before](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1596363/), once a-fucking-gain.

# Who Likes Leverage? You Might Like This...

&#x200B;

[fig 6d](https://preview.redd.it/j2m80f7qprq61.png?width=981&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c9320844dbc1d3213c0e72bab7e0a319c80c816)

Another fucking chart jsmar?? Yes. Last one, I promise.

Before we can understand wtf is going on here, let’s understand the **Collateral Multiplier**, which is something the researchers designed for this analysis specifically.

The Collateral Multiplier is pretty much a “money multiplier”, In the “money multiplier”, a percentage of funds a bank receives through deposits (**liabilities**) are held as reserves (**assets**). The remaining funds are lent out in the form of loans (assets), which become new deposits in another bank, which then repeats the process. Yeah, sounds fishy already hey?

Let’s refer back to the graph, what’s saying is that Primary Dealers (Essentially market makers of treasury securities…. Yep… I know…) “create” seven times as many assets backed by treasury securities than they own. The blue lines show the lower bound and upper bound of their samples.

So yeah, this is prevalent, indicated by the confidence interval, at the extreme end indicating firms “create” 10 times as many assets backed by treasury securities with a lower bound of \~5.

# A Funny Parallel

Now, this is where we can draw parallels with MBS, MBS were notoriously easy to sell as they were viewed as being safe as.

What we’re seeing in the graph above and is telling us is that Treasury securities are easy to monetize, hence why they are getting abused to the tune of 7 times per one US Treasury security.

# Conclusion

I believe this is what Michael Burry was actually trying to tell us (this is all speculation still).

As a result of the liquidity and reserve changes in reaction to the GFC in 2008, financial institutions have decided to abuse US Treasury Securities (UST) through the means of the repo market.

They are:

* Creating fragility in the financial system through collateral chains as they’re creating an interconnectedness between different firms

&#x200B;

* Abusing US Treasury Securities to the tune of 7 times per one security. A lot of assets “backed” by Treasury Securities **could** be fucked. Speculative of course.

&#x200B;

* The problem is huge $800B Rehypothecated UST Repos as of Sep-2018

&#x200B;

* Collateral swaps are on the rise…. Making shittier quality assets look better than they are…

&#x200B;

* The system ~~nearly imploded~~  had a scare in late 2019 when measures implemented to protect the market post-GFC essentially worked against the market

&#x200B;

* Shitadel doubled down on USTs when the fed lowered rates in response to the COVID for the large part - **but so did the entire industry**.

# Closing Remarks

I have had lots of great conversations with a range of smart apes, and the same consensus has been drawn multiple times. How the Repo market is currently being used, is **normal.** We do have an indication of the industry leveraging themselves up on UTS through repos, but we don't really have the context of if this is a historic high.

We also do not know if there is any fraud involved, the quality of assets being backed by UTS and so on. It's unlikely that we will see a 'market collapse' unless evidence rears its head and catches both retail investors by surprise AS WELL as the Federal Reserve through either:

1. Severe Overlergarging
2. Fraud
3. How interconnected the system really is

**Where to next…?**

Who the fuck knows, ~~it’s walking on a knives edge and the MOASS of GME may just be the catalyst towards blowing up the market yet again~~.

**Conjecture Edit:** Removing the last piece as it's way too speculative.

One last *ominous* word. Liquidity.

Not financial advice, just an ape reading documents. Please contribute valuable opinions or corrections through PM as I'll 100% answer through that channel.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Consequences TLDR - thanks** u/Anarchist73 (Note, everything is still speculation);

*""This post finally made me understand what was trying to be said by the everything short post and Micheal burry. Essentially these rehypothecated treasuries are being used as AAA collateral the same way Synthetic CDOs were being used as ""high quality"" investments or collateral. Except there are no real bonds if you look under the hood. It's all derivatives, the collateral doesn't actually exist, and the entire systems leverage ratios are far in excess of what anyone believes it to be.""*

Important Note From Me: **I do not personally agree** with the conclusions drawn in the EVERYTHING short. The post does not imply the entire systems leverage ratios are in far excess either (we have no upper bound context), so take that with a grain of salt. Neither does it imply fraud is going on like back in 2008. **We simply do not know.**

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Added a good TLDR of the consequences from u/Anarchist73

**Edit:** Tagged the wrong u/Leaglese

**Edit:** Updated some wording and u/oaf_king decided he wanted my Pug so he went through Pallofax's historical EOY reports.

&#x200B;

[Thanks u\/oaf\_king](https://preview.redd.it/2yvq0984iuq61.png?width=598&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa16b562283ab989547c50fc22cf4c4f9944da6d)

Note, the blue and red line are extremely close to each other, which is why you don't see the repos.

What this chart is showing us is that Pallofax has sporadically utilised the repo market before when fed rates were low (2008-2017). When the Fed started to lift QE in 2017 we see some brakes being applied to their use of the repo market (and showing growth for the most part YoY since 2015) soon before it EXPLODES in 2020 when fed rates drop to close to 0% again.

Speculate away apes.

**This is a trend reflected across the industry as a whole. Not just limited to Pallofax.**

**Conjecture Edit:** As you apes know I like some good conjecture as it helps us all here is a link to a comment by u/LatinVocalsFinalBoss. While it does sound combative, don't give the ape flack for it.

# Quadruple witching Day

So today is the 19th on which stock index futures, stock index options, stock options, and single stock futures expire simultaneously. While stock options contracts and index options expire on the third Friday of every month, all four asset classes expire simultaneously on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.

Today we'll also see the ETF's rebalance and I have no clue how that will turn out, one thing I do know is today will be expensive for them if they even touch the etf's as today is Dividends day.

Also what you need to keep in mind is that we have been seeing lower and lower volume time and time again, as you've seen in the great DD I've posted in the past 2 days ( [https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/) ) this is cyclical

Every time the volume gets low it pops for a bit, from $40 (24/2) to $120 (01/3) to $240 on (10/3).So going by this marker alone we can expect this to go up in the next days.

\*\*Addendum:\*\*Remember WE know the dates THEY know the dates, expect them to try and pull all the stops, expect fuckery as always, expect them to try and crash the price, or a fake squeeze saying ""welp this was $400 that was it"" YOU KNOW BETTER!

Seriously let the fuckery begin but rule by logic, not emotion.

# Expect SHILLCON1

We've always seen shills/bots/trolls more active on the days it matters the most, so guys for the love of everything that's holy relax, listen to the people you know ignore all forms of FUD spreading.

Things we can see today are varied, from ""I'm worried for your money plz sell"" to distracting to other stonks, trying to get people to paperhand, mass report the guys that do the most like unfortunately u/wardenelite yesterday and u/heyitspixel this morning.

at this point I'll be waiting for mine, but I'll keep the mods informed and try updating via that.

&#x200B;

Just know if the reason you've bought the stock haven't changed why should you change your position.

be vigilant today but be on your extreme best behavior, being nice helps!

because people are nice we where able to weed out the shills easily, we where able to see who is who very fast, because shills can't be nice and do their job.

# Beware of incoming gains FUD

originally posted by  [u/CroakyBear1997](https://www.reddit.com/user/CroakyBear1997/)

    Prepare for shill fake gains when MOASS starts.
    If I was a hedgie worth billions of dollars what would I do?
    
    I would create fake portfolios with Photoshop and spam post gain porn when 
    the MOASS starts so that apes will freak out and start panic selling.
    
    If the stock hits say 100k, they will spam post all the stock subreddits and 
    Twitter etc. 
    With fake photoshopped portfolios and gain porn to trick the ape community 
    that big winners and investors have realized their gains and the stock won't 
    rise more.
    
    How to best avoid that?
    In my opinion the easiest and best way to fight this tricky strategy 
    which they 100% will try out is to restrict ANY gain porn on this sub. 
    Make it so that all gainporns until X days post MOASS will result 
    in an instant ban so that apes won't get screwed over.
    
    If I was Melvin or Citadel I'd already have a few hundred fake pictures of gains
    within different price ranges so I can adapt to the violent price movements to come.
    
    Remember apes: 1.000.000 is not a meme, we are all in this rocketship, 
    it is fueled and pointing at Andromeda. 
    All we have to wait for is an alpha silver back gorilla to 
    press the huge red button on the dashboard.
    
    In short: I like the stock, hold!

    Edit: this rule is already in action for this sub but as far as I know r/wallstreetbets doesn't have this rule and many of us are still in there so brace yourselves for a shit ton of FUD coming from wsb.

written by:  [u/Accurate\_Ad\_4055](https://www.reddit.com/user/Accurate_Ad_4055/)

    Let me remind you: 
    
    Their only way out is GameStop going bankrupt
    
    The price does not matter anywhere below $1.000.000. 
    Nobody is selling and so it must remain until this plays out as 
    they have set it up to play out. 
    Only issue for them: their bet did not play out. 
    They bet on GameStop defaulting on their loan on 03/15/2021. 
    
    They bet on GameSpot being dead by now.
    
    Their bet is done and no matter how far they kick this can down the road, the MOASS is inevitable.
    
    It does not matter if they short it down to $50 or even $38 again. 
    They will only scare off those that aren't already involved and 
    we have seen that nobody is selling.
    
    The tiniest amount of buying pressure will brake the flextape seals they 
    keep throwing on this with ever more shorts.
    
    No matter how long this will take. 
    Wait. Hold. Buy the dips and average up as well as down, 
    depending on what is affordable to you. 
    No day trading. 
    No selling shares to switch brokers.
    
    Hold.

No matter what you see, the only way out is for GME to go bankrupt or Citadel.

Expect everything today!

We can see this go up as well as down, dont get scared if you see this go to $100 and dont get scared if you see it go to 400.

We have diamond handed through the lows time and time again, so if we go up, diamond hand there as well, the price is whatever we set it too.

People have ridiculed some of us saying higher numbers (100,000+) are unattainable, yet with researching I've not found anything indicative that there even is a ceiling.

They are using bots/trolls/shills to spread FUD, get some of us to fear what will happen.

They told us it was over when we hit $15 bucks, then $20 then after the first spike back to $40, and now at $200 they're saying it's over again.

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

u/OakAged did a great writeup of things that need to be known

1. Key accounts being banned - [/u/Warden\_Elite](https://www.reddit.com/u/Warden_Elite) who does the daily charting which is amazing, was banned, as was [/u/HeyItsPixel](https://www.reddit.com/u/HeyItsPixel) \- false reports by the shills no doubt. u/WardenElite2 is the confirmed alternative account for Warden\_Elite (Confirmed via his twitter warden\_elite). pixel confirmed his new one is u/heyitsnotjosh
2. Anticipated levels price will drop to today - Some greater ape has been analyzing the charts and based on where the support levels are identified the prices we could expect to drop to today - it looks like 140 might be the lowest, so if you're wanting to buy more that might be a good buy target! Not financial advice. [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m84bit/gme\_319\_price\_levels\_to\_watch/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m84bit/gme_319_price_levels_to_watch/)
3. The trading volume in GME has been dropping off the cliff in the past few days - no one seems to be selling, and I guess the hedgies are nervous because of the increasing awareness of their nonsense! [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7xqfh/35\_mil\_to\_14\_mil\_to\_9\_mil\_volume\_last\_three\_days/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7xqfh/35_mil_to_14_mil_to_9_mil_volume_last_three_days/)
4. GME Hiring - Now, there's been quite a few news articles about how the squeeze is done, and ""here's why GME is dropping"" and the general implication is that the results next week are not going to be great or show much.

BULLISH!!!!!!!!",1616527111.0,">“I just got your email, I’m so sorry this happened. Let me get to the bottom of this,” Cohen told Titus.

   

(Reuters) - After almost four months of phone calls and emails to GameStop Corp complaining about the slow shipping of an order, New Jersey teacher Steven Titus received a late night call in early March - from a director on the video game retailer’s board.

On the line was Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder and former chief executive of online pet supplies retailer Chewy who is now leading GameStop’s push into e-commerce. Cohen was responding to an email Titus had sent 12 hours earlier to more than two dozen GameStop executives and board members.

“NOBODY has attempted to respond except a muddled voicemail with no distinguishable callback number or extension. E-commerce requires a customer support team and processes that are responsive,” Titus wrote.

“I just got your email, I’m so sorry this happened. Let me get to the bottom of this,” Cohen told Titus.

Cohen then asked GameStop’s new customer service chief Kelli Durkin, who spearheaded initiatives at Chewy that included written personal notes to customers, to look into the matter. Titus was reimbursed for his purchase, even though he had not requested a refund and was only complaining about the tardiness of his order.

The anecdote, described by Titus and GameStop insiders, is representative of the intensity Cohen has brought to the Grapevine, Texas-based company as he pursues an against-the-odds transformation of the brick-and-mortar retailer into an e-commerce firm that can take on big-box retailers such as Target Corp and Walmart Inc and technology firms such as Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp.

Since Cohen joined GameStop’s board in January, the 35-year-old entrepreneur has been obsessing about customer service, contacting customers late into the night to solicit feedback, and has made a push to upgrade the company’s website and online ordering system, eight people who work with or know Cohen said in interviews. Cohen aims to turn GameStop into the “Chewy of gaming” with lower prices, better selection and faster delivery times, said the sources, most of them speaking on condition of anonymity.

Wall Street analysts are doubtful Cohen - a college dropout who says he learned the ins and outs of business from his late father, who was a glass importer - can win back GameStop customers who have become accustomed to streaming video games. Some are struggling to understand why the creator of the world’s most valuable online pet supplies store would take on a moribund video game retailer as a turnaround project.

The sources said Cohen’s efforts are driven by a belief that video game lovers will turn to a dedicated internet shop just as pet lovers turned to Chewy.

“He has the courage of conviction and that muscle memory of doing this before,” said Jay Park, a former Chewy investor who founded Prysm Capital.

Cohen declined to comment through a spokesman.

His attempted turnaround would have been less in the public eye had GameStop not captured the imagination in January of an army of amateur traders on social media site Reddit who helped drive the company’s market value to a peak of $33.7 billion at the end of that month, from $1.4 billion days before. It is now worth about $14 billion. A year ago, GameStop’s market capitalization was $250 million.

Cohen invested in GameStop last year before the stock became a social media sensation. His 13% stake in the company, on which he spent roughly $75 million, is now worth about $1.8 billion.

None of this is financial advice.

# Shills, shills everywhere.

So as some must have seen yesterday the sub got flooded with messages saying ""Warden is a shill"" with little to back it up, does this sound familiar to someone ?

Because it sounds familiar to me.

Let's make a few things very clear here, everyone here is doing this as a volunteer, no one is getting paid by anyone and put all their findings here. Are those findings always a 100% correct? no.

So I have a very simple rule to keep in mind

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4spxna6zm4q61.png?width=824&format=png&auto=webp&s=f542f6366355ff9725184346c9d67e492dafa3c6

so it's simple right? If you dislike someone's work, prove that their work is flawed. not with ""gut feeling"" or saying ""I disagree with them"" but prove it ""this person said X but it is Y because if you look at obv+S/L it shows... etc etc""

I've seen people try character assassination with both Pixel, the mods and myself, and you either back it up with facts or shut up. this is a place that is rooted in facts and documents, not feelings.

If someone says something you disagree with, be an adult and move on. this isn't high school, so we wont be entertaining high school level drama.

People were bitching that Pixel was too optimistic, now they're complaining that Warden for being too careful in his estimates, pick a lane people.

And even if you listen to anyone on this board, be it me, warden, or Bigdaddydick69 or coomslayer420, take their info that they presented and analyze it yourself and come to your own conclusions.

Don't trust anyone here and make your own decisions, but make sure every decision is well formed.

https://preview.redd.it/af5vcgv7q4q61.jpg?width=522&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25aa43afb7f9376a5dc87a5d9a7a415b0854c10f

# Accounting for Bias

For the people that haven't been along long enough to be accustomed to this term, guys account for your own bias.

I'm saying this because last weekend we've seen a hedge fund Archegos die this past weekend and people are flocking to it because "" THIS MUST BE BECAUSE OF GME"".

so let's go over some few basic key points that I hope will help you guys to be more critical thinkers and be able to help the community better.

* ***Bias is the tendency to favor one thing over another***
* ***Bias is a natural, normal human tendency***
* **We like and find reasons to reject the things that don't fit that Bias**
* **Learn what your biases are**
* **Don't react from a gut feeling, take a step back and look at all the data**

Sounds simple right?

Everyone here favors GME, that's our bias.

We want something to happen to GME yesterday if possible, therefore everything that happens right now is connected to gme in our minds.

And if someone comes and says oh but I found X to not fit within this, that person gets attacked because we don't like to see that stuff because it's uncomfortable to have things that doesn't fit our bias.

Therefore your emotions want to go hard ""keyboard warrior"", don't take a step back and think why this person may be saying something and try to learn. even if the person saying shit that's plainly wrong, find their reasoning, why would they say it.

Rule with logic, not emotion.

Under Section 5.2.1

>… the amount of [Clearing Fund](https://www.dtcc.com/~/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rules/nscc_rules.pdf) required from each Member is determined principally by Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) calculations,21 and that in order to ensure the VaR model accurately reflects market conditions and provides adequate protection against market risk, NSCC evaluates several factors on an ongoing basis. The proposed rule change would remove the following factor as one of those evaluated, because it is no longer part of NSCC’s model calculation, “Implied volatility to assess whether a potential increase in market price volatility may not be fully incorporated in the historical price moves.""22

2. The NSCC can pull funds from the Clearing Fund to help pay for a Member’s losses 2 business days after a [loss allocation notice](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2018/34-82428.pdf).

Under Section 6.4

>In order to be consistent with the language formulation set out in Rule 4, the proposed rule change would revise this sentence to state, “Losses charged to Members are required to be paid by Members on the second business day after the Corporation issues any such notice of a loss allocation charge and, if not timely paid by any Member, the Corporation may treat that Member as having failed to satisfy its obligation and apply the Clearing Fund deposit of that Member to satisfy its loss allocation obligation.”

For more information be sure to check his thread because he covers all the points I would and he did an amazing job with it.

Now there is only one piece missing... oh right the DTCC-2021-801, if all goes well we should see this one kick in soon as well.

# Sideways baby

For we go further let's go back to my prefered saying ""we can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent"".

So I heard a lot of chatter on the sub yesterday about sideways trading being bad, and guess what, you'd be wrong. Going sideways is actually kindof good.

We are currently above max pain territory (which I believe is 160/170 at the moment), and we must doing something right if you look at the history of Shitadel and Melvin in these past months, because they're losing a lot of money, even going so far as to offer shit grade bonds to get some cash.

Well there is one thing better than just waiting on a catalyst to happen, it's inflicting max pain and waiting.

Seriously everyone keeps talking about this being the endgame etc, chill people this can take a day a week or till the shareholders meeting in june, no one knows how long this will last, so grow a pair and learn to sit back and relax.

u/whiskiz did a great writeup [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfyjit/sideways_trading_until_a_catalystliftoff_is_what/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) which go's into better detail then I did here.

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

""**The R&W Plan** sets forth the plan to be used by the Board and NSCC management in the event NSCC encounters scenarios that could potentially prevent it from being able to provide its critical services as a going concern. The R&W Plan is structured as a roadmap that defines **the strategy and identifies the tools available to NSCC to either (i) recover, in the event it experiences losses that exceed its prefunded resources (such strategies and tools referred to herein as the “Recovery Plan”) or (ii) wind-down its business in a manner designed to permit the continuation of NSCC’s critical services in the event that such recovery efforts are not successful** (such strategies and tools referred to herein as the “Wind-down Plan”). The recovery tools available to NSCC are **intended to address the risks of (a) uncovered losses or liquidity shortfalls resulting from the default of one or more of its Members**, and (b) losses arising from non-default events, such as damage to NSCC’s physical assets, a cyber-attack, or custody and investment losses, and the strategy for implementation of such tools...

The proposed rule change is designed to update and enhance the clarity of the Plan **to ensure it is current in the event it is ever necessary to be implemented.** ""

**""Section 5.3 (Liquidity Shortfalls) of the Plan identifies tools that may be used to address foreseeable shortfalls of NSCC’s liquidity resources following a Member default.** The goal in managing NSCC’s qualified liquidity resources is to maximize resource availability *in an evolving stress situation*, to maintain flexibility in the order and use of sources of liquidity, and to repay any third-party lenders of liquidity in a timely manner...

First, the proposed rule change would revise the entries for “3. Obligation Warehouse” and “10. CNS/Prime Broker Interface” to delete the check mark denoting the lack of alternative providers and products as one of the determinants for its classification as a critical service.” *(DAYUM DAT WAS A BURN DOE)*

""Also, the proposed rule change would update Table 3-B (NSCC Critical Services) to add “Account Information Transmission” (“AIT”). This new entry would include in the description of AIT18 that it is being enhanced in support of the bulk transfer initiative, which is an industry effort **designed to prepare carrying broker-dealers for an emergency mass transfer of large quantities of customer accounts and assets from a distressed broker to a financially secure broker.**

**2. Member Default Losses through the Crisis Continuum Section 5** (Member Default Losses through the Crisis Continuum) of the Plan is comprised of multiple subsections that identify the risk management surveillance, tools, and governance that NSCC may employ across an increasing stress environment, referred to as the “Crisis Continuum.” **This section currently identifies, among other things, the tools that can be employed by NSCC to mitigate losses, and mitigate or minimize liquidity needs, as the market environment becomes increasingly stressed.** As more fully described below, the proposed rule change would clarify certain language. Section 5.2.1 (Stable Market Phase) describes NSCC’s risk management activities in the normal course of business. **These activities include (i) the routine monitoring of margin adequacy through daily evaluation of backtesting and stress testing results that review the adequacy of NSCC’s margin calculations, and escalation of those results to internal and Board committees and (ii) routine monitoring of liquidity adequacy through review of daily liquidity studies that measure sufficiency of available liquidity resources to meet cash settlement obligations** of the Member that would generate the largest aggregate payment obligation.""

GUYS, THIS IS ONLY UP TO PAGE 13. I COULD GO ON BUT HERE I WILL LINK THE PDF WITH JOY:

[https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2021/34-91428.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2021/34-91428.pdf)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**APE TL;DR**  The NSCC (National Securities Clearing Corporation) (a subsidiary of DTCC), has filed this document TODAY. The NSCC and DTCC are Clearing corporations, so basically, they are the ones who are stuck with the bag of dogshit when the HFs come to them and say ""ummmmm we fuked"". So they filed this document today. Many parts to this document, but one part for example was, to clarify **""the plan""** of what would happen if shit hits the fan basically.

In their words:

1. The plan ""is intended to address the risks of (a) uncovered losses or liquidity shortfalls resulting from the default of one or more of its Members,""
2. The Plan ""identifies tools that may be used to address foreseeable shortfalls of NSCC’s liquidity resources following a Member default""
3. The plans goal ""is to maximize resource availability ***in an evolving stress situation***, to maintain flexibility in the order and use of sources of liquidity, **and to repay any third-party lenders of liquidity in a timely manner.**..""
4. The plan supports ""an industry effort designed to prepare carrying broker-dealers **for an emergency mass transfer of large quantities of customer accounts and assets from a distressed broker to a financially secure broker.**
5. Next section is on ""**the tools that can be employed by NSCC to mitigate losses, and mitigate or minimize liquidity needs, as the market environment becomes increasingly stressed.** ""

I could go on but then it wouldn't be a TLDR, but I will just say there is NO way I can cover this entire doc in a TLDR, if you want the full perspective its worth the read tomorrow maybe when you guys are less high and have more caffeine pumping through your blood.

&#x200B;

TLDR; This price stability, volume low, is not natural -- a metaphorical spring is suppressing at great force right now. Gamma potential is building for the coming weeks. Catalyst for launch growing. No dates, but the longer this goes, the more power I see growing.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Warning... only one picture ahead and a wall of text, arguably some fractional size of the library of congress (truth) in .txt size. You will wrinkle the brains if you continue... I'm not financial guy. I just like explaining things in simple ways. Enjoy...

&#x200B;

This, is not normal... that's volume minute by minute

[12:20ish 4\/1 trading GME](https://preview.redd.it/2hrqqsv4rlq61.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=afd396ca8d4e45cef312bb385d83bf8eb4ee8a8e)

that large movement of $2 in price in low volume, then sudden brakes applied to the movement with high volume to bring it back.... it's not isolated either. This has been happening since last Thursday, after we corrected from those Media shenanigans after the Q4 Earnings Report (down to $115, and right back up to $180).

What I've seen, and many others have been noticing and mentioned too, is this odd consolidation at Max Pain levels. This is a term to signal how to apply the maximum damage to Options players (Puts and Calls) - HFs in particular, since they are all up in those options. See when IV (Implied Volatility) is way up there, everyone gets excited about swings and maximizing gains on those swings.

&#x200B;

# MAX PAIN

So back to the point about Max Pain. IV makes Calls more expensive. The simple explanation for this is... when volatility (movement) in the stock is high, people are more willing to bet on up and down movement and they'll pay more to play a gamble on it, because with wild swings (up to $250 and down to $125 in a week... odds are they'll gain). When we float by slowly, at $180, then $183, then $191, then $193 all week... well that is a damp towel over the raging fire that is high IV excitement like we saw last week.

For the last few months HFs have been making money playing these swings in price (Tuesday $180, Wednesday $115, Thursday $215 <--- remember that last week? I think I got the dates right), sucking money out of the options market. They likely have survived longer than the otherwise would have because of this cash. It also allows them to float their FTDs forward. They need this churning, they hate when we just HODL and avoid the options market.

&#x200B;

# The Whale

Enter the Whale (we are riding next to, under, beside, anyone on top?). Imagine someone with FU money... $50,000,000 sitting in an account, and a huge pile of shares (just under the reportable limit)... they want to inflict the max punishment on the HFs before watching them burn. So they stop the wild swings in GME price by doing this:

**High**: when we are $2 above current price, hit every single buy order with a sale, hammer that price back down, but not so hard it goes down, just enough to keep us in this channel. (the chart above is literally this)

**Low**: when we are $2 below current price, hit every single seller with a buy order, hammer that price back up, but not so hard it takes off, just enough to keep it in this channel. (it's almost happening just like the chart above... over and over)

This dries up volume. It also keeps the stock stable. Money piles in and out of stocks based on movement, and if that movement is always suppressed, it never builds. It waits... we're all waiting. Patiently. Eating crayons.

What this also accomplishes, is lowering that IV figure - the cost to play Calls. Remember that IV is like the cost to play the gamble. Well, if we sit all week between $185-195 ... next week the call writers aren't going to get as much premium because everyone thinks... this is stable, not moving much, why would I pay high fees to gamble on price going above $200? This is setting the stage for a Gamma squeeze. When IV gets low, the prices of those 200, 220, 250 Calls do as well. **Large players** start to buy them in mass and when the Whale removes that ceiling ""oh, you thought that was permanent? lullz"" (stops selling every time we start to go up) well we set off a Gamma squeeze, that rockets us back towards $300, and beyond. This, aligned with other factors, can initiate the real squeeze as well. No dates. Stop asking. This could go on another week, two, three... more...

Ok I wrote too much. I'm not going to go back and proof read. As you could see in my post yesterday where I wrote too much. I no spell good, and I think Commas as Comas. But I did manage to get hot pink in my chart again. Is that a thing yet? :)

&#x200B;

Reminder:

&#x200B;

I'm an idiot.

I don't know Calls.

I can't even spell Poots

I don't know how the stock market works.

Or how to use the word it's properly. Its too difficult.

I'm just analytical as fuck and love patterns, statistics, and probabilities.

This is not financial advice.

\*\*\* Edit 1 \*\*\*

removed the world **People** and replaced it with ""**Large players**"" (I do not want to imply Apes are buying Calls in mass)

\*\*\* Edit 2 \*\*\*

First off... major Props to the moderators of this forum. I have to report (or memorialize) what I just experienced on r/ WSB (I posted this there hoping to get the information to more people) and it blows my mind. I can only draw one conclusion from this, but I'll let you all draw your own... within 3 minutes of posting (likely less time than someone could even read the whole thing) I had 10 positive comments such as ""oh another one, awesome let me read"" and 10 negative ones, mostly in all CAPS as if they were watching my name (likely from my post yesterday that got me noticed) that were immediately calling this BS and fake information. Anyone who commented under those comments asking what they meant, was then attacked. In the next couple minutes I noticed every positive comment get downvoted to -8 (including my own) and the post itself go from 250 upvotes down to 102. By 10 minutes after posting a moderator on WSB took the post down. When I asked why.  (keep in mind it's the same text you're reading here - with the only difference being Edit 1 above (one word changed to two words)) The reasoning provided for removing this post from WSB was:

*""telling people to buy options so they can all hold and make money is bordering on pump and dump, you can do a technical analysis and look at the technicals to explain why you think people should buy it. But telling people to buy it so you can all hold borders onto territory where SEC would not like it.""*

Hmmm... fwiw, if you read this, and think I'm implying you should buy call options, I'm not. I'm not telling anyone to do anything. Just shining a light onto something I see, and trying to explain the significance of it, in my own words. None of my words are meant to push anyone to do anything. Anyway, I wanted to capture this experience in this edit. This, in my mind is clear confirmation that this is hitting a nerve. It's information that people don't want out there. Stay healthy Apes. Care for one another. We are all trying to make the best sense of this data, in our own ways. Much love to you all!

\*\*\* Edit 3 \*\*\*

The best way to combat shills, is with humor. Had to share, because I went back and I couldn't stop laughing at this one that someone caught (was deleted a few minutes after).  I hope u/Pyzlos got to keep that Gold -- if not, and you read this, post something here and I got you. 💎🙌🦍🚀🌕

\*\*\* Edit 4 \*\*\* 

PSA: Continue to keep a close eye on what the media, and anti-GME squeeze posters have been saying (and I'm not talking about simply the people who think the squeeze won't happen, plenty of them are just applying logic, in their own ways)... I'm talking about the obvious agenda driven suppressive forces around here, stopping the flow of information. You'll see that certain categories of posts that are otherwise rational/logical are receiving various levels of defensive and aggressive responses, beyond what a rational counter debate would give... in my eyes, this is the clue as to what's actually going on, it's our only peak behind the curtain at Citadel. 

In poker, we call this a tell... **play the person, not the cards**... kind of thing. I think one of our biggest weapons in this fight is observing what the suppressive powers are focused on (I'm not talking about this post... certain other theories really seem to be shaking the media and opposition to their core). When you notice that, keep a closer eye.

Yesterday I was getting pinged all over this thread, let me make it clear.

This.is.a.bug.

For the people a little more familiar with the stock markets, this stuff is old as hell, I mean they probably haven't upgraded their systems since windows XP.

Blackrock changed and renamed some of their ETFs, and the system isn't handling it well.

JKI is an ETF name that's no longer active, it had no GME in it as far as I can tell.

# Gme Crashing yesterday

so as most of you have seen, gme was crashing yesterday with about 30ish%, but we didn't have enough volumes at those times actually give us that low of a price so... what gives?

Ah my friend welcome to the fucked up life of a stock owner.

If you look at the ETF's at that some time they were getting shorted into oblivion.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tkqh31i275p61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec36e50706767022b24d3cf55e91aaa7e65ab3a3

And at the same time the dip happened (and some a little before) we started seeing the usual FUD campaign by the media

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/7xykb8p675p61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=35199e5e4f2abea062b79531955fa03b0024cca6

So taking these things into account, lets take a look at some indicators, mainly the OBV

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mchty9/gme\_technicals\_obv\_showing\_little\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mchty9/gme_technicals_obv_showing_little_real/)

as to quote from the op:

I'm looking at OBV on GME. For smoother apes, OBV adds the volume on up-ticks and subtracts the volume on down-ticks to create a relative (i.e. its absolute value means nothing) indicator of buying/selling.

&#x200B;

Now it seems that the price has been disconnected since the spike in January, what does that mean? it means everyone is HODLing and right now we have a disconnect between a lot of price indicators and the actual price. This in turn could point to blatent market manipulation.

well we just have to wait right? yes get the dip and hodl is still the best strategy we have.

But we seem to be forgetting one simple thing, twitter. it was the weapon for the ex president of the usa and he was only one single dude.

Maybe it would be good to write ALL the SEC people on twitter, remember we have a lot of numbers on here and if 1 person says something it may get lost to the void, of 200k+ people tell them to do their jobs, that's a different story.

But right now it seems that the price is not reflective of it's worth, meaning that the price is being suppressed by nefarious methods via ETF's and OTC pools.

&#x200B;

Now are OTC pools the same as ""Dark"" pools?No

[pic of OTC](https://preview.redd.it/3tbu7i51a5p61.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=476c42391dd1cbc8700d7fb43bc4b758430a3a04)

I'll let a smarter person explain this :

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcrfak/alexis\_goldstein\_response\_on\_finra\_otc\_nonats\_data/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcrfak/alexis_goldstein_response_on_finra_otc_nonats_data/)

Alexis Goldstein gives a response and explains what's what.

&#x200B;

But let's circle back to the FTD DD ([https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/))

We have been seeing a lower SI right?

Ok let me try to get a wrinkle here and please work with me.

what if shorters are using synthetic longs to simulate they are returning the shares they are borrowing for shorting?

This would result in (1) lowering the SI% and people would think the squeeze probability is lower (2) this means they could have claimed that they had ""covered"" their positions with the house of finance hearing because they ""covered"" the open positions with synthetic longs (kicking the can further down the road) and because those positions where ""closed"" the SI would decline, meaning they could continue with synthetic/naked shorting.

This plan is kindof getting screwed because:(1)   GameStop officially said in their 10K that more than 100% of the float is shorted  (be it if they're speaking at the end of the fiscal year or current)

(2) the new NSCC and DTCC rules

With this they have lost this plausibility and their ability to produce more naked shorts becomes limited, or at least it enters a notably more dangerous territory. Consequently, they are starting to have trouble returning the stocks they borrow because they cannot print more to simulate they are covering them. If so, SI interest will start to go up (there was a \~3x increase yesterday), and it would potentially lead to disclosing the shitshow they have dig themselves in.

I'd like to give thanks to u/whatever_username_ who messaged me about this and this makes perfect sense to me, because the fact that it's getting harder and harder to do what they have been doing also coincides nicely with the switch to OTC.

And also why the numbers of ""borrowable shares"" has started declining bit by bit, so much so that from 12 yesterday afternoon the rest of the day was stuck at around 0.

so the FTD's are getting F'ed in the A.

# Why is GME so silent?

ok I've been seeing this one pop up quite a bit so lets go into some business 101.

First of all if you look at the letter RC ventures and GME signed which gave Ryan Cohen 19.9% of all stocks, Ryan Cohen is not allowed to speak on behalf of the company or buy more shares until 2022.

So RC can't officially speak on behalf or regarding GME right now, but seeing how much of the current board is changing and that almost all the ""old blood"" will be gone by June's shareholder meeting, this silence period of his may be (hopefully) shorter.

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822844/000119380521000031/e620202\_ex99-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001822844/000119380521000031/e620202_ex99-1.htm)

Why is GameStop themselves so quiet?

Easy most of the board is leaving, so this means there have been lots of closed door meetings and a lot of things will change because of these meetings.

If you have a background in business you know, this is something that needs scalpel precision not a sledgehammer.

so expect them to implement changes and to hear about it later, GameStop said it themselves in their 10k filing that they are fiscally healthy enough to not need to release bonds, they're healthy enough to NOT need to raise capital even right in the middle of transforming a company, THATS INSANE!!

seriously normally when some company goes through a transformation it needs money, so it releases a roadmap so investors may see their tendies and want to invest. this time... nah we got enough cash to do this we don't need help we got this fam.

So expect GameStop to suddenly SHOW what they have changed instead of going ""this is what we will change"". the first method is way more bullish imo, it shows vision and courage.

# Death Threats and harassments

So as some of you may have read on u/heyitspixel's twitter, he has been getting death threats and getting harassed.

Unfortunately Both Pixel and I have been getting loads of these and let me be clear about this, I won't stand for harassment, be it against me or other users, know that we have both contacted reddit for this and we are both filing police reports concerning these threats.

Idc if it's just trolling or actual threats, but we are both not taking this lightly and neither is reddit and the police.

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

One last thing before I go, I've seen people complain about ""what if the price go's down back to 40/45/50?"", I'll double maybe even triple my position, at this point I personally feel it would be extremely undervalued at 40/50 range.

So if you're worried of the price going down you must be new here or don't know a lot of what's been going on, so relax, read all the DD you can and you'll feel fine.

The best weapon against anxiety in business is competence.

Edit 1:

For all you smooth brains who recently transferred to new brokers, contact them to make sure your shares are not being lent out. it seems Fidelity is doing so, so if you don't want them to use your shares to short, contact them

(this used to be about fidelity but contact your broker regardless to make sure they treat your shares the way you would want, if you don't want them to be borrowed out tell your broker and make sure, dont assume)

Similar to Pixel upon release of my first DD I was sent threatening messages and my IP/VPN was attacked with tracking software. I have had 3 additional accounts banned from reports and IP tracking software. I believe they were most concerned about what I am about to release to this community now (I released a similar version of this DD to my private group).

Whenever looking at a massive war as a spectator I always look at who has most to benefit and lose from the situation. I believe this is what our Bloomberg terminals show us quite clearly:

**Shares vs Shorts - Blackrock/Vanguard vs Citadel/Susquehanna**

Most of the other names on the shares/options side of this stock are either directly or indirectly connected to one of these 4 major funds. However, this story does not begin with GameStop - in fact - GameStop is simply where it most likely will end.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K239Z8YzWI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K239Z8YzWI)

**Tesla**

The war between Blackrock and Citadel/Susquehanna came to a culmination point around this stock in particular, but in this situation they found themselves on opposite sides of the trade:

Taken directly from Blackrock’s Wikipedia page:

## Global warming activities[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BlackRock&action=edit&section=12)]

Despite BlackRock's attempts to model itself as a sustainable investor, one report shows that BlackRock is the world’s largest investor in coal plant developers, holding shares worth $11 billion among 56 coal plant developers.[\[82\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock#cite_note-82) Another report shows that BlackRock owns more oil, gas, and thermal coal reserves than any other investor with total reserves amounting to 9.5 gigatonnes of CO2 emissions – or 30 percent of total energy-related emissions from 2017.[\[83\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock#cite_note-83)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XVCc5zwPlU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XVCc5zwPlU)

What stock serves as a great threat to the largest coal/oil investor in the world? You guessed it, EV and Solar.

Blackrock went short on Tesla along with most of the traditional wall street firms. Citadel and Susquehanna super accumulated shares and options to go deep long:

[https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/citadel-advisors-llc#tabholdings_tab_link)

10% of Citadels holdings are in Tesla options

Citadel CEO Ken Griffin has ownership through company entities, including the hedge fund, a total of 7,864,059 Tesla shares. That’s a 4.3% stake in Tesla.

[https://whalewisdom.com/filer/susquehanna-international-group-llp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/susquehanna-international-group-llp#tabholdings_tab_link)

11% of Susquehanna holdings are in Tesla options

Susquehanna International Group, Llp has filed a 13F-HR form disclosing ownership of 2,203,701 shares of Tesla Motors, Inc.

Susquehanna, Citadel, and retail ultimately slowly squeezed Blackrock out of Tesla resulting in an approximate 550 billion dollar gain (rocketing both of them into top 10 funds worldwide). The gain in their portfolios in 2020 is staggeringly large (30-45%) and almost directly congruent to Tesla’s rapid stock rise.

What does the #1 firm on wall street do when they get squeezed? They squeeze back:

“Sir, I’ve found a subsidiary of Citadel named Melvin has been shorting the shit out of a low float brick and mortar named GameStop. They even installed snake board members and are planning on bankrupting the company due to bond defaults at the end of 2020.”

To reform a corrupt board/company takes 2 things: voting share majority and a kickass CEO:

In 2011, at the age of 25, Cohen founded Chewy under its original name of MrChewy.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-lima-5) Cohen says his inspiration for picking the pet category came from his experience shopping for his [poodle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poodle) Tylee.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-forbes-6) He cites his father Ted, who ran a glassware importing business, as a mentor.[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-verdon-7)[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-rcohen-8) In need of capital, Cohen says he originally approached over 100 venture capital firms and was rejected by all of them.[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-adams-9)[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-dahlberg2-10) In 2013, Cohen secured the company's first outside investment from Volition Capital for $15 million.[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-cohen-11) By 2016, he had raised capital from investors including [BlackRock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlackRock) and [T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T._Rowe_Price).[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-zaleski-12) That year the company had $900 million in sales and had become the number 1 online pet retailer.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen#cite_note-armental-13)

Getting the picture yet? Blackrock helped Ryan Cohen not only capitalize his company for an online takeover, they also assisted in his sale to PetSmart AND listing on the NYSE. The same year Blackrock invested in Chewy, it became the #1 online pet retailer. Back to GameStop - 9 million shares from RC alone isn’t enough for a voting majority or to oust a corrupt board (we saw the CFOs lame attempt to get RC ousted). But, when you combine Blackrock/Vanguard/RC’s voting shares you get damn near half the available float.

Fellow apes - we are not running with a whale or even a kong. We are riding on the back of KING FUCKING KONG - the largest investment firm in the entire world, Blackrock. So as you continue your screeching and slinging of ape shit, do so with bravado and confidence knowing we are backed by the biggest fucking ape of our world. Godspeed space travelers.

Ok so for the people who missed the debacle yesterday let me recap it here real quickly.

Yesterday a good DD got posted, in that DD was a link to a pdf, the pdf was fine, the problem however lied with the website that the pdf was hosted on.

This website had some extreme political views, and because of that we don't allow it.

the mod team consists of people from all walks of life, and we try to respect everyone from every aspect. one of the ways we do that is making sure we don't support any form of discrimination, sexism or misogyny.

Everyone is welcome here, but people this is a sub about a specific stock, not politics or gender issues, so please keep to the stock.

The most important thing about this entire ordeal is that we learn to respect everyone, this is one of the many reasons why I've been trying to preach ""apes don't fight apes"". Because united we stand divided we fall.

that's why we won't accept any posts or threads that may in some way shape or form divide us.

Also if you think ""so what it's about the pdf not the website its on right?"" you'd be partially right but you need to think of the bigger picture, because right now how would it look if this goes on and a news site does an article about us (or another sub for that matter) can you imagine the headlines?  
""Dumb money associated with extremist website"".

So please realize that this is something small that can turn into a big problem later down the road, we try to walk a fine line between allowing everything that's ok and not censor people and having a healthy sub which they wont take down.

The same thing goes for the new hires of GME, yes they are amazing but reaching out to them and fanboying is not going to help us, making threads objectifying them even less so. so for the love of god guys have a sense of decorum.

Now onto the news.

# April 2nd

On april 2nd (this friday) the stock market will be closed, this is because of good friday.

&#x200B;

# Truffle shuffle

Today will mark the end of the first quarter, meaning that Hedgies will have to respond and show their books both long and short  It's simple, shorts need the price as low as possible, trying to hide short interest, or FTD, or any of that shit is irrelevant today. and juxtaposed with that is for the long positions, they need the price to be as high as possible.

Also I've heard that today an hour before close the ETF's are rebalancing, meaning we could see something happen, I'm not saying liftof, I'm saying it will be interesting.

Remember we don't do dates, and the hedgies will try to lie as much and as hard as possible to get their tendies, they'll lie, cheat and scam their way to their fourth yacht.

So keep your expectations tempered about this.

#  The naked shorting scam revealed.

Ok so onto the naked sections

[This was the good DD from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/) The bad link has been since removed, now I know what a lot of you are thinking ""But Ren, those rules are old"" and you'd be a 100% correct, the thing that's interesting to me is not that the rules have changed since then, but more the methodology used.

Kenny started learning in the 80's and made his company in 1990, this means that the tricks he most likely knows are the old school ones, and those are the ones we are seeing today, can't teach an old dog new tricks right?

Well the DD in itself is good but we need a few wrinkle brains to look into this, because if that one checks out it would work really well with [this](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/) DD and and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mf1f6n/i_was_missing_a_key_piece_of_the_puzzel_this_is/) one.

I think that we may have found Achilles' heel 

This would in turn work well together with low availability of shares, the big FTD numbers, the glitches in TOS and the max pain theory. 

Max payne? no not the videogame idiot max pain is the sweet spot in the middle of the puts and calls, this means if we stay in a sweet spot where they expire worthless, we help Kenny dig his own financial grave.

Because if you look at all the puts, calls and options there are a lot very low and a lot very high, but in the middle there aren't a lot of them. so that's the point where the stock uses ""max pain"" and this dries the hedgefunds bit by bit. and this is why patience is key, we can stay retarded longer then they can remain solvent.

now this also means that the well has to dry slowly for this to work right?

well thank you  u/33a as he did a chart of the available to borrow shares.

Now remember these are numbers from Iborrowdesk and these don't account for all of them but it does give a good indicator as to what's happening

This is insane. Not only does GME have by far the fewest number of shares to borrow, but the fee is almost nothing. It's hard to get a sense of how far out of whack GME is with the rest of the universe from numbers, so HE made a chart to help visualize the gap:

On the X-axis, we have the normalized available shares, which is available shares to borrow / float. On the y-axis we can see the borrow fee. I had to make this **LOG SCALE** in order to be able to even see anything due to how distorted the numbers are with GME. There is a general trend that as the available borrow shares goes down, you see borrow fees go up (though some stocks have generally more shares and may be more liquid, affecting these numbers). We can see that TKAT's borrow fee is quite high at 543%, given that there are almost no shares available to borrow right now.

*But LOOK AT GME!* GME has even fewer shares available as a percentage of its float (they even ran out last week), and yet the borrow rate is almost 0. This is so out of whack that clearly something crazy is going on. I consider this strong evidence of some kind of collusion between the banks lending shares to manipulate the borrow fees for GME. There is no way that the fee should be so low.

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

Can we call (Whales) them Kongs?

Yup, Whale  🐳  now =  Kongs  🦍

***Edit 7:   People seem to think this is FUD:  I wrote this premarket at like 9AM and had not even the slightest clue that it would somehow blow up.***

***I noticed shares were missing this morning across GME and all ETFs which I have been trying to track.  I wrote this to just make sure people were prepared if we see another sell off and not to worry if there was a dip.***

***The reason I think this is important is because if we tank tomorrow  and more puts are in the money...it can gamma squeeze the other way.  I'd much rather people be prepared ahead of time at the possibility of there being a drop because of the amount of shares borrow and what shorts may have been gathering up themselves to do a massive drop, than have unprepared people freak out and paper hand today or tomorrow.  I'd much rather know a dip was coming and be prepared for it.  Rather than be shocked like on 3/10 when we all of a sudden had 7 breakers trip and people weren't sure what was going on.***

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not a super long message but just some understand what might happen today.  Anything I post now almost immediately goes into the 80% because bots/shills so try to get this in front of people ASAP because they need to know not to freak out.

*\*\*I'm not 100% on this but please someone correct me or inform us if this is correct.  To my best understanding, today is the day that options contracts have to be bought by Chicago if executed.  This would mean they want as many options out of the money as possible.*

***\*\*\*\*\*\*\* MOST IMPORTANT PART\*\*\*\*\*\* Expect this part:  They took out close to 2 million shares new shares to short with ETF's and this would not include ones they might have been buying on the open market with a different broker where they are ""long"" with that broker. To explain, say you short with 7 different brokers but the 8th broker you start buying 2 million shares long.  To that 8th broker, you (The Hedge Fund) are long so if you decide to slam bid a sell off (Meaning you don't wait for price improvement within the bid, just sell no matter what the price=Red Waterfall), now there is nothing fishy to them. To them you were long GME and just wanted out of your position, but the other 7, it helps your overall short position.  So you lose 200 million on one account but gain billions back on the other 7 accounts.***

\*\*SEC when you read this, make sure you note what I'm saying....you know....rather than look at the Citadels of the world who are literally breaking laws in front of your faces.   But yeah, make sure you research me a guy down to his last pennies that he's put into this stock.  I just like the stock.

&#x200B;

**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*This means that even after they trigger a SSR, they will have another 2 million ETF shares to tank GME with after they are on SSR\*\*)   This might make people think retail is selling off.  So they could have between 2-5 million shares they have been accumulating to make today look super ugly.  This combined with their high frequency trading, bid slamming, etc.  I completely expect they will slam the stock down in the next two days to make sure that the 160 200 up are out of the money\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\***

The shorts can't afford to keep having options turn into shares and keep going higher each week.  If you are on Robinhood, switch to cash TODAY if you want Robinhood to be forced to locate your shares if you are afraid to switch your account.  This would force Robinhood to actually buy your shares instead of an IOU which they are likely holding instead.

**EDIT:  10:40AM \*\*\*\*\*\*\*NEW information for Robinhood Users:**  [**https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7jhp4/time\_to\_launch\_the\_rocket\_this\_is\_the\_catalyst/**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7jhp4/time_to_launch_the_rocket_this_is_the_catalyst/)

They are saying this would force Robinhood to actually buy your shares instead of an IOU.  They seem to think this would be a catalyst.  Dunno but probably worth a shot and a read through.  I'm in the process of switching accounts with them.  So if this rockets to the moon now because of this and I'm still switching, pray it stays up for a while lol.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just want people to be prepared if there is a dip.  The long ~~whales~~ Kongs were not with us yesterday \*\*(Edit:  This does not mean I think Kongs are out.  I think they are waiting for something)

I personally think they want the shorts to reshort again and they want to keep this out of the 200s coming up on Tomorrow (Friday 3/19) since there is talk that some of the Shorts might have 200, 300, and 400 dollar calls which expire also tomorrow which they hedged weeks ago.

Pinning it lower than 200 would fuck the shorts the most since they would lose their hedge bets as well, then the long ~~whales~~ Kongs would proceed with buying up long again.  This was a theory I read  [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m584h0/how\_i\_see\_the\_gme\_end\_game\_playing\_out/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m584h0/how_i_see_the_gme_end_game_playing_out/)

He thinks ~~Whales~~ Kongs are waiting out this week because they want to keep the shorts from getting their hedge bets then will proceed next week.  I'm not putting dates at all but that would explain why ~~whales~~ Kongs seem to be MIA this week.

The other catalyst could be earnings coming up on March 23rd.  Not saying this is a date but something like good news could bring large institutional investors.

After Earnings, GME could start talking about what they are doing for future plans.  I think they are gag ordered because of earnings which someone just confirmed in the comment section!

Please get this in front of people so they know what is going on today and tomorrow!

🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀 💎🙌🏾💎🙌🏾💎🙌🏾💎🙌🏾💎🙌🏾🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**TLDR:**  Not FUD just wanted Apes to be prepared if their was a sale.  **Just Buy and Hold**.  Heroes of GME mentioned in Edit #5.  Yup, Long Whales  🐳  = Long Kongs  🦍.  Tomorrow can gamma squeeze either way.  Explained how shorts could be picking up shares long (Then mass sell them off) then sell them at a magic time like on 3/10.  ETF's can be shorted even if SSR is triggered.  Think the Long Kongs 🦍 are waiting for something, could be earnings or tomorrow.  Not sure.

If you can better summarize, I'll post it and give you credit lol

All credits go to  [u/Animasoul](https://www.reddit.com/u/Animasoul/). Their account can't post in GME just yet because of age.

**TLDR** \- the effect of short selling on a positive-beta stock will be to give the stock a negative beta. Otherwise, in normal situations, there cannot be a negative beta stock because it is only theoretically possible, not actually possible. What is GME's current beta? Depending on the source:

Financial Times: -1.7413

Yahoo Finance: -2.07

Nasdaq: -2.09

**UPDATE: BLOOMBERG currently at -8 (Insane.)** [**https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6mje0/gme\_beta\_from\_bloomberg\_and\_ownership\_update/?utm\_medium=android\_app&utm\_source=share**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6mje0/gme_beta_from_bloomberg_and_ownership_update/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

**At 16 March 2021.**

This is CRAZY. I am currently writing my dissertation for an MSc in Finance and Financial Law. I learned in Corporate Finance that a negative beta stock is like a mythical unicorn, so when I noticed a few weeks ago that GME's beta was -2.01, I interpreted this as some sort of perversion around what is happening with the stock right now but did not understand what it really meant. I have since been investigating this in my own time instead of my actual dissertation topic and this is what I have found - that short selling can create a negative beta - and now GME's beta has fallen even more to as much as -2.09 according to Nasdaq.

**Background theory - IMPORTANT**

What is beta? Beta is a number that reflects the correlation between the price movement of a stock and the movement of the overall market. We do not have the data of the ""real world market"" so the ""market"" of GME is going to be the S&P500. Basically the ""market"" is the universe in which we and all stocks exist. That is why a negative beta is normally not possible. It is like saying that a certain species of animal will thrive and prosper the more the health of the Earth as an environment deteriorates. Yeah, it could happen in an abnormal situation, like an atomic bomb and the cockroach population coming out the winner, but it is not something normal as we all depend for our growth on the market/the Earth.

A beta of 0 means that there is no correlation between the market and the stock.

A beta of 1 means that the stock moves exactly the same as the market, e.g. if market is up 10%, the stock is up 10%.

A beta of more than 1 means that the stock amplifies the market's movement by that much, e.g. if market is up 10%, then a +1 beta stock would go up, e.g. 15%.

A beta of -1 is a perfect negative correlation, so the stock moves exactly the opposite of the market, e.g. if market goes down 10%, the stock goes up 10%.

A beta of less than -1 means this negative correlation is amplified, e.g. market goes down 10%, stock goes up 15%.

An easy online source:

'Negative beta: A beta less than 0, which would indicate an inverse relation to the market, is possible but highly unlikely. Some investors argue that gold and gold stocks should have negative betas because they tend to do better when the stock market declines.'

[https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/](https://www.investopedia.com/investing/beta-gauging-price-fluctuations/)

**About GME specifically**

Here is the historical beta of GME from Zacks:

02/28/2021 -2.195

12/31/2020 1.404

09/30/2020 1.084

06/30/2020 1.038

03/31/2020 0.4512

You can see that GME's beta has only been negative since end of Feb 2021. Before that it had a very normal beta of over 1, meaning when the market was doing well, then its business did well too, i.e. people have money to spend on games, etc. Even during most of the lockdown its beta was still quite a bit above 1. But at the end of Feb, it suddenly went all the way down to -2.195. What happened at that time? The massive crash down to $38. Plotkin himself said that the rapid rise in price was not due to shorts covering right? But have they covered since one way or the other? The beta would indicate no because now the beta is even lower, at -2.09. Since Yahoo confirms Nasdaq, I think the FT is sus and in the best case just doesn't update its data. -1.7413 is still remarkable though.

Here is a quote from an academic source by Fabozzi - the author whom I credit with helping me the most to prepare for my Corporate Finance exam - anything he writes is gold and written very clearly with no academic posturing or arrogance:

'So far the implications of systematic risk have been ignored. The beta of a short position is the negative of the beta of a long position, and is hence normally a negative number. In the capital asset pricing model, the required rate of return for an investment depends on the correlation of the return from the investment with the other securities in the portfolio, a characteristic that can be measured by its beta.'

[http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/\~straf/allow\_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf](http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/~straf/allow_listing/fabio/fabio3.pdf)

See also this author:

'Although the data used in this research consist of net short positions and the tax regulation in the Netherlands is different from USA regulation, a small negative beta is expected to account for end of the year, tax-motivated short selling.'

[https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer\_MA\_MB.pdf](https://essay.utwente.nl/66633/1/Klamer_MA_MB.pdf)

Both authors mention this very casually and by the way because it is so obvious to them. Logically, if the true beta is, say, 1.4 then its beta when shorted must be a negative number. This is very significant for apes who like GME because they keep telling us that there is no more short interest, here's the data, etc. but they can't manipulate the beta. I don't know how the beta is calculated by these news outlets but I think it must be done automatically by the bots and even if FT were a shill and not simply inaccurate, the beta of -1.7413 is still crazy.

For comparison, this academic says:

'Every time I have found a negative beta in practice, there was either a data error or the sample size was too small for the negative beta to be statistically significant...But now there is an interesting real life case of a negative beta stock: Zoom Video Communications, Inc....A better example of beta changing dramatically (going from around two to negative and then back to around two) within a few months without any change in the business mix of the company would be hard to find. ***Negative betas may be a once in a 100-year event \[emphasis added\]***.'

[https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/](https://jrvarma.wordpress.com/2020/08/23/negative-beta-stocks-the-case-of-zoom/)

To me, this is all very strong evidence that the shorts have not covered and are desperate. Due to the absence of reporting requirements for short positions and the other myriad and innovative ways that HFs may be shorting GME that we cannot see, no one has hard numbers for the actual short interest in GME, but ***the beta cannot lie***. Since HFs have been shorting GME since forever and the beta was still more than 1 even during the pandemic, it must have been safe for them ***so long as a large number of investors were not buying up GME and holding***. I am planning another post summarising what Fabozzi says about why, under realistic assumptions, optimists set the price, not pessimists (i.e. short sellers).  


**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS -** *I know this is a very long DD but please check the edits if you have any questions. I notice that most of the new questions are variations on the edits.*

**EDIT 1:** To clarify because it is coming up in the comments, a negative beta which is less than -1 is not very unusual and it means that the stock is resistant to a market downturn but doesn't actually go as far as doing the opposite of the market, i.e. -1 or less. But -1 is considered not to exist, although academics never like to say never.

**EDIT 2:** Also in response to comments - a negative beta does not mean that the stock never ever goes down when the market goes up. It is a general trend and is also only backwards looking - it doesn't predict what will happen. If things change the beta will recalculate.

**EDIT 3:** The overall market does not need to crash for GME to go up. GME's true beta is around 1.02. That's why the negative beta strongly indicates short selling. Until the beta returns to normal, GME is probably still being short sold. I am not promising the moon apes, although I hope for it. This is all just maths, we don't know what will actually happen, we can just make our own best decision and then we have to accept the outcome of our decision. But I am personally 💎🤲

**EDIT 4:** If you would like to know the beta of any stock, you can easily google this. Financial news websites like Yahoo will give this to you for free under the price chart. I also found beta figures on Nasdaq.

**EDIT 5:** My future post summarising Fabozzi's research on why, in realistic situations, optimists set the price and not pessimists will offer an explanation of why the previous short selling did not affect the beta and why short selling looks like it has increased sharply as reflected in the very negative beta since apes started diamond handing. I also work and am not only a student so this might take me some time but I think it is super important, I was also floored when I read this and want to share with other apes.

So long story short 💎🤲

LET ME START WITH A QUICK INTRO: SO WE ALL KNOW HOW HF ARE HIDING THEIR SHORT POSITION.

Actually, even the SEC knows, since they wrote a ""risk alert"" on it in fuck\*\* 2013.[Strengthening Practices for Preventing and Detecting Illegal Options Trading Used to Reset Reg SHO Close-out Obligations](https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf).

# LET ME SUMMARISE THIS RISK ALERT FOR YOU

&#x200B;

**How do HF manage to make it look like they covered? Easily, with 2 types of deceptive options trading.**

&#x200B;

1. A buy-write trade, i.e. selling deep ITM call + buying a synthetic long share from MM
2. Buying a married put: buying an option put with a synthetic share.

&#x200B;

**What's the difference between selling calls and buying puts?**

Well, not much, it's a question of obligation vs possibility, but in our scenario, it does not matter much.

&#x200B;

**Why buy a synthetic long at the same time as the option?**

They use the synthetic share to appear as if they ""close"" their short position. Pouf FINRA number goes down, Bloomberg writes an article ["" GameStop Short Interest Plunges in Sign Traders Are Covering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/gamestop-short-interest-plummets-in-a-sign-traders-are-covering)"" saying the HF have covered, end of the story.

&#x200B;

**How can they buy a synthetic long?**

if a market maker buys options from an options writer, the market maker has legal privileges to do a version of “naked shorting” as part of their hedging function. This is necessary, under the current rules and the current system, for market makers to protect themselves when facilitating options trades.

&#x200B;

**Do buying synthetic long have an impact on the price of the stock?**

Well, I do not think so, since they are not part of the float, they are not purchased on the market.

&#x200B;

**It it good news or bad news?**

Well, we are not sure. There is a theory saying that the FTD cycles are getting bigger and it will only get worse for them, but I don't like the wait and pray tactic when we're dealing with HF. To me, it's rather a bad news to only rely on HODL and pray for the MOASS to start without the regulations in place to force short to close their positions.Their deceptive options duckery means they can reset their FTD indefinitely, the close-out requirement (which will trigger the MOASS) will never be enforced, and we are fucked.They are not bleeding as we thought they were. The SEC papers mention that with this tactic, they do not have to pay the borrowing fees for shorting, just a pre-arranged premium with the MM, which can be seen as a cost to leverage the MM hedging prerogatives of naked shorting.

&#x200B;

**Who is short then, the HF or the MM?**

As long as the double trade is done (buy-write or married put), the HF are no longer short, fron a reporting standpoint, but the MM are, They usually don't want to stay short too long, so they most of the time exercise these options the same day. Which now makes the HF short on his turn, but with a reset for FTD.

&#x200B;

[Someone remember Melvin Capital revealing 6,000,000 Puts in the SEC filing from February?](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link) But no long position with their put, so naked puts. I'm willing to bet 1 trillion dollars these puts are leftovers of married puts he used as deceptive options to trade to look like he covered during the Jan squeeze.

&#x200B;

**The amount of such options that need to be traded is too big not to be noticed. They all know. The SECC, DTCC, any concurrent HF, and now even us.**

This is why I'm convinced our best chance is a regulation of Options trading. But that would be too much to ask, right? Well, the DTCC just made the best ""April fool"" joke to Citadel with [**DTC-2021-005**](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-005.pdf)**,** submitted after market close on Thursday (Have a nice Easter weekend Ken!)

&#x200B;

# How [DTC-2021-005](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-005.pdf) could be a GAME CHANGER

It seems 005 is both a change of wording in their settlement procedure guide as well as an update in their operational book-keeping procedure.

What they are introduced is an additional reporting field. A ""Status""  or ""system notation"" tracking on security. To track if this security is borrowed, used as collateral, or coupled with an option. This is brilliant. They may not need to involve the SEC at all because they are not regulating anything, they are just adding a level of reporting in the tradings they manage.

**Page 42:**

***Collateral loans***\*:\*

*The collateral loan service allows a Participant (the pledgor) to pledge securities as collateral for a loan or for other purposes and also request the release of pledged securities. This service allows such pledges and pledge releases to be made free, meaning that the money component of the transaction is settled outside of the depository, or valued, meaning that the money component of the transaction is settled through DTC as a debit/credit to the pledgor's and pledgee's DTC money settlement account. When pledging securities to a pledgee, the pledgor's position* *~~is moved from the pledgor's general free account to the pledgee’s account~~* ***continues to be credited to the pledgor’s account, however with a system notation showing the status of the position as pledged by the pledgor to the pledgee. This status systemically*** *~~which~~* *prevents the pledged position from being used to complete other transactions. Likewise, the release of a pledged position* *~~would move the pledged position back to~~* *the* ***results in the removal of notation of the pledge status of the position and the position would become*** *~~pledgor's general free account where it would then be~~* *available* ***to the pledgor*** *to complete other transactions.*

&#x200B;

***\*\*\* Collateral Loan Program***

*About the Product The Collateral Loan Program allows you to pledge securities* *~~from~~* ***held in*** *your general free account as collateral for a loan or for other purposes (such as Letters of Credit) to a pledgee participating in the program. You can also request the pledgee to release pledge securities* *~~back to your general free account~~*\*. These pledges and releases can be free (when money proceeds are handled outside DTC) or valued (when money  Page 42 of 45 proceeds are applied as debits and credits to the pledgee's and pledgor's money settlement accounts). A Pledgee may, but need not be, a Participant. Only a Pledgee which is a Participant may receive valued pledges.\*

***Pledges to the Options Clearing Corporation****A Participant writing an option on any options exchange may fully collateralize that option by pledging the underlying securities by book-entry through DTC to the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). If the option is called (exercised), the securities may be released and delivered to the holder of the call. If the option contract is not exercised, OCC validates a release of the pledged securities,* *~~which are then returned to the Participant's general free account.~~*

***\*\*\* Release of Deposits with Options Clearing Corporation on Expired Options****OCC automatically releases securities deposited with it to cover margin requirements on an option contract when the option contract expires.* *~~The securities are then allocated to your general free account.~~* *Notification of the released securities is received via the Collateral Loan Services functionality in the Settlement User Interface or automated output.*

&#x200B;

Could this mean no more synthetic long, FTD, and other fuckery? This could force the Reg SHO Close-out Requirement which will trigger the MOASS into Uranus.

&#x200B;

# I WISH I WAS A COW TO BE JACKED TO ALL MY TITS !!

&#x200B;

# TOO APE ; DID NOT READ:

If short sellers are facing a squeeze because shares are hard to buy, or scrutiny for holding an illegal short position, they can create an appearance of having closed their short position through the use of deceptive options trades. (Selling ITM call or buying married put).

It does not make them cover, just reset the clock so FTD doesn't skyrocket.

DTCC is unhappy about this mess and could be trying to ensure Options can no longer be used like this.

When it gets enforced, it could force a close-out requirement (force HF to buy the stock in the actual market, launching our rocket to the sun)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**EDITS 1:**

So, guys, I see lots of questions around when this goes into effect.I believe it's effective immediately after the SEC approves it.

How long does the SEC usually take to approve these fillings?WELL, SURPRISINGLY, NOT SO LONG! Could be even just a week or two.Here a brief history:

* DTC-2021-003 (Force HF to reveal their position on a daily basis): submitted the 09/03, approved the 16/03
* [SR-DTC-2021-004:](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings) Approved in a few days
* [SR-DTC-2021-003](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings) was approved quickly as well
* All the ones before are approved (before Jan 2021)

&#x200B;

**EDITS 2:**

This is not financial advice, but I've been told by French Apes that DTCC stands for ""Dans Ton Cul Citadel"", is that right?

&#x200B;

**EDITS 3:**

Please smart apes, come forward and help us make it stronger and more accurate versiom of this DD. I suspect the 005 will have MANY different interpretations, which would imply to re-work this DD.

&#x200B;

**EDITS 4:**

I added another important missing paragraph from the filling that really explains why it will regulate options. This filling is not really a regulation (which would explain why SEC won't need to review it), it's a bookkeeping tracking update (almost a software update). They are going to be more precise in their reporting logic. **They will tag synthetic longs as ""pledged"" with an option. So they link the synthetic long and the option together.** This is what's new in their procedural book-keeping method.

Edit 5:I was invited to speak about this DD on a nice Ape YT channel today.[Here's the video of him and me breaking down this DD if you're interested.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQrOk5Syzl4)

# Remember, he has options!

Ok so let's talk about the OG here, u/deepfuckingvalue.

This dude has 50k in options right now and it's his choice to either execute them fully, partially or not, knowing him I'm personally banking on him executing all of them, or ""going all in"" like in rounders.

Who knows the madlad may even double his position for all we know.

we won't know what he does or does not do until he shows us. so let's hope we get an update today, I know I'd love to see it and most of you would as well.

But do know, DFV will most likely not cause a squeeze, his options have been hedged a long time ago so unless this madlad buys even more...

# To big to fail

So anyone who lived through the 2008 crash can remember one thing, jim cramer's bear stearns video, and the Lehman brothers going down.

u/Captain_Omar did a great write-up on JP Morgan suddenly offering $13 billion in bonds [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mrm243/jpmorgan_to_sell_13_billion_of_bonds_in_largest/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

From the article:

>[JPMorgan Chase & Co.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/JPM:US) is poised to sell $13 billion of bonds, setting a record for the largest bond sale ever from a bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The longest portion of the [five-part offering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QRMBW8GQOFSW), a 31-year security, is expected to yield 107 basis points above Treasuries, according to a person familiar with the matter. The sale comes a day after JPMorgan reported strong first-quarter [earnings](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-14/jpmorgan-posts-investment-banking-fee-surge-while-loans-decline), including a 15% increase in fixed-income, currency and commodity trading revenue and a $5.2 billion release from its credit reserves. Rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is also [selling bonds](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/QRM8YZGENSW0) Thursday.The previous largest sale by a bank also came from JPMorgan, a [$10 billion offering](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/Q8UJIMDWLU6Y) in April 2020, the Bloomberg-compiled data show.JPMorgan is the sole bookrunner of the sale, and the proceeds are marked for general corporate purposes.

Soooooo does this ring any bells for anyone because for me it really reminds me of the banks in 08 having liquidity problems. and if they have been doing some shorting as aggressively across the board, and they did this to the treasury bonds as well... the dollar may face some trouble as when the treasury bonds go bust, so does the USD.

Again I can be misinterpreting the information completely here, but feel free to say so.

Also weird in the banking world, Head managing director of Goldman Sachs derivatives division handed her resignation yesterday.

Ok so it seems that RH is getting it's license revoked in Massachusetts, while at first this may sound awesome (as they should have their license removed across the board imo as they've shown repeated bad faith), this one however is not that great.

The reason for the Massachusetts securities wanting to remove their license is because and I quote:

""Robinhood encourages inexperienced investors to place risky trades without limits.""

So this seems to be a double edged sword, because I believe one should moderate these brokers (SEC WAKE UP CALL THIS IS YOUR 9 O'CLOCK!) because they do have ""gamification"" in there which should be removed, but it can be harmful for us the retailers as this could set a precedent to add more rules in for the retail traders (aka making it an even less fair market then it already is).

So as people where mentioning GME didn't have enough FTD's to even to fit in the FTD DD I did some digging.

129,Here is why AMC will hit $1000+ or even much higher,1622848198.0,"I already said it, and I say it again:

Just compare our situation to Volkswagen:

\- In 2008 Volkswagen (much much bigger than AMC or GME) was secretly bought by Porsche.

\- Porsche owned **\~74%** of all Volkswagen shares, while **20%** was held by the state (Niedersachsen).

\- Hedge funds shorted about **12%** of the outstanding shares

\--> only **6% of all shares left for trade.**

**In this epic squeeze,** prices reached more than **$1000.** Why? Because hedge funds had to buy back their short positions, at any price... AT ANY PRICE... I repeat: at ANY PRICE...

**Now, here are the facts about AMC.**

\- Retail investors, i.e. 2million Apes🦍,hold at least **80% of all shares** (360 of 450 million),

\- and the **hedgies sold \~22%** of the stocks short (\~100million shorts).

And apparently our numbers are increasing. I estimate, based on the current stock price, that we might own much more than 80% already. (80% was recorded before the rally on AMC began).

Long story short, we own the stock, and hedgies have to buy back from US at any price... AT ANY PRICE. $1,000+ , $10,000 or even $100,000 is possible. Sky is the limit.

And again, Volkswagen showed us: it can go easily and quite rapidly to $1000 dollars within a day.

**This could be finally it, the mother of all short squeezes (MOASS)!!!**

SEC will be looking into this. 

DO NOT listen to the news articles telling you to sell AMC. 

This is a tactic that the big SHIESTY hedge funds do. They invest in marketing to protect their shorts. The marketing will be to scare you into selling your shares. (Hedge funds that shorted AMC are losing roughly $6million per day (in interest) with the price at $60+ 

Roughly 80% of AMC shares are held by retail investors 

If the SEC does a share recount(in June/July), the number of synthetic shares out there, the SHIESTY hedge funds will be forced to pay back their positions. Leaving us 80% retail investors controlling the price.

If you are holding AMC this would be a team effort for us retail investors. TO CONTROL THE PRICE!!

In Hind site we all need to hold our shares waiting to see what happens with the SEC investigation. 

If you are holding AMC get this message out/share to everyone you know who has AMC. (Don’t make a quick profit, make a lot with a longer hold)

Because soon you will see marketing to scare you into selling your AMC Shares. 
Why? Because they are already losing roughly $6million a day. (At the$60+ per share currently) Which would be roughly $180million a month. Hedge funds investing even $20 million into marketing, to scare you into selling 
!!!CAN PROTECT THEIR SHORTS!!!
So by getting us to sell it makes their negative marketing investment worth it. 

The smart play is to keep buying AMC every 
week/month what ever your finances allow until this investigation is completed.

The activity is continuing and appears to ramp up as the next FTD cycle approaches. The weird call interest appears to clearly correlate with rising price action and 'closing' of reported FTD volumes.

**UPDATE-2**: A new post that investigates how the scam could work with updated rules in 2021 is now online: [The naked shorting scam update: selling nude like its 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mh6lnz/the_naked_shorting_scam_update_selling_nude_like/)

**UPDATE**: This post was removed because the paper was hosted on an unfortunate website. This has now been corrected. I also want to point out that the sources used here are old, some rules have since changed. But read this and think if another version of this scam might be possible in 2021. Would funds be tempted to use such a scam for easy profits? Would desperate players be willing to break the law to hide short behaviour? I'll leave the answer up to you.

**TLDR**: Naked short selling privileges could be being illegally lent to short hedge funds by market makers. The married put trade and the even sneakier reverse conversion modification of the trade are described. These types of trade explain:

* how short interest has been manipulated in official reporting numbers
* how naked short selling has become so widespread
* why borrow fees can still be so ridiculously low
* that the vast majority of options (both puts and calls) might be due to naked short selling
* how short shares are 'washed' and able to be dumped on the market even during SSR
* why such a large number of way out of the money calls have been seen recently (actually part of a naked short trick, not long whales or gamma ramps)

Looking at open put interest *naked shorts sold might be at least 150-200%* of float!

With patience key options used for the manipulation will expire and the house of cards will collapse. Every time we hit max pain the shorts' pain increases. HODL!!

*^(Note: this is not financial advice. I am not a cat. I read some papers and made some interpretations. Any number of these could be flawed and wrong. Make your own mind up.)*

**Introduction**

One of the big questions surrounding GME has been about the reported short interest (SI) since Jan: *How is it possible that reported SI is so low when all other evidence suggests that SI is astronomical in GME?*

Another question we all have is: *Why the fuck is the borrow rate so low when there are no shares available to borrow?!*

Here I will try to answer these questions and how they relate to GME and the options market.

While looking into naked short selling I discovered a few great resources that I will use here. The main one can be found here: [2007.10.09-J-Welborn-Married-Puts-and-Reverse-Conversions.pdf](https://wetransfer.com/downloads/d2c6318f7953ae019390eddfd65b213820210330221314/51f103)

Here's a little bit of background from the paper:

>“failures-to-deliver” (FTDs) are, in effect, phantom shares that circulate in the stock market as real shares; just as counterfeit currency destroys the value of a currency, phantom shares deflate the price of a company’s shares. FTDs are generated using a variety of mechanisms. One is through abuse of the options market maker exception, which allows options market makers to short shares they have neither borrowed nor located in order to hedge. Abusive short sellers or hedge funds are illegally “renting” the options market maker exception to obtain phantom shares which can be sold into the market.

These phantom shares have flooded the GME market. In January reported SI was 140% meaning without any doubt massive naked shorting was happening in GME. Now we see that institutions own anywhere from 130-200% of available float once again showing that naked shorting is rife. Finally if we look at retail ownership of GME it could easily be 100%+ of free float. Estimates are difficult but many other great DDs suggest huge retail ownership.

Here is a quote from a [letter](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/sonecon010504.txt) former Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Shapiro forwarded to the SEC based on his own research into naked short selling:

>When the number of uncovered short sales in a stock exceeds its public float-or even the total number of shares issued or outstanding--the only plausible explanation is a concerted and illegal effort by short sellers to flood the marketplace with counterfeit or fictitious shares, in order to artificially drive down the stock's price and increase the value of the shorts. Massive naked short sales turn the equity market into a form of monopoly pricing for the firms that fall victim to such sales, in which the short seller sets the price at a level guaranteed to provide a quasi-monopoly return. These actions, in effect, destroy the integrity of the market system for firms targeted by naked short sellers and create a direct transfer of wealth from existing shareholders to the illegal short sellers. The firms targeted for such manipulation are generally smaller, younger public firms - the type of company which has generated many of the techno logical and organizational innovations that have contributed so much to the increases in business investment and productivity of recent years.  As relatively small and young companies with much fewer shares in their public floats than their older and larger counterparts, their individual decline or destruction also generally attracts little public attention.

Fuck these fraudulent fucks who sell phantom shares to put companies out of business. This time they have fucked with the wrong company because GME HAS A FUCKING SHIT-TON OF GLOBAL ATTENTION!

The shorts have never been faced with a horde of artistic apes who only know how to HODL, buy the dip and 💎🙌 till moon.

**How a hedge fund can fake SI numbers and sell naked**

One of the perks of being a market maker (MM) is that you don't need to play by the normal rules of FTDs and selling short. In the process of making markets, which requires hedging positions, market makers theoretically may need to sell stock they temporarily do not have. For this reason, Regulation SHO allowed market makers, “…\[an\] exception from the uniform ‘‘locate’’ requirement, as Rule 203(b)(2)(iii), for short sales executed by market makers, as defined in Section 3(a)(38) of the Exchange Act, including specialists and options market makers, but *only in connection with bonafide market making activities*.”

Although only MMs should have the ability to sell stock naked *it is possible to loan their privileges' to other hedgefunds to play short*. This image is taken from the linked paper and gives an example of naked selling for Overstock shares using a *married put* trade:

[Example of a married put for Overstock shares](https://preview.redd.it/lycx3rdas6q61.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=2043c8d6476829cc9aed81583e9402377412a563)

This could be, *and almost certainly is*, being done with GME shares to hide SI and avoid massive borrowing fees.

The option market maker obtains a market neutral position. Selling puts, alone, would create a net long position. Thus, in theory, the option market maker’s naked short sale hedges against downward price moves. The option market maker receives a premium for the puts. In the example above, most of the $5 is the fee the market maker charges for “renting” his naked short sale privileges.

After the married put is executed, the short seller then sells the “shares” into the market. Every time the short seller sells a share, his net short position increases due to the decreasing long position in the GME stock. The end result is that he is long puts on GME, which is equivalent to being short.

So it is possible to short sell using MM privileges with an options trick and avoid massive borrowing fees for hard to borrow stock. THIS IS ILLEGAL AND CLEAR MANIPULATION OF THE MM RULES!

In a 2003 SEC Interpretive Release, the Commission expressed concern about “*the manipulative sale of securities underlying a married put as part of a scheme to drive the market price down and later profit by purchasing the securities at a depressed price*.” With increased scrutiny on married puts, anecdotal evidence suggests that they are being masked within market neutral trades known as reverse conversions.

**How to hide your illegal married put: the** ***reverse conversion***\*\*!\*\*

Here is another example of naked selling for Overstock shares, now using a reverse conversion trade:

[Example of a reverse conversion version of the married put for Overstock shares](https://preview.redd.it/m7s0acsds6q61.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=2438f735745da62bd977b1ffa445d6ffdce4b062)

The addition of the the call sales masks the trade and attempts to hide it's illegality. However, a key point from the paper states that:

>Regulation SHO stocks with large, unsettled trades often exhibit a similar characteristic: ***“short selling” hedge funds with significant put holdings in 13F filings***

Now to take a look at Puts in GME using some other great ape DD.

**Options trading in GME**

We see a MASSIVE amount of PUTs sold for GME expiring on April 16: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfw3u4/huge\_number\_of\_puts\_expiring\_april\_16\_382k\_open/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfw3u4/huge_number_of_puts_expiring_april_16_382k_open/)

That is a possible 70% of hidden short interest that will expires in the options in a couple of weeks!!

Many of the PUT trades are likely to be the hedge funds' short positions from married puts. If they can expire worthless the hedge funds lose their bet and the MMs are left with a massive shit-ton of short sold IOUs to deal with.

If we look into all the put option interest for future months we might see the full scale of the married put naked shorting scam.

u/Cuttingwater_ took a look for me and found that if you tally up all puts <25$ (which just seem like write offs and would never be used) purchased for all available options dates, we are looking at > 150% of the float. That could be at least 150% of float sold naked! This number could be significantly higher as some options traded as part of the scam might have already expired.

208% if you include all puts OTM

In the case of the reverse conversion scam an extra call option is involved. For this version of the hidden naked short, the short hedgies are actually left with a way out of the money call. MAYBE THIS IS WHY WE SAW SUCH HIGH OPEN INTEREST FOR 800c CALLS IN RECENT WEEKS!!!

Every week we end around max pain we inflict more damage on the shorts: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mejp0k/the\_concept\_of\_max\_pain\_and\_why\_this\_is\_probably/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mejp0k/the_concept_of_max_pain_and_why_this_is_probably/)

Potentially the vast majority of options (both puts and calls) in GME could have been created as part of a naked shorting privilege scam. Therefore the longer we inflict max pain on the GME options, and the more patiently we HODL the more chance we have to ensure these fraudulent fucks are left with nothing.

All the recent DTCC filings suggest that they are covering their ass and looking into this bullshit before it explodes in their faces. Recent filings also mention that their aware of and ready to deal with option trading shenanigans by the MMs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mecfwi/too\_ape\_didnt\_read\_sec\_filings\_part\_two\_fuck/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mecfwi/too_ape_didnt_read_sec_filings_part_two_fuck/)

**Conclusion**

GME short interest is likely hidden in the options using manipulative trades that illegally allow hedge funds to borrow market maker privileges and avoid paying large borrow fees. Every week that we allow options contracts to finish out of the money the illegal naked short trades become more unsustainable. DTCC filings show that they are scrambling to avoid holding the bag. A larger hand (or whale flipper?) seems to almost always set us down perfectly around the max pain each Friday to drain the shorts...

A storm is brewing around GME. I'm just gonna keep HODLin' and buyin' that dip.

Edit 1: What if the Dark Pools are largely being used for the married put trades. To sell naked shares directly to the shorts along with their puts!!!

Edit 2: u/Cuttingwater_ helped look into the options and found this:

\>[@broccaaa](https://www.reddit.com/user/broccaaa) if you tally up all puts <25$ (which just seem like write offs and would never be used) purchased for all available options dates, we are looking at > 150% of the float>>208% if you include all puts OTM

I will add this to the main text. Could suggest that at least 150% is naked short sold. Other options as part of the scam could've already expired meaning this is a lower bound.

Edit 3: This also explains why SSR doesn't do much!! When MMs sell short to hedgies it 'washes' the short tag away. The hedges just have 'normal' phantom shares to dump at will!

Edit 4: ***This post does not point to any specific dates for a squeeze***. Options expiring hurts the shorts and drains their resources. The naked short IOUs still need to be paid but sit on the MM books. Any catalyst, gamestop related, DTCC related, or market related, could set things in motion.

Edit 5: This analysis makes so much sense to me but it is based on papers from more than 10 years ago! I know some rules have changed since then but don't you think another version of this loophole will have been found by these greedy fucks when this method has been profitable for so long?

Edit 6: The examples I give were for Overstock shares. The shorts fought for years to hide their naked fraudulent asses but they embarrassed themselves by filing evidence of their crimes by accident!

**Disclaimer:** This post represents my views and uses assumptions that may or may not be entirely accurate. Feel free to disprove in the comments. I am not a lawyer nor a financial advisor and nothing in this post constitutes legal or financial advice.

**Thesis:** I believe that the DTCC has been actively orchestrating the planned failure of the NSCC. I believe that the participants of said entities know about this because information would be published to them based on the Recovery & Wind Down plans that were recently updated. Not only do I believe that these participants know about it, I believe that they have set up global shell companies to avoid being liquidated in the event that the recovery corridor is unsuccessful.

There are multiple filings of very large global securities purchases on the DTCC website available only to participants with one thing in common: They are non transferable to persons or entities in the US. Look for yourself at the data from the DTCC for the Underwritings with restrictions in the subject.

[https://www.dtcc.com/legal/important-notices?pgs=2](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/important-notices?pgs=2)

If there is indeed a wind down of the NSCC, everything would be transferred to a ""Transferee"" who would manage the critical operations of the NSCC. The NSCC would then liquidate the positions of its defaulting members, its own LNA (Liquid Net Assets), Its Clearing Fund to include Supplemental Liquidity Deposits (SLDs), and then the rest of the obligation would be passed on to the remaining participants. (Maybe not in that order) However, That last part can't happen if that money is tied up in say...shell companies in the Cayman Islands with restrictions that don't allow transfer of those assets to entities in the US. I can't fucking make this shit up.

After that, the NSCC would file for bankruptcy under chapter 11 bankruptcy law.

**NSCC Rule Book** Rule 42

**DTC Rule Book** Rule 32(A)

Filings of securities issues from what I assume are largely shell companies or transactions to move money into more secure positions that cannot be transacted to non qualified buyers. Note: These may or may not be shell companies and the use of shell companies is not illegal in every instance.

I am going to have to get more into the connections of our current situation and how that relates to my thesis, but for now, I have to get some sleep as it is now 4 here and I have been researching this all night. All of the information that I have linked or provided is publicly available. Please feel free to repost on other subs and I look forward to any rebuttals. Let me be clear in saying that this is not an attempt at FUD; I hodl GME shares and I don't intend to sell.

**Edit 1:** I can't sleep now so fuck it. The Recovery and Wind Down plan of any of these clearing/trust companies is not public to my knowledge. I believe that they have a good reason for that, because if the public ever saw what they were able to do, they would probably be disgusted. I read the theory of everything GME DD linked here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mkvgew/why\_are\_we\_trading\_sideways\_why\_is\_the\_borrow/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mkvgew/why_are_we_trading_sideways_why_is_the_borrow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

I have reason to believe that the tactics that are being used to depress the price using shorting at massively low interest is directly because of the DTCC, DTC, NSCC through guidelines that they have in the Recovery part of the Recovery and Wind Down Plan that they have but do not have publicly published.

**Edit 2:** Removed DTC from the thesis statement.

**Edit 3:** Table 5-C lists the following NSCC liquidity tools: **Utilize short-settling liquidating trades**, Increase the speed of portfolio asset sales, Credit Facility, Unissued Commercial Paper, Non-Qualifying Liquid Resources, and Uncommitted stock loan and equity repos.

\- Footnote 13 from **SR-NSCC-2021-004** Table 5-C is from their non public R & W Plan

**Edit 4:** There are many comments asking if this would cause them to not get tendies. I don't think that what I have written here means that it is off. I think that the DTCC and its participants many be doing some very illegal shit if I am right and if so, it could put a cap on the squeeze because of the structuring of the NSCC and how it would wind down and stop losses at itself and its members (who may be using shell companies to divert fund out of the US). I am holding shares and I have no intention of selling, but I think that this should be reported if verified.

**b. Eliminating Form 144 Filing Requirement for Investors Selling Securities of Non-Reporting Issuers**

As noted above, the Commission staff estimates that approximately one percent of the Form 144 filings made during the 2019 calendar year related to the resale of securities of issuers that are not subject to Exchange Act reporting.45 The proposed amendments discussed above that would mandate the electronic filing of a Form 144 notice for the securities of an Exchange Act reporting issuer would reduce a large majority of the paper Form 144 filings that the Commission receives. Although one of the primary goals of EDGAR is to facilitate the dissemination of financial and business information contained in Commission filings,46 given the limited number of paper Form 144 filings related to non-reporting issuers that we receive, we believe that the benefits of having this information filed electronically would not justify the burdens on filers. For this reason, we are proposing to amend Rule 144 and Rule 101(c)(6) of Regulation S-T to require affiliates relying on Rule 144 to file a notice of sale on Form 144 only when the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

Please read this easy explanation. Not financial advice!,1616643553.0,"There is a lot of wonderful DD out on this subreddit, and a lot of wonderful apes that have realised that if the apes hold, they moon. It doesn't matter whether or not the price is dropping. However, it is a huge bunch of technical and advanced theories that is required to understand why the MOASS is very likely to happen even though (or because) the price is dropping.

&#x200B;

In this post I have tried to create an easy explanation of why this stock can take off so that everyone can get on board with reading the more technical DD.

&#x200B;

**Nothing I write in this post is financial advice. Don't use it to decide whether or not to invest.**

&#x200B;

Now to the explanation:

**SHORTING**

Lets say Gamestop issued 100 shares on the open market. This means that there are only 100 shares availiable in total.

&#x200B;

An institution called The Institution buys all 100 shares.

&#x200B;

Now a hedgefund called Shitadel think that gamestop stock price is dropping because of COVID-19. Therefore they borrow theese shares from the institution. They have to pay a fee every month to keep holding on to this share so the institution agrees to the deal. They also have an expiry date where they have to buy and deliver the share back to the lender (The Institution).

&#x200B;

Now Shitadel sells the 100 shares in the open market. They sell it for 10$ a share.

&#x200B;

Shitadels plan is to wait until the price drops so that they can buy the share back at a lower price. Lets say 1$. Now if they succed they sold it for 10$ and bought it back at 1$ before they delivered the share back to its lender The Institution.

&#x200B;

If this is the case then Shitadel won 9$ for every share they bought.

&#x200B;

This process is called shorting a stock.

&#x200B;

**SUPPLY AND DEMAND**

Now lets talk about the most basic economic theory on why prices increase and drop.

&#x200B;

Lets say you live in Norway. There is a lot of fresh water where ever you go. This means the supply is high.

&#x200B;

You have 10 bottles of water that you want to sell. The market is the 100 people living nearby. So you walk door to door asking if they want to buy a bottle of water. The answer is NO. Nobody needs to buy water, they can simply get water from the spring for free. This means that the demand is low compared to the supply. Everyone can have 100 tonns of water for free, so why pay for a bottle of water? It makes no sense.

&#x200B;

Therefore you move to the Sahara desert. You bring your 10 bottles of water and the new market is the 100 people living nearby. Now in the Sahara desert there is no water. This means thet the supply is very low. It is very hot so people living here really need the water. This means that the demand is very high.

&#x200B;

When you walk door to door and ask if they want water they will say YES! Then they will ask how much you charge, and you can charge a huge amount since the people living there needs the water. Lets say 5000$. If they dont get the water they might not survive. Therefore you can charge as much as you like.

&#x200B;

This is obviously highly unethical and should not be done. Give them the water for free. Don't be a douche. But it is a story that shows that when the supply is low and the demand is high the price will increase. This goes for Gamestop too.

&#x200B;

**NAKED SHORTING**

Back to our example.

&#x200B;

Gamestop issued a 100 shares.

&#x200B;

The institution bought them and lent them out to Shitadel.

&#x200B;

Shitadel is now waiting for the price to drop so they can buy the share back and deliver it to the lender for a cheaper price.

&#x200B;

Since The Institution owns all 100 shares of the 100 shares that are issued, we say that the institutional ownership is 100%.

&#x200B;

Since Shitadel borrowed and sold alle the 100 shares we say that the short interest is 100%.

&#x200B;

Now Shitadel feels certain that Gamestop is going bankrupt. If they do go bankrupt, Shitadel won't have to deliver the shares back.

&#x200B;

Therefore they use the ace in the sleeve. They are allowed to naked short a stock. This means that they sell a stock on the open market that DOES NOT EXIST, with the promise of delivering back a real share when the expiration is due.

&#x200B;

So Shitadel naked shorts another 100 shares. They sell it on the open market and get money. Then they wait until Gamestop is bankrupt so they dont have to deliver a real stock back at all. HAHA, they think. We will get rich.

&#x200B;

When they sell theese shares The Institution buys the 100 naked shares. This means that the intitutional ownership is 200% of the 100 real shares. It also means that the short interest is 200%.

&#x200B;

The best part is that when they naked shorted another 100 shares the price dropped automaticly since the supply increased and the demand was still the same. High supply + medium demand = lower price.

&#x200B;

Now the GME price is only at 5$. In the beginning it was 10$.

&#x200B;

This is wonderful, Shitadel thinks, so they do it AGAIN.

&#x200B;

They naked short another 100 shares.

&#x200B;

This time retail investors buy theese 100 shares (buying the dip).

&#x200B;

Now retailers own 100% of the 100 real shares. Institutions owns 200% of the shares. The short interest is at 300% of the real shares that gamestop issued to begin with.

&#x200B;

The supply is even higher now, and the demand is still the same. High supply + low demand = lower price.

&#x200B;

The new price is 3$.

&#x200B;

Shitadel is very happy. They have made the price drop a lot.

&#x200B;

All of a sudden Gamestop comes with horrific news. They have changed the board, they are doing extremely well, THEY WILL NOT GO BANKRUPT.

&#x200B;

Shitadel panicks.. They know they have to deliver the shares back to the lenders at some point. Because GAMESTOP IS NOT GOING BANKRUPT.

&#x200B;

Therefore they make an evil plan. They will drop the price even more so that people paninck and sell all their shares and Shitadel can buy them at a low price and give them back to the lenders.

&#x200B;

Therefore they naked short another 100 stocks. But nobody is selling their shares.

&#x200B;

They try again with another 100. But nobody is selling their shares. People are only bying the dip.

&#x200B;

How are Shitadel supposed to cover now? There are nobody willing to sell their shares.

&#x200B;

This means that the tables have turned. Shitadel has to get the shares back before the expiration is due. This means that the DEMAND IS HIGH! The demand is more than 100 shares. They have to buy back 500 shares and deliver them. But nobody is selling so the supply is SUPER LOW!

&#x200B;

What does this do to the price? Well.. The price will skyrocket.

&#x200B;

However the retail monkeys have to look at the panick naked shorting that Shitadel is up to. This brings the stock price down a lot. This is nervewrecking for the retail investors. But they know that Gamestop is not going bankrupt, so at smoe point Shitadel HAS to buy their shares back. And when the do, they are strapped in their seats ready for launch off to Alpha Centauri.

&#x200B;

In short: The more the price drops, the higher the price will shoot.

&#x200B;

Now.. This sounds unrealistic. Institutional ownership cannot be more than a 100%. It sounds like a fairytale. So lets take a look at a couple of stocks.

&#x200B;

Well.. I don't believe what i read in the news anymore. I dont believe the price I see on GME. The only thing I truly believe in is that the price of gamestop will launch to Alpha Centauri some time in the future.

&#x200B;

TLDR: When the price is dropping, the rocket will take off even harder!

[**TheUncleverestDev**](https://www.reddit.com/user/TheUncleverestDev/) **for pointing this out.**

&#x200B;

**"" If you read through all the institutions, Capital, Blackrock, and Fidelity all are counted number of times. This is because each company has multiple ETFs, Mutual Funds, etc, that make up various ""entities"" at each company. I.e. Fidelity can be broken down into 1) Fidelity Management and Research Company LLC, 2) Fidelity Management and Research Company, and 3) FMR Inc. 1) Might be comprised of Freedom Fund 2060, New Age Retail ETF, and Gaming ETF. 2) Might be comprised of Freedom Fund 2055, Russell 2000 Index, and FucktheHF Mutual Fund. 3)... you get my point. The idea is that each ""company"" can own different amount of shares of any company. For example, New Age Retail ETF own 100k shares of GME and FucktheHF Mutual Fund has 1M shares of GME. They are two separate entities in two different subgroups within the larger umbrella that is Fidelity. Don't forget that these ""shares"" are actually owned by individual people through 401ks, IRAs, or Individually. So it can definitely get confusing. But the moral of the story is that the numbers DO NOT GET COUNTED MULTIPLE TIMES. This means that Fidelity is literally holding 1.1M shares of GME, not just 1M with 100k being counted twice. OP is stating things properly.**

**Why they need to split up the company into multiple subgroups, is beyond me... probably to keep track of the hundreds of mutual funds and ETFs they manage. Most of these trillion dollar companies operate this way. Just bear that in mind. ""**

**EDIT2 : Naked shorting is not done out of thin air. They have to go trough a process of shorting a share that is allready shorted. You can read more about it on the link below. This is just ment as an easy explanation of the situation.**

&#x200B;

**EDIT3 :**  [**kylac1337kronus**](https://www.reddit.com/user/kylac1337kronus/)  **the kind ape saw an important mistake I have written in the post. Short positions don't have an expiration date. However, they can be forced to cover their short due to a margin call.**

&#x200B;

**When the price of the stock increases, the shorts have to put more money in to show that they are capable of bying the share back at the current price. Now if you shorted at 40$ and the price suddenly increase to 500$ you have to pay up and show the money. Or else, the stock will be bought back at the current price with force. This will increase the price further. The name of this action is a margin call.**

**EDIT5 :**  [**33a**](https://www.reddit.com/user/33a/) **the other kind ape pointed out another simplification in my post. This is the comment:**

&#x200B;

***"" At a high level this is correct, but you are missing a really big detail:***

***In order to naked short they need to be able to locate shares to borrow. The whole GME shorting trick is only possible if there are shares they can borrow, and to do this they really need retail investors.***

***I believe Robinhood and other memebrokers are trading out their customers and loaning out their shares for cheap to the big brokers like Citadel. Without this supply they can't keep shorting.""***",2021-03-24 20:39:13

Actually, 3 brokers sent their clients statements that they will be indefinitely banning short sales. THAT is huge!!

\- Also wanna end the rumor that AMC will do some sort of split or reverse split. Adam Aron, in his interview, looked right into the camera and committed to the fact that there will be no stock split of any kind AND, IF there was (but there isn't) WE the shareholders will have to have approved it.....

\- The stock price didn't tank yesterday because of the sale of 11.5 million shares, it tanked because of MANIPULATION.

156,BLOW THIS UP!!! NSCC-008 HAS PASSED WERE JUST WAITING FOR 002 HUGE CATALYST 🦍🍋🌑🚀🚀🚀,1620253811.0,"This isn’t mine I got this from the big amc subreddit 

I haven't seen as much talk about this, yet it is the biggest news to come and the endgame catalyst.

NSCC-801 Passed with no objections Tuesday.

For this rule to enter effect it needs to piggyback on NSCC-002, which if no objections are made again, will be passed this Friday.

Let me remind you just how powerful 801 is...

Once 801 enters effect, all hedgefunds holding short positions will be monitored every single minute. They will have to report every single minute their value in short positions versus their actual money on hand. If they fail to report or their short position value crosses the threshold where it is higher than their money on hand, it's an immediate warning to deposit the funds needed to cover within ONE HOUR. Failure to do so leads to the NSCC immediately overriding operations and liquidating the hedge funds entirely, one after another until all that is left is the trillions in insurance.

This is bigger than anything. This is so big, that this rule will prevent a squeeze even a fraction of this magnitude happening ever again. It is that powerful, and with its implementation at this stage of the game... good lord. The fact this isn't at the top of all posts is mind boggling. 

If NSCC-002 passes this Friday, we have entered the squeeze. Hedgefunds will be on a leash that gets tighter the more they pull. 

Starting in after hours and following into Monday, they will be under so much pressure and restriction that one of two things will happen:

Their ability to short will be at such a minimum level that our buying power will just break through their sell walls and the price will just continue to rise and rise until they can no longer afford to suffer the loss on their end and be forced to cover.

The other outcome would be strong final blows of sell off aggression and shorting, literally out of pure ignorance and recklessnes which will activate 801, and thus the great fall of the hedgefunds via margin call.

If 002 passes Friday, 801 will catapult us past relying on chart patterns, earning reports, share counts, and whatever else Adam Aron has up his sleeve.

This week is a setup beyond everything. Share holder meeting moved back to give confidence to hedgefunds to short harder until the earnings report on Thursday. This week is a setup and lowkey a bear trap to get the price as low as possible and then bring a ridiculous wave of new buying force after the earnings report with new buyers ready to eat up that final dip. All of this leading to 002 passing on Friday which would just destroy any uncertainty of a squeeze for AMC. 

To conclude, I want to remind you that 801 going into full effect not only relates to us... but the 100+ other stocks these hedgefunds have short positions in. If just one of those stocks like GME pull ahead because of 801 it will be a domino effect like never seen before. 

I am going to run through a wall Friday if 002 passes.

That will be the true beginning of the end.

Buy as much as you can this week. I expect the lowest price to be on Thursday around noon before the earnings report. Hold. You hold like this will never happen again in your life because if 002 passes I can assure you, that will be the case.

None of this is financial advice, this is all my personal opinion.

# wtf happened yesterday?

Ok so lets get a few things clear before moving forward.

1. this was not individual retailers selling off, this was a ""Flash crash"" [more info on it here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/flash-crash.asp#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20Flash%20Crash,minutes%2C%20resulting%20in%20dramatic%20declines)

We saw about 500.000 shares sold and no one buying.

2) this was premeditated, this was planned.

How do I know? because I was already saying this would happen for days.

plus some news outlets did a fucky wucky and posted this before the crash happened.

So like I said yesterday, they're trying to pull the rug out from underneath us and start to spread FUD. and they did alright, we had so many bots we kicked off the board since that happened.

Like clockwork the amount of bots and shills coming on just then and there where immense.

at the same time lots of trolls / hater/bots/shills came out on twitter to say ""I TOLD YOU SO YOU SHOULD SELL""

But it seems to me as I see the reactions of other people... yeah this is what is the thought across the board as they either claim this is impossible or have never seen anything like it.

# why was 350/400 so important to get it bellow that?

[u/AcedVector](https://www.reddit.com/user/AcedVector/) did a great writeup yesterday on why this price is so important for the shorts.

We all have been wondering for a while why now? why around this exact point did they choose to do this?

well remember those FTD's? they're fairly low right now right?

and also the Short amount went from 240% to what? 30%? ok so they hid this, the question is, HOW?

well it seems they took the ""kick the can down the road"" idea very literally, they hid them in in deep ITM options. give his article a read it gives a good explanation on how this works and how they did it.

for one his head is brighter than my future, second do you know who made laws so hedgies can't pull the same trick they did in 2008? this motherfucker.

He made the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, this law basically said oh you did what? swaps? these fucking things aren't regulated? one sec fam I got you.

And this guy spat in the face of everyone and just went and legislated this shit so hard that you probably haven't heard about swaps in a long time. he is known for giving zero fucks and doing what he thinks is right. not what the corporations think, no what HE thinks is morally right.

So yeah this is one of the few people in politics I like enough to share a beer with, maybe even a meal... call me Garry <3

# 100.000 a share

A lot of people have suddenly started talking about this being outlandish, funny how the fud campaign started yesterday with this, the flash crash AND the media all coming together, wtf is this Melvin's A-Team?

I'm gonna be very simple in a few of the most asked questions.

Q: Why would they pay it?

because no one else seems to want to sell for lower so they have to buy them.

Q: Who is going to pay me?

Just like when I sell my piece of shit car, Idc who pays me or how they get the money, this stonk is like my pos car, I set the price and they can get my shares for whatever I value them.

# Some tips:

Ok so I've noticed a growing fear of what we should do ""just in case reddit black out"".

So here are some tips about that.

first read this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2asru/death\_throes\_dd\_the\_secgovernment\_cant\_intervene/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2asru/death_throes_dd_the_secgovernment_cant_intervene/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

it's why the Government most likely wont intervene anymore at this point.

For me the easiest way of this would be saying... Twitter? my twitter is @ Rensole and I'll try to back up most of my work on external sites today, most likely tumbler or blogspot or something not sure I'll have to look into it but once it's updated i'll post it here as well.

**3) stop losses**

Do you have a Stop loss in? If your brokerage sells your information to people like Citadel, they knew where they were your stop loss was and they took advantage of it yesterday, so for the love of god remove the meme stop losses, just set your price to wherever you really want to sell and nothing else.

4) But how will they pay us?

Seriously shut the fuck up, if I'm selling my house, my car or even one of my crayons IDGAF where they get the money, so why worry now?

I don't care if they have to dig up Jesus and make that fucker pay.

it's simple, they need our shares, and I set the price for my own shares, and after yesterday it's no longer 100k it's more.

But is the company worth, shut the fuck up.

Either you believe in this and you're in this or you're out, and I rather have paperhands leave asap and leave this up to the Diamond Hands because then I don't have to deal with the same questions over and over, if you have a question ask, but FFS there is a search function, use it.

that's a big ass cup and handle

&#x200B;

# What to keep in mind today.

These assholes where quiet, too quiet for the past few days and they tried to kneecap us yesterday.

But the most important thing to keep in mind is simple, they tried to drop the price by as much as they could yesterday, and they couldn't. hell we even ended up 10% up in the green.

So expect them to try everything they can just like yesterday, expect fuckery.

&#x200B;

What's also good to keep in mind is the psychological aspect of this, as this is a war of the mind.

I've written 2 posts about this and linked them [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/lea7pg/the_psychological_aspects_of_all_the_things/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lemt4r/psychology_2_electric_boogaloo/)

&#x200B;

What you will also be seeing in the next days/weeks to come is a term called **""price anchoring""**

Price Anchoring is a simple concept, people say X price is good or talk about X price.

Let's take GME for example, anyone posting 1K as a good price anymore is either a bot a shill or a fucking retard, they are trying to make you comfortable with the 1k price so you'll be mentally conditioned to think ""oh yeah they said 1k was good right?""

so let's start throwing out some big numbers, my floor price is 100.000 and 150.000 this looks better than saying 100k or 150k, lets start using big boy numbers, that way when Melvin and Shitadel read this they can understand it.

the next few days are going to be turbulent, they're going to get rough, but I wouldn't expect anything less from them.

These are the death throes of a trapped animal, so expect it to fight back.

Expect them to do illegal things, expect them to try and get inside your head.

But most importantly don't forget that we are a community if you have troubles speak out, and other members if you see someone not understanding something, help them, give them resources and links so they can learn.

**Edit 1:**

**I'm noticing shills commenting FUD and quickly removing their usersname.**

**If you see a shill and tag me or one of the other mods, also include their user name so we know who to ban ;)**

Edit 2:

Set dates

Please please PLEASE guys, chill about the 19th.

Do not set hard dates, it will happen when it happens. We don't know for sure when the squeeze will be here, what will set it off or around what specific dates.

Remember this is a public forum and anyone can view this, so expect Melvin/citadel to have at least a few people browsing this.

Therefore do not think March 19th is a SET date, dates hold no value, the squeeze does.

So be level headed and expect fuckery, if everyone says the 19th (or any date) is the date you'll only be setting yourself up for disappointment, let this happen naturally. this is part of mentally preparing you.

Good morning everyone, this is an important update to what happened yesterday!

&#x200B;

**First of all**: Thank you for making my last post the most awarded and most upvoted post of all time in this sub!

&#x200B;

**Second of all**: I made a prediction in my post yesterday ([https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls830a/found\_the\_reason\_for\_the\_dip\_they\_are\_shorting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ls830a/found_the_reason_for_the_dip_they_are_shorting/)). The prediction would've become reality, if Hedgies didn't overshort with fake shares (more about that in a second). Why do I tell you this? I literally received death threats and insults when the market ended. Just a heads up: Those are PREDICTIONS, they can be faulty at times, especially when Hedgies do such unexpected things, that no Data can predict (again, more about that in a second). So please, for the love of god, don't harass me, insult me, or send me death threats when something like that happens. I understand your frustration, but don't target me.

&#x200B;

Now the juicy stuff; **What exactly happened yesterday? Here is a timeline:**

&#x200B;

**9:35 AM:** The market opened and we had a huge drop off in price and a HUGE spike in volume. Hedgefunds shorted over 18,363,000 Shares (over the first 5 minutes. The amount of shorting was so aggressive, that trading got halted twice within the first minutes.

https://preview.redd.it/m51fg65yqsj61.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a781e875df550646891bb0ef904ec70687a9c44

**9:45 AM TO 1:50 PM**: Trading pretty much went in our favor the whole time, people kept buying in, we hit the daily high of $185 at around 1PM and went sideways for almost 1 hour after that

https://preview.redd.it/c0pxh693ssj61.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=051eae15427a0d0669bfc2a3fbd6a5af0085adbb

**1:55PM**: Shit gets interesting. Really aggressive shorting for the second time that day brings the price down to $126. At that point in time, between 5,000,000 and 7,000,000 shares were shorted in the blink of an eye. What stood out for me at that point in time was, that the price kept going in the same direction after every short attack (between $100 and $125). That tells me, it was really important to get the price down in that direction. (more in a few seconds)

https://preview.redd.it/m6i81urqssj61.png?width=525&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9ec13415b59687b87955377f8a5aa2d2c1cbad

**2PM TO 3:25PM**: People buying in again, driving the price up to $140 - $150. And Now shit gets juicy.

https://preview.redd.it/z6l08otstsj61.png?width=1049&format=png&auto=webp&s=de9e19447a3e2592f131f6775e8b3957aad4c9b6

**3:30PM TO 4:00PM**: The 3rd aggressive short attack begins and keeps on going for 30 minutes, until the market closes. 10,000,000 shares were shorted in this time span.

https://preview.redd.it/4n20x2v7usj61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a1d7eb88de988d4a20608959a1ee36388cb807b

NOW THE ANALYSIS:

**WHERE DID THEY GET SO MANY SHARES TO SHORT GME AND WHY WAS IT NOT PREDICTABLE?**

So, how could no one forsee this? It's simple: Hedgefunds didn't borrow shares to short, they created them out of thin air. When the market opened yesterday, ALL available $GME Shares to borrow, were gone already (see my second edit from yesterday:  **EDIT2 (10AM): 0 SHORTS AVAILABLE FOR $GME RIGHT NOW. THEY BORROWED OVER 2,100,000 SHARES TO SHORT FOR YESTERDAY AND TODAY**! ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme); [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)) What does this mean? Well, no one can predict or analyse how deep they are digging their grave right now, because they are not using real shares to short GME. They can just keep doing it in order to hold the price down artificially.

&#x200B;

**WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE ADD UP TO SHORTS AND PRICE DIPS MENTIONED ABOVE?**

Now it just gets stupidly funny and obvious. If we add up the three big short attacks (18,363,000 right at opening, 5,000,000 to 7,000,000 at noon and about 10,000,000 right before close), we get 33,363,000 shares sold short over the day. Why is this funny and obvious? Check the latest FINRA report. It states that yesterday more than 33,000,000 were sold short. That's almost exactly the number that we get when we add up the volume of the dips.

https://preview.redd.it/ug52feyv0tj61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7287cc128ea9f04aa204932f13cd7b2ae00d44d

**WHY DID THEY SHORT GME SO AGGRESSIVELY WITH FAKE SHARES?**

Because bears are fuk. See, when GME would've closed in between $115 and $150, over 44.000 Call options would've become ITM. If exercised, that would've driven up the price AH/PRE or today in the high hundreds, maybe even thousands. Why is that so bad? The higher the price gets, the more calls get exercised (so called options chain), the more people jump in because of FOMO and we get closer to the magical $800 mark, where the MOASS would become inevitable this or next week.

https://preview.redd.it/7o8sfasqysj61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d12ce29c2f0d1c350052fbb4f39c8f37743753b

**WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM THIS LOOKING FORWARD?**

Hedgies don't give a single fuck anymore. Even when all the data available states, that there are no more shorts available to borrow for GME, we found all of their ETFs where they hid their shorts, they keep shorting it to try and stop the MOASS. You know what they say: There is nothing more dangerous than an animal that's trapped in a corner and's got nothing to lose anymore. That's what we're seeing right now. No one can give accurate predictions anymore, that is based on data. This has evolved into a game of poor greed and emotions. They don't care about the long term results of their illegal actions, they just want to save their asses for some more weeks or even just days.

IN SHORT: BE PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING, DON'T BE SCARED OF DIPS, THEY ARE MORE THAN LIKELY CREATED ARTIFICIALLY BY HIGHLY ILLEGAL SHORTING WITH FAKED SHARES!

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Hedgies are so fucked, that they just shorted GME with more than 33,000,000 non-existent shares yesterday, keeping the price down in order to stop the Gamma Squeeze from happening. The price would've jumped up to a few hundred, maybe even thousand dollars today if they didn't do it, which would've started the real squeeze today. They have nothing to lose anymore, so be prepared for more highly illegal action and don't get scared by fake dips!

**IN SHORT: I LIKE THE STOCK 💎🙌**

**EDIT(1PM EUROPEAN TIME**):  According to this site ([http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME](http://shortvolumes.com/?t=GME)), the short sale volume was 61 % percent yesterday, with a **short sale volume of 50,959,384. That doesn't mean that Hedgies opened 51 Million new short positions. I am being really conservative and sticking to the 33,000,000. If it's more than that, even better!**

https://preview.redd.it/c1w7yxrvbtj61.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=44b0aea7f19a50ad6a39f920cfdc4873852f063b

**EDIT2: TO ALL THE PEOPLE WANTING UNDERSTAND NAKED SHORTING / COUNTERFEITING STOCKS, HERE IS A GREAT READ:** [http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:\~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20this,the%20company%2C%20is%20considered%20counterfeit).

Quote: "" **Naked Short** — This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation – the lynchpin of this massive fraud.

Returning to our example, everything is the same except the part about borrowing the share from someone else's account: There is no borrowed share — instead a new one is created by either the broker dealer or the DTC. Without a borrowed share behind the short sale, a naked short is really a counterfeit share.""

&#x200B;

**EDIT3(9:30AM): THE FEE TO BORROW GME SHARES WENT UP BY 12 % OVER NIGHT AND IS THEREFORE IN THE DOUBLE DIGITS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 4 WEEKS! (**[**https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME**](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)**)**

&#x200B;

**EDIT4: How do I know that it was Hedgies and not Retail selling their shares?  It is possible, that some retail traders sold, but if you take a look at the Short volume (61 % yesterday with 51,000,000 shares being sold short) and then take a look at the overall sell volume, it doesn't add up. If there was a huge retail sell off and the additional 61 % short volume, the price drop would've been much much bigger. Most retail held through, therefore they had to aggressively keep shorting, because no one was selling.**

&#x200B;

EDIT5: I am preparing my next DD right now and HOLY SHIT. Yesterdays actions fit right into the pieces and I can give a date for the Squeeze to take place (ALMOST certain, but I don't want to make false promises, so please take it with a grain of salt!), because lots of different pieces fit together for that exact date. If I am able to finish it today, I'll link it here as well! This actually feels like a conspiracy theory, because everything happening right now points to that specific date making it feel too easy to be true.

&#x200B;

**Another edit to blueball you guys even more**: The crazy last-minute drive up of the price 2 days ago and the drop off yesterday and today were foreseeable in hindsight. Again connecting to that specific date. But that's just a theory, a Game(stop) theory! Just makes this whole shit crazier than it already is.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I HAVE ALL THE DATA.  YOU CAN'T MAKE UP HOW CRAZY THIS SHIT IS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOVIE! **THE ENDGAME DD IS BEING RELEASED TOMORROW @ 3PM EST / 9PM CET.**

# Fake reddit messages

Also something that seems to be cropping up is a new shill tactic of sending people on here fake messages acting like they are from reddit themselves.

Remember these are not messages from reddit themselves and if you receive these kinds of messages you should report them to reddit themselves immediately

Remember Reddit staff will never ask you to take any monetary action, or ask you to liquidate any holdings. because this is none of their business.

If reddit chooses to end your account or ban you, you'll get banned. its never followed with ""but if you pay X"" or ""if you sell X"" this is not how Reddit functions

Please take these emails for what they are, phishing attempts and trolling.

it's either a couple of idiots having fun, or a new paid shill tactic, however it's still scary to receive for some.

# WHY ARE WE YELLEN? LOUD NOISES

So as some people who where paying attention around 2010 may know there used to be a hedgefund oversight committee called FSOC.

(Financial stability oversight counsel)

This counsel was started during the Obama administration to asses the risks certain hedgefunds posed to the market, this was last used in 2016, and now out of nowhere, us Treasury Secretary Yellen announced that she is reviving it and immediately held a meeting about it.

# The Short problem

So I was also tagged in something which I don't know what to exactly make of it.

**Addendum: links removed because op was banned multiple times with multiple accounts at different times in the past weeks, pure ban evasion so wont link it.**

I have zero contacts in Hong Kong, let alone stand the FUTU Securities.

But I would remiss to not have mentioned this, due to FSOC being reinstated and the leniency that the banks had due to covid ended yesterday. meaning this could very well be true, but should not be treated as such until we are able to 100% confirm this one.

If anyone here has contacts there, please use them and help us stay informed if this is true or not, because this could very well be either true or a april 1st joke or a troll thing.

We don't know for sure.

But this expands, because I have seen other people post about how they also had trouble buying stonks in western brokers, but again we need confirmation on these things.

In the past week I've been seeing a lot of people talk about Archegos and what happened to them.

well our fellow ape  u/dontfightthevol did an article about it which you can find [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhe40h/what_happened_with_archegos_total_return_swaps/)

Give it a read because this explains how they where able to do what they did without having so much scrutiny.

&#x200B;

if you also weren't aware we are doing an AMA with Ms Goldstein this Friday

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhfxbm/official\_ama\_alexis\_goldstein\_friday\_april\_2\_11/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhfxbm/official_ama_alexis_goldstein_friday_april_2_11/)

Funny thing to mention surrounding this is that this is costing the banks billions, and guess what our favorite Dr Burry put on his twitter?

# Remember you have options

ok this has been said over and over, don't touch options until you know every aspect of how options work and how this stuff can impact you.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mha8v8/for\_the\_love\_of\_god\_stop\_buying\_options\_and\_doing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mha8v8/for_the_love_of_god_stop_buying_options_and_doing/)

at this point it's been stated so many times and people have not been able to discredit these explanations so I believe these hold merit to at least check out.

# Wen CEO?

Ok so some people have been asking (including me) why hasn't RC stepped up as CEO by now?

Most of us expected him to step up and be voted in before the earnings call or shortly after that due to Sherman was, quite literally, phoning it in.

well we seem to have overlooked something really important, namely vesting.

u/commentsonyankees did his first DD and we are thankful for that because well he thought of something we all overlooked, you can read his write up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhfqa2/current_gamestop_ceos_vesting_schedule_2_weeks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

The current CEO, George Sherman, is on a vesting schedule and due to receive roughly 84,000 shares on April 15th. The board could be waiting for this day before announcing Ryan Cohen as the new CEO. this would also line up with the date that the shares will have to be recalled for the annual shareholders meeting (not sure when these will be recalled but it will happen somewhere in april).

This is not to set a date for us, but this is the date for Sherman, he has incentive to stay on the board until that date, so it may very well be that there has already been some internal discussions and an agreement has been made with him to let him stay so he can receive those shares and then peacefully transition to someone else, hopefully RC.

And even if it takes until the annual shareholders meeting to be announced, who cares right? we are the generation that stood outside in the cold for hours waiting to be the first people who got their hands on Halo 3 at the midnight release, or COD or the new gaming rigs.

Remember we have more patience then you might first realize, just chill and let the good times roll baby.

# Think or Swim

Ok this is the news from last night from Think or swim app.

lets put these things in perspective

* Yellen says climate change is a problem for financial stability
* s&p futures go low
* FSOC is reinstated and has a meeting the same day
* US president to deliver remark on economic vision

I'm not entirely sure what kind of picture this is supposed to paint so I'll leave it with you guys to make up your own mind as always

# EXCELLENT!

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

We don't care, just be nice and lets make this community as Excellent as we can!

Remember none of this is financial advice, I'm so retarded I'm not allowed to go to the zoo 'cause they'll put me in the cage with the rest of my ape brothers.

**Edit 8 Unredacted:**

The answer to today's general movement was predicted in edit 8. I spotted large Call skew at 150 strike (unbalanced Call volume), then I saw a massive chain being setup between 150 and 180. I knew something was up and that this would fly.

**Edit 47 4:05PM:**

Wow.

**Edit 46 3:44PM:**

Choppy price action, we just saw a gap up at the minute tick. Aggressive shorting countered by aggressive buying.

**Edit 45 3:22PM:**

High volume on 120 strike puts. Bears fighting back.

**Edit 43 3:16PM:**

Thank you RC for the great summary of today:

**Edit 42 3:08PM:**

Remember they got tomorrow as well to fight for that 185 mark. This will get ugly as the shorts start throwing everything they have at this stock.

**Edit 41 3:04PM:**

We have a safety net at 155. This is a battle around 185 and if we can push through that and 200, it's literally a free for all charge to 220.

**Edit 40 2:59PM:**

Shorts are getting annihilated once again in the options market. Those measly Puts were bought in an attempt to control the tsunami that is pushing the price up.

**Edit 39 2:56PM:**

We've pierced through the 177 diagonal resistance like butter. Onwards to 183.5!

**Edit 38 2:52PM:**

Wall Street never thought retail would have this one simple trading power: holding.

For year's they've pumped and dumped several stocks using scare tactics to shake out all the paper hands. For the first time in history, retail finally managed to have the courage to completely invalidate all of Wall Street tactics through the sheer power of diamond. friggin. hands.

**Edit 37 2:45PM:**

I think Act 2 of this show is starting either later today during power hour, or tomorrow morning.

**Edit 36 2:41PM:**

**Millions of dollars of call volume still increasing at 180-200 range. This is not a bull trap in my opinion.**

**Edit 35 2:24PM:**

New ascending channel forming looking to retrace to 172.

**Edit 34 1:58PM:**

I'll call it the 177 diagonal resistance. Added to the list of supports and resistances.

**Edit 33 1:54PM:**

I'm seeing whales load up at the 175-190 strike right now. We'll likely see a temporary sagging until they decide to ignite the boosters again.

We're also challenging a new downwards diagonal resistance. If we break through this, we should be able to boost to the 183 range. Thanks to u/[CountGeeTee](https://www.reddit.com/user/CountGeeTee) for pointing this resistance out.

**Edit 32 1:36PM:**

Very tight battle. Put volume accelerating to combat long side. It's a close battle.

**Edit 31 1:13PM:**

Battle over making 172 a support.

**Edit 30 1:06PM:**

I believe this is an expensive fight over options goalposts. This fight can end either way, but I'm confident longs can win the war.

**Edit 29 1:00PM:**

DISCLAIMER. THIS FIGHT CAN END BOTH WAYS. THIS IS A BATTLE BETWEEN TWO GIANTS. We are merely spectators. Enjoy the show while it's running!

**Edit 28 12:49PM:**

Forgot to update, **two new horizontal lines added at 156.5 and 162.5**.

**Edit 27 12:39PM:**

Thanks so much for supporting me on Kofi! I've just purchased some additional trading analytics tools, and have also had a kind Reddit user provide me with some of theirs! I'm investigating the options activity more in depth and will keep you all posted on what I find.

General conclusion is that the Bloomberg Terminal is limited in usefulness. I will have to rely more on options scanners to get useful information.

**Edit 24 11:35AM:**

I'm swapping today's technical analysis completely over to options analysis. This is an options game right now.

IMPORTANT PRICE TARGETS:

145, 150, 180, 190, 250, 400. These are all prices that will be fought over. As soon as we cross one threshold, we'll be propelled to the next.

**Edit 23 11:33AM:**

My edit 21 in ape language. Many Calls make stock go BOOM.

**Edit 22 11:29AM:**

In my opinion, according to my data, the battle is on for the 150 mark. Prepare for some turbulence.

**Edit 21 11:24AM:**

That's it. The put skew just got annihilated. They've split the differential and the shorts have completely lost in the options market...

Ascending channel headed towards 172.

**Edit 18 11:19AM:**

Long whales are out for blood.

**Edit 17 11:16AM:**

If we hold at 150 into Friday, the delta hedging by MMs will potentially be huge...

**Edit 16 11:13AM:**

Call volume has doubled! DOUBLED!

**Edit 15 11:07AM:**

There is a tight battle being fought on the options market right now. Large quantity of OTM puts being exchanged, but Call options loading in at several ITM strike prices.

**Edit 14 11:04AM:**

THE TIDES ARE TURNING. My options scanner is going bonkers right now with the call volume.

**Edit 13 11:02AM:**

VIX up? Yes. B\_T\_C down? Yes. GME up? Yes!

**Edit 12 11:01AM:**

\*Begin playing epic battle music as I watch these little green candles wobble up\*

**Edit 11 10:50AM:**

I need to Redact my edit 8 for information purposes. My trader friends freakin out haha. Can't show the enemy what we know!

**Edit 10 10:45AM:**

There was a very interesting TA theory I saw a few weeks back, that we would see a pullback to the 120-140 region before we can climb again. I guess that theory is now valid!

**Edit 9 10:37AM:**

As the price is consolidating, I will take the time to sift through the Bloomberg Terminal and continue to identify any useful information. I've really learned a lot since getting my own Terminal yesterday and I think there's some interesting insights to be discovered.

**Edit 8 10:33AM:**

**\[REDACTED\]**

**Edit 7 10:25AM:**

**Bull trap or not, I'm still bullish on this stock.**

**Edit 6 10:21AM:**

Price settling into the 132.5-140 channel. Unknown institution bought in. Too bad Bloomberg Terminal won't have info on this.

**Edit 5 10:02AM:**

Huh... takeoff?

**Edit 4 9:54AM:**

**Part of that force is all of you HOLDING!**

**Edit 3 9:51AM:**

I hope you all understand the gravity of this situation. They shorted tons of ETFs yesterday to oblivion. They are doing it again, **dragging the entire market down, yet GME remains in the green.** A colossal force is keeping us above water.

**Edit 2 9:36AM:**

Moderate volume. 1million first candle on Webull (volume is reported slightly differently on different platforms). It would appear from some charting last night that **the 116-118 zone is one of the strongest support zones.** Today we will see if it can hold.

So I finally got access to my own Bloomberg Terminal. Spent a good amount of time examining all the data and it seems there's a lot more nuance to the data that what's available in the screenshots on Reddit. **It seems that ownership is actually slightly delayed, so please take my statement yesterday about long ownership increasing with a grain of salt.** I'll continue scanning through all the data, so stay tuned!

I am the head mod at r/GME. 5 months ago, I found this subreddit unmoderated and abandoned. I was its first member and I’ve experienced the tremendous growth of this subreddit first-hand, from r/GME gaining its first 10 members, to the first 100, all the way to the hundreds of thousands of members it has now.

You might not trust me due to the lack of content on my profile, and that’s understandable. I have always adopted a Laissez-faire approach to moderating, since I believe the r/GME community knows itself better than any specific person on the mod team, including me. That is why I try to minimize mod intervention whenever I can.

The recent drama going on with r/GME mods can partially be attributed to my inattentiveness. I do not use Discord and I have been busy recently due to family and personal circumstances that I will not go into. Needless to say, I wasn’t as up to date as I should have been regarding the situation.

I want to make it abundantly clear, I was not consulted regarding the removal of u/rensole and u/redchessqueen99. They were invited to the mod team when r/GME was still in its infancy, and their contributions have been invaluable to the success of this subreddit, both as moderators and content creators. I would have never let them leave on such trumped up charges, especially when they have seniority over the supposed mods who “voted” them out.

I can promise to you that as long as I am a moderator, r/GME will continue to be a platform for free speech and discussion surrounding GameStop stock as it was I established the subreddit at 0 members, the same values and sense of community which helped the subreddit grow to 100 members, 1000 members and now 200 thousand members and beyond.

The values of free speech and discussion around GameStop stock is what r/GME was founded on, which helped propel its rise into one of the largest subreddits dedicated to a single stock. I will never abandon those principles, as any deviation from those core values is a betrayal to my original vision of r/GME and a betrayal to all the members of this incredible community.

Recent Mod Removals and Reasoning:

u/YourNameIsC00L \- Excessive banning, inappropriate post removals

u/plumdragon \- Unapproved moderator additions and removals

u/0wl-Exterminator \- Invited without full mod team approval

u/Ya_Boi_Nezi \- Invited without full mod team approval

u/the_captain_slog \- Invited without full mod team approval

Note:

u/toasterrrr was temporarily removed as a mod due to him receiving death threats, and was re-invited back after deleting the crypto wallet link from his bio.

All of the remaining mods are people that I trust and have been here since the beginning; individuals who have dedicated their time and efforts to improving the r/GME subreddit without asking for anything in return. I can never thank them enough.

Final Note:

I have checked out r/SuperStonk and their mod team (especially u/rensole and u/redchessqueen99) are doing a fantastic job at cultivating a thriving community. I would highly advise all of you to join them if you haven’t already (I know most of you have) as they have some excellent content and DD regarding GME stock.

I believe transparency and communication is in the best interests of this community, so I decided to draft this statement. Forgive me, I wanted to post something earlier in the week but I was too shocked and disturbed to write an announcement, especially after seeing the sense of community I worked tirelessly for a half year to build get destroyed in the span of one weekend.

When I established this subreddit, I wanted to create a small but safe space to discuss GameStop stock without fears of being banned or silenced. Never could I have never imagined r/GME would grow to be this big, which is all thanks to you wonderful individuals. Just know that I deeply appreciate every single one of you for creating one of the most amazing and supportive communities on Reddit. Thank you.",2021-04-10 02:03:44

For one, I think that would help ensure that the price would go as high as possible due to this group of shares that never get sold no matter what.

I saw a post awhile back made by a guy who said he wouldn't sell ANY of his shares no matter how high the price went because he wanted to ""make it as hard as possible for you assholes"".

So he clearly doesn't like these dudes and we should help him out.

If you have 1, just get one more.   Especially if you're part of the one share army since you guys are the biggest group of the GME holders...and just never sell the bastard.

I think the best part of this is if everyone did that, we would not fear all the shares getting sold anyways since we all know we will always hold on to 1.

Sorta like a safety net or something.

My last thing I wanted to touch on is if I were you I would NOT sell any shares on the way up to ""cover my investments"".  This will maximize the rise if we ALL hold to the top and THEN start selling.  Apparently we'll have days to decide even on the downtick after the squeeze, so no worries about time.  So holding 1 share forever and waiting to sell at the top combined is the best way to cover our ass and maximize gains for everyone.  NOt fInACial adVice",2021-03-06 06:25:33

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here I lay out an in-depth analysis of order types, order types are an important part of a HFs strategy. Exchanges actually market different order types as a means for attracting business, but alas - they are suseptible to being misused.

I actually went down this analysis path in an attempt to prove the TD TOS volume from [why the $115 Billion buy order was not a bug](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcu6et/why_the_115_billion_buy_order_was_not_a_bug_do/), but also happened to find another extremely interesting tidbit

Let's get started.

First, we need to understand a few things which will give some context to this. As we all know GME is listed on the [NYSE exchange](https://www.nyse.com/index). What you might not know is that the NYSE exchange is comprised of different exchanges:

* NYSE
* NYSE Arca
* NYSE National
* NYSE American
* NYSE Chicago

The best part about this is NYSE started to release reporting on order types early last year, which allows us to **analyse the % of different types of orders being placed.** You can probably see where this is going…

NYSE Chicago is the most interesting because:

1. It has the lowest volume of equities being traded \~5-20m per day (compared to NYSE 1b+)
2. Due to this it’s easier to see how trading strategies emerge based on the order types used
3. Our beloved friend Shitadel is based in Chicago

The following analysis is formed on the basis that Shitadel, being a market maker based in Chicago, likely deals with the majority of the NYSE Chicago's exchange volume. Therefore assuming any patterns we identify is actually them.

# Delving into NYSE Chicago Order Types

The table below shows us the % distribution of these high-level order types for the past 6 months. We can observe that between Sep-20 and Oct-20 there was a monumental shift in order behaviour that’s remained the same to our current date ASWELL as the slow increase in % of Non-Displayed Limit orders each month.

What happened between Sep-20 and Oct-20? GME started lighting the boosters for take-off.

&#x200B;

This is also when u/DeepFuckingValue started to see traction majorly gain in his posts jumping from around 3k upvotes per post up to 16.1k upvotes on Oct 8th 2020.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nmxhmhqo6dp61.png?width=789&format=png&auto=webp&s=c14550788477463e0e1e7c1a03c51e732511b77f

# Understanding Order Types

Sorry apes, we're gonna have to get a bit technical here. Let’s understand this fancy order type terminology before going any further.

**Immediate or Cancel (IOC)** = An order to buy or sell stock that MUST be executed immediately. Any portion of an IOC order that cannot be filled immediately will be cancelled.

**Displayed Limit** = An order to buy or sell stock at or better than a specified price, these orders are visible to the public.

**Non-Displayed Limit** = An order to buy or sell stock at or better than a specified price, these orders are HIDDEN.

So what does this tell us based on the change in order behaviour of the NYSE Chicago? Suddenly there’s a shift away from IOC orders to Limit orders AND we’re seeing a huge increase in the number of HIDDEN LIMIT ORDERS.

Big whoop? What does this prove?

# Let’s go one step deeper

We have more order types than just the three above, they are just overarching groups.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/517tllfq6dp61.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=90edcf8f903def9f7c48e803bf098ad3a8c49cf2

Above we have even more data to play with. I’ve highlighted in yellow where we see the major shifts in % distribution.

In Immediate or cancel we see distribution shift to IOC ISO in October \[20.21% -> 40.95%\], within displayed limit orders we see a huge increase in Limit \[8.92% -> 19.73%\] and Non-routable limit \[6.32% -> 11.68%\] orders (all of these taking % share away from Limit non-routable IOC, which means the majority of orders pre Sep-20 were trading purely within NYSE Chicago). Lastly we have the steady increase in Non-displayed limit orders.

THIS IS WHERE IT GETS INTERESTING.

# IOC ISO Orders

[Intermarket sweep order](https://ibkr.info/article/1734)’s are generally a **large quantity** order that is sent to **multiple exchanges**.This is how it functions:

* An order is submitted in the pre market to sell at a price of 40.80 and is sent to exchange A.
* The best offer price on exchange A is 40.63.
* Exchange B receives an intermarket sweep order to buy 800 shares of the stock at a limit price of 40.88.
* The best offer price on exchange B is 40.88

*The trader that enters the intermarket sweep order would be required to fulfill their Regulation NMS requirement by executing the maximum available quantity on exchange A at 40.63 and then may execute the balance of the order on exchange B at 40.88 even though it is at a price that is inferior to the 40.80 order resting in the book on exchange A.  The 40.80 price is not the inside quote and is therefore not ""protected"" in terms of the balance of the sweep order executing at exchange B at a price of 40.88.*

So in monke speak, it fills the lowest alternate exchange price before filling the order at the higher price. Now, this is getting scarily close to what [u/I-had-a-Thought19](https://www.reddit.com/u/I-had-a-Thought19/) was theorizing about the HUGE TD TOS volumes of 634M @$182 in the following post. [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcu6et/why\_the\_115\_billion\_buy\_order\_was\_not\_a\_bug\_do/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcu6et/why_the_115_billion_buy_order_was_not_a_bug_do/).

The missing piece of the puzzle is how they control the price which leads us to our next two order types.

# Displayed Limit Orders and Non-Routable Limit Orders.

These are straight forward, they are visible orders which are placed to buy/sell stock at a particular price. Non-routable again meaning not changing exchange out of NYSE Chicago in this case.

These two saw a huge move in distribution come Oct-20 as well, previously sitting at <15% of volume, now representing 30%+ worth of volume.

I believe they are using a combination of IOC ISO orders with displayed limit orders to create the perceived effect of covering. Here’s the logic using the 634M @$182 as an example:

1. Set-up a string of Non-routable **sell** limit orders on NYSE Chicago
2. Set-up a string of limit **sell** limit orders on NYSE Chicago
3. Make sure what’s being sold are naked shares
4. Place a huge fucking IOC ISO buy order @$182
5. Hope that the IOC ISO buy order gobbles up all the naked sell orders, therefore making it look like they’ve covered. It might even gobble up some real shares as a bonus for them

There’s probably some intricacies at play there in terms of how they set-up the non-routable vs routable sell limit orders to get maximum bang for buck.

# THIS IS THEORY 1.

They place such large IOC ISO orders in hope they somehow trigger a chain reaction and try to cover as much of their short position as possible relative to the amount of limit sell orders they have placed to control it.

It all makes sense why we magically see such huge orders pop up, because they are shoving through ISOs which get shot out to every exchange that has GME listed and it has been likely happening SINCE OCTOBER.

This is also backed up through this quote from [IB](https://ibkr.info/article/1734).

*“Traders may see, on occasion, execution prices reported to time and sales that are at price levels through an order that they may have had working at the time.“*

They then keep using them as their regular order tool as it’s beneficial to try and sweep up as many shares as possible - only using it for the huge orders when they’ve got a good set-up in place. Kinda like how TA traders look for entry points, there are certain times when it’s better to go all in.

u/stormshawty \- fuck me up fam, I hope I’ve done you proud.

Do you think I’m mother fucking done though?

Hell no. Let’s move onto our last victim. Motherfucking Limit Non Displayed Orders.

# Motherfucking Non Displayed Limit Orders

Let’s start off with the chart below. These mofos haven't just been increasing on the NYSE Chicago but on every single other NYSE exchange since October-20. This shit is definitive proof that Shitadel and friends have been using HFT to manipulate the price of GME and I'll explain why.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa3vcasw6dp61.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=3aba013bc3407e898f16221d9f089ceff2c1ab42

A regular displayed limit order or IOC is visible to all us apes. They are also prohibited from locking or crossing the market?

WTF is locking or crossing the market?

If an offer for GME at $x is already on another exchange (NYSE Chicago), another exchange (NYSE National) cannot post a bid for $x or higher as it creates a locked or crossed market respectively. Another way to say this is, shit becomes out of sync, which ain’t good.

If someone tried to place such an order that I explained above, that order will be “slidden” until it no longer causes a [lock or cross situation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lockedmarket.asp). Slides are considered cancellations because of this and **will reset the timestamp associated with it.**

These regulations ensure that there is a bid/ask spread, guaranteeing the traders the cost of that spread in a size at least the minimum tick.

**BUT WHAT ABOUT NON DISPLAYED ORDERS???**

Calm down.

Hidden (Non-display) orders don’t have any of these regulations… This means the HFT (high frequency traders) can effectively jump the line by posting [“hide not slide”](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QmoFpdq9HeGJ-cdPP7y808uWxVufJNr2b69J0GY_-SQ/edit?usp=sharing) orders instead of visible orders. **This is because a hidden order will not be slidden, resetting the timestamp**. So if i placed an order in the scenario above at $120.01 for GME, they then place a hidden order for $120.01 as well, I get my timestamp reset as i’ve placed a locked/cross order, but the hidden order does not get their timestamp reset therefore essentially skipping the fucking line.

# THIS IS THEORY 2.

Monke speak: They get in front of the order book to benefit their HFT strategy of driving GME down in price so efficiently.

I’ve calculated the order volume from the Limit Non Display Orders - subtracting the “pre GME spike” %s (September as that's all i have) so that it’s essentially assuming anything on top of the Septembers' base % (the MoM increases in the chart above) are assumed to basically be GME related.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qwr05psy6dp61.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=94046d001fef927805d79348204db395d7139594

Let’s also checkout GME trading volume….

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0x9g79d07dp61.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed73d6565d8fa9d49d0eae8aaccdbf4518bda75f

Well, wouldn't you look at that, it’s actually reasonable that that monthly volume could have all been used in GME alone to manipulate its price for the past three months.

# That’s it.

Takeaways:

1. More evidence to support [u/I-had-a-Thought19](https://www.reddit.com/u/I-had-a-Thought19/) theory, in that they are using IOC ISO orders which cause the huge volumes we see come through in TD TOS feeds
2. In my eyes, definitive proof that HFs are using **HIDDEN ORDERS** in their HFT strategy to manipulate GMEs price.

Hopefully, I've added more fuel to your confirmation bias, because I sure as fucking have dumped a truckload on myself.

Poke holes into this analysis, question it. More than happy to have a discussion to see how this can further evolve. u/rensole, this be the DD i was referring to.

Edit: a word.

**Edit:** For people worried about hidden orders, and them just covering without us knowing. This is wrong. It's actually the best fucking point. They can't do this as WE BE A HODL'ING.

**Edit:**  To clarify ""covering their position"" They're walking a fine fucking line. They need to create the perceived effect of covering shorts but they're covering with naked shares (not real shares), so whenever they do this (theory 1 in my post) - they walk an extremely fine line between us walking away with the momentum and the price exploding and them being safe for another week. All we need to do is HODL to win once, but they need to win every single time they do this.

**Edit:** I'll be asleep during the AMA could people ask old mate on his thoughts about HFs using hidden order types to manipulate GME and how exchanges offering order types retail investors can't access perpetuates inequality within the stock market. Please and thankyou!!!

**Edit:** I love us. u/TendieTard commented an awesome [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kFQJNeQDDHA). Skip to minute 29 and watch for the next 15-20 minutes. It explains how order types basically skew the system towards those making the trades. This is real.

**Edit 1 million 4:18PM:**

**Seems Yahoo Finance and Webull lagged. It only just updated. We finished at 200.27, -1.48 and -0.73%. Still above 200.**

**Edit 100000 4:09PM:**

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/)

Closing price for today according to Yahoo is 202.44.

**Edit 69420 4:05PM:**

Volume right between 20mil and 30mil at about 25mil. So the average of my early morning and midday volume estimates. Guess the whales tapped out midday and came at the last second today to keep the price above 200.

**Edit 420 4:01PM:**

WOW. We spiked in the last 3 seconds and closed above 200!

We ended in the green today up 0.69 dollars and 0.34%.

Most of today's interesting action was midday from that large buy-in. We finished above 200 and I can affirm that we are still way above the 172 diagonal, and on track for another week of gains!

I hope you all have a good weekend.

Stay hydrated.  💦

Relax and have some fun. 😀

Next week will be certainly be another interesting week with the earnings call coming up.

**Some things I will be looking for in the earnings report:**

* Excellent sales from the recent console cycle
* GPU sales may boost earnings due to how quickly they are bought. However the limited supply may be a bottleneck
* **Sustainable new revenue streams**
* Signs of shifting to a higher margin business. Eliminating leases and other PP&E should help GameStop shift towards an e-commerce business model

I will read their 10Q financials and let you guys know my thoughts after the earnings call. Will post quickly if I see any red flags.

**I think what's most important is that GameStop proves themselves capable of achieving higher long term sustainable growth.** Just like how the stock is rising sustainably, the business must do the same. Even if there's a spike in short term sales, you need positive long term prospects to impress analysts.

**Edit 71 3:44PM:**

The sagging consolidation, by linear extrapolation of this descending channel, is headed straight for 200. Seems we'll end the day with a fight for 200. Long side will probably win.

**Edit 70 3:25PM:**

Hard to say what price we will end at, especially since anything can happen during Quadruple Witching day, so I will make a general prediction. I think we will end between 192 and 218. What's the probability of finishing above 200? 50-50 I think.

**Edit 69 3:14PM:**

Depends on the buy volume that comes in, but the red trajectories are more likely as MACD and RSI favor the upside.

Hehe. Edit 69.

**Edit 68 2:56PM:**

Small correction across VWAP. Volume a bit higher but still relatively low.

**Edit 67 2:42PM:**

Let's put this trading halt knowledge into practice.

Remember that for individual stocks, the Level 1, 2, 3 rule does not apply for individual stocks, only for an index like the S&P 500.

Last Wednesday, we saw halts at every large drop. We were halted for 5 minutes after each drop. **We weren't halted for the rest of the day because Level 1, 2, 3 rules don't apply for individual securities.**

&#x200B;

**Edit 66 2:40PM:**

Useful chart for understanding what time of the day = what threshold for trading halt.

https://preview.redd.it/cr8tes3751o61.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=75665382c801c5fb27c2046a20e5541bca30c969

**Edit 65 2:38PM:**

Oh my, AMC looks straight up like a penny stock right now. It's strangely stuck at a resistance line. Anyone know what's up with it?

**Edit 64 2:35PM:**

We're continuing a sagging consolidation as expected. We should see some volume pick up on or before power hour.

**Edit 63 2:30PM:**

**For individual stocks.**

>Under SEC rules, a stock is required to undergo a trading pause if the stock price moves up *or* down by 10% or more within a five-minute period. These rules vary depending on the price of the stock and whether it is a Tier 1, Tier 2, or other NMS listed security.

**Edit 62 2:24PM:**

Small clarification. The below rules are in regards to market indeces. For individual stocks, it's a bit different following the LULD rules.

**Edit 61 2:13PM:**

**When a (edit: index) increases in value**

Edit: The opposite of dropping. It's basically the same.

**Edit 60 2:08PM:**

The modern circuit breaker is a mechanism to temporarily halt trading on an exchange in an attempt to curb panic-selling. It can also be triggered from a steep buying rally.

**When a (edit: index) drops in value**

**These are the rules for a market wide circuit breaker**

**Level 1**

When the index drops below 7% of the previous day's close before 3:25PM EST, we get a 15 minute trading halt.

**Level 2**

If we drop further to 13% below the previous day's close before 3:25PM EST, we get another 15 minute halt.

**Level 3**

The last threshold is 20%. This halts trading for the rest of the day.

In the next edit, we will talk about how the breaker is triggered when a rally happens.

**Edit 59 1:58PM:**

After Black Monday, it became evident that certain market dynamics, such as a feedback loop of selling leading to more fear and then more selling, needed to be counteracted with changes.

Enter the circuit breaker. **If (edit: the market) plummets 7% within a short period of time, trading would be suspended for 15 minutes.** This helps reduce the problem of the rapid selling feedback loops.

In the next edit, we'll talk about how the modern circuit breaker works.

**Edit 58 1:57PM:**

This drop created widespread **fear**. A fear of higher interest rates and a seemingly endless 5 year bull run had led to selloffs prior to Black Monday. In particular, the Louvre Accord, an agreement to stabilize exchange rates and halt the decline of the US dollar, was one such catalyst for rising interest rates.

**Edit 57 1:49PM:**

On October 19, 1987, in a single day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 22.6%, the largest drop in a single day.

https://preview.redd.it/ugb49bl951o61.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=51f59f544b2ef0091d2bf4cfa16b1fe0b02666a0

The story continues in the next edit...

**Edit 55 1:33PM:**

Just a reminder that midday predictions are usually pretty vague as the volume is extremely low.

**Edit 54 1:27PM:**

For now, expect a sagging consolidation as buy volume is not back yet.

https://preview.redd.it/44czu83rs0o61.png?width=2140&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b02924080a15605e05e855543bf9ce9d329d5b5

**Edit 53 1:21PM:**

Regarding livestreams, I currently have classes occasionally so I'm doing this while in a Zoom call half the time lmao. I can probably do periodic streams after GME, but I can't stream daily as it's midterm month right now.

Word of advice for the younger viewers. Find some smart buddies in your classes and have them hit you up ;)

**Edit 52 1:18PM:**

Buy volume is missing. Consolidation and further sagging is more likely at this point.

**Edit 51 1:16PM:**

Option B it is.

**Edit 50 1:11PM:**

Volume flat. When the volume is flat, typically what happens is an upwards prediction will sag and transform into an extended consolidation period. I believe what's most likely right now is sideways or option B from edit 46.

https://preview.redd.it/62ghnmo9s0o61.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=03ff6613cf6f83dcee8db216d500bca293d347e9

**Edit 45 12:48PM:**

This is really impressive. No one is selling. This allows for RSI and MACD to reset and let us continue on our third leg up.

**Edit 44 12:45PM:**

Further speculation: They borrowed millions of shares this week. Possibly a large short attack midday today.

Too bad for the hedgies. We are immune to short attacks.

**Edit 43 12:44PM:**

Speculation: This could be a combination of MMs delta hedging, big whales buying in, RH buying real shares finally, and short coverings possibly triggered by XRT rebalancing.

**Edit 42 12:41PM:**

We're a bit too overextended. MACD favoring the downside. Some possible consolidation levels are 214.5, 218 and 222.5 if we manage to hold strong.

**Edit 41 12:37PM:**

Given how early the action has picked up, **I must increase my volume target to at least 30 million for the day**. Good catch by u/FDAz\*\*.\*\*

**Edit 40 12:36PM:**

Wow we consolidated briefly and now we're continuing our climb up! 222.5 is now a support level!

**Edit 39 12:32PM:**

Consolidation around 218.5 seems likely. MACD favoring the upside but RSI overbought. These mixed signals usually mean more consolidation.

https://preview.redd.it/wta6l8kbi0o61.png?width=2135&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0f306bcecc617a58dc36237b0efcdcdcd439478

**Edit 38 12:29PM:**

Volume ramping up again. Possible 2nd leg of the push? **218.5 and 222.5 are the next resistance levels.**

**Edit 37 12:25PM:**

Just a clarification on the sideways arrow. Bouncing at 204 is still sideways, because the regression line remains sideways. We're still moving sideways, but a 204 bounce may see the price returning to 209 and continuing the sideways trend. Given how strong I see the price holding, I think a 204 bounce is not as likely.

**Edit 36 12:21PM:**

I am thoroughly impressed by how strong this stock is holding above VWAP.

**Edit 35 12:14PM:**

I believe our 209 support will soon give way. Expect either a bounce on 204, or a bounce somewhere between 204 and 197.5. We're way overextended above VWAP.

**Edit 34 12:12PM:**

Shorts are desperate to keep this thing down. Available shares declining fast. They likely knocked it down from a 211.5 support to a 209 support. This is like trying to stop the Blitzkrieg with sticks and stones.

**Edit 33 12:08PM:**

All directions are fair game. Volume has settled down and now the price is attempting to find a support to consolidate on. **I believe the sideways arrow is most likely as MACD and RSI will return to neutral soon.**

https://preview.redd.it/awqdjc16i0o61.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=db89b59ac360dbd42191f624333ab91a05d7053b

**Edit 30 11:55AM:**

I'm gonna watch the rocket fly and see where it goes. Sit back. Relax. Enjoy the show.

**Edit 29 11:54AM:**

204 acting as a temporary support now.

**Edit 28 11:51AM:**

Seems like they timed this push with the S&P climbing. This causes the HFTs to go long biased and pump the stock up.

https://preview.redd.it/ofoasb24i0o61.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=89730f29fa71d7d0457816047d626ad409074a08

**Edit 25 11:44AM:**

A couple comments. First, I'm replacing the images below with a screenshot grouping the images together. This allows me to overcome the 20 image limit per post. You might think my charts disappeared, that's normal. Reddit is reprocessing the images.

Second, I'm using Webull. I use a white background because it's easier to see my crayon marks than on a black background. I have the default RSI, VWAP and MACD indicators turned on. These are 3 of the most popular indicators for understanding price action.

Lastly, I believe Cohen hasn't done a share recall, because he is opting for a controlled burn. Remember we want the price to climb sustainably to avoid any crazy downswings. By climbing slowly, we build **consolidation** and a **stronger support**, **making it next to impossible to short attack.** This is like a rocket. You need to control how much fuel you let out at the beginning, before the rocket can enter the stratosphere and go to the moon. I believe Cohen understands this basic principle.

**GME climbing slowly is a good thing. I believe it is currently on track to hit the stratosphere in the coming weeks.** Cohen might time the share recall when our rocket has entered Max Q and is ready to leave Earth. Timing it too early is dangerous for our rocket.

**Edit 24 11:36AM:**

I believe we are nearing a critical junction point. The 172 diagonal will intersect with the 192 horizontal resistance. I believe the price will mini squeeze up sometime during power hour and the price will jump above 192 acting as a support.

https://preview.redd.it/y4nemya2i0o61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=a225cde3646ede44b6c2de23e6bebb2256b8081d

**Edit 21 11:19AM:**

u/jiligalaxy good idea

The MACD and RSI strongly favor a 172 diagonal bounce. So option A is most likely.

**Edit 15 10:24AM:**

A comment about my speculation that shorts may use Calls to cover. Yes they can do that, but it comes with risk which is why I'm not sure if they are actually doing that. It shifts the responsibility of buying shares onto the Market Maker. Thus this type of hedging still results in a net buying of shares. Furthermore there are not enough Call options for shorts to full cover I believe.

**Edit 14 10:20AM:**

**The dome is my own version of the ""Rounding Top"".** The rounding top is a sign of reversal. My version called the ""Dome"" is different in the sense that it is not used to find reversals, but rather to identify periods of waning momentum. **When volume decreases and the market is bearish, we usually see a dome form** as the price sags downwards. This does not necessarily signal a reversal.

**Edit 13 10:19AM:**

The broader market is down with the S&P down half a percent right now. The tech selloff continues.

With inflation fears and increasing rates, high P/E stocks that are valued mostly based on future expectations of earnings will see selloffs like TSLA and  PLTR. **These high growth tech stocks are mostly valued based on future expectations, so that does not square well with inflation fears.**

**Edit 12 10:16AM:**

GME finishing most of the dome, and now consolidating across VWAP.

https://preview.redd.it/tblyp0eo70o61.png?width=596&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd0ed14d05a7a4a14d8e9e5fdc8f303047dbe03

**Edit 10 9:56AM:**

Speculation: It was the long whales that prevented SSR. What if the longs are shorting this stock so that fewer OTM Calls become ITM? What if shorts are using these Calls to cover?

**Edit 9 9:51AM:**

Seems to be covering of the shorts spent at market open.

https://preview.redd.it/2k2s8jpm70o61.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=7db046b4103296a0f72b4a758f527faeb8bfd1cc

**Edit 5 9:32AM:**

Okay super interesting, **very low volume first minute** at 550k. Seems we'll start quietly in the morning.

**Edit 4 9:30AM:**

**I think it will bounce early around the 183.5 support. Shorts trying to prevent SSR possibly!**

**Edit 3 9:17AM:**

Small edit. **The SSR threshold is 181.58**. Remember though that SSR probably doesn't matter too much. They have other ways to short on a downtick.

**Edit 2 9:11AM:**

I believe today could start quiet, and then go straight up parabolic up or down later in the day. Let's find out at market open and watch the volume.

**Edit 1 9:03AM:**

I just discovered that they may have somehow hacked my main account and deleted my 3/12/21 post about their Conversions and their market manipulation! Fishy...

Goooooooooooooood morning my fellow apes, it's good to be back!

THIS IS A BATTLE. The enemy is strategically sniping DD contributors on this sub. First me. Then Pixel.

**THIS IS HOW YOU KNOW WE ARE WINNING THE GOOD FIGHT. LISTEN TO ME (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE), I LIKE THE STOCK, SO I WILL HOLD. THIS GOES TO $40? I WILL HOLD. THIS GOES TO $5? I WILL HOLD.** Shoutout to u/plumdragon, u/rensole and all the mods for helping me get up and running on my second account!

I believe the shorts have prepared all month for this fight. I believe they have all teams ready, manned up on the ETF desk, the equities desk. They have assembled an entire team of traders to short the shit out of GME **today**.

https://preview.redd.it/px5hpoyk70o61.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb052f5f777e8792654530ed710734649429b5b4

Overall, I remain bullish on this stock. **In fact, my bullishness has only increased after seeing this stock collide head-on into support levels multiple times over the course of this week.** Each time, I almost thought it would smash through the supports and tumble lower, but it didn't. **I was honestly astounded at how strong our support levels held.** I do not make long term predictions lightly, but based on all the evidence before me, I must conclude that our trajectory remains upwards. If the mother of all short attacks happens today, I predict we will respect the strong support levels and bounce sharply.

**Furthermore, there is no evidence of panic selling or dumping by institutions.** As you all have probably seen the Bloomberg terminals, buying and holding has remained strong.

I was one of the people to predict the R\_K\_T pump and dump before it happened. I also called out the S\_L\_V and Tilray pump and dumps a while back.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lw7e1j/why\_tlry\_slv\_and\_rkt\_could\_potentially\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lw7e1j/why_tlry_slv_and_rkt_could_potentially_be/)

**I see absolutely 0 similarities between the recent down trend in GME and the dump in R\_K\_T.** No matter how I look at it, I reach the same conclusion, **GME's recent downtrend was a failed manipulation attempt by short sellers.** We see incredibly low volume, and almost no sellers. Volume was only 11.7 million and there is a clear downtrend in volume and liquidity. We've been gobbling up all the shares at the dips!

**In fact, we outperformed much of the market.** We did better than Palantir, better than Apple, the list goes on. Relax if you see GME in the red. The whole market was down because of bond yields spiking up.

I saw some incredible support at the 200 level. This stock struggled to go lower than 200, reaffirming my belief that the true floor of this stock has risen from 40 to at least 150. Heck I think the 172 diagonal will prove to be an unbreakable shield. I call it the 172 diagonal because that's where we bounced a couple days ago.

https://preview.redd.it/zjkvlyz2dzn61.png?width=2139&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2c09e4c2dc5a4b68cafb73c4058265c9eefdc98

The MACD and RSI look great for the long term. We're about ready for an upwards correction. **It's possible we may bounce on the 172 diagonal today. Keep in mind the SSR threshold for today is  181.58.**

In terms of the long term outlook, I don't view it as a bad thing if we don't squeeze today or next week. **There's nothing bad about a slow and steady climb. It's both sustainable and harder to short attack.** I believe the wild up and downswings of the unsustainable runup during the January runup led to more paper handed and easier short attacks. I see strong evidence in this runup that people have much higher confidence in holding and are most probably buying more and more shares. This is great news for our potential to reach the moon!

If we end in the red again today, no problem. **We're still way ahead of schedule and way above the 172 diagonal.** We're following a clear uptrend and I expect earnings to only help propel us further up.

# Strategy Analysis

I believe today will certainly be unpredictable. There's just so many variables at work on Quadruple Witching Day. I've been through 2 of these days in the past. They were rather uneventful, but who knows, I think GME may be an exception from the norm.

Implied volatility has continued to decrease, allowing for Call contract premiums to be cheaper. **This supports my bull thesis that institutions are gaining increased buying power due to the lower premiums.**

If we take a look in ThinkorSwim at the ImpVolatility (Cyan) and HistoricalVolatility (Purple) indicators, we can get a sense of where we're at in terms of options strategies. Historical Volatility is a measure of a stock's actual volatility based on historical prices, while Implied Volatility is future oriented and calculated with a derivative pricing model.

It seems our fellow wrinkle brain [u/Quiet-Finish7848](https://www.reddit.com/user/Quiet-Finish7848/) has again found some interesting data. It would appear that shorts are increasing on Puts to apply selling pressure on Market Makers who need to delta hedge. **I believe this also means their short attack and Conversions failed miserably yesterday.** They are so desperate, they are now spamming Puts trying to get MMs to drive the price down. HAH!

# Premarket Analysis

I expect a large downswing today to scare retailers. We aren't on SSR yet and they seem to have a lot of shares ready to unload. **If we see the mother of all short attacks happen today, I don't give a damn.** I will hold the stock like I held through the last short attack at $348 because I just really like the stock. **Again, from a purely unbiased technical perspective, I see 0 evidence of retail paper handing. We are holding strong.**

I think today should show significant volume. I will confirm by reading the first minute candlestick volume. Usually anything over 1 million is decent volume. 2 million is fairly strong and anything over that signals a battleground day.

Remember the SSR threshold for today is 181.58. We may see it dip to that level around 9:50AM and bounce on the 172 support.

I promise you, $60, $70 dollars are not the squeeze, not even $200. 

It'll be well above that.

Why?

Because we own the float. There are virtually no shares left out there, it is just us!!!

And if we HOLD this baby, it can reach $1000 or even more. 

And Shitadel needs to buy at any price... at ANY price...

Edit: To those saying this is over.

This is clearly not over. The crooks took the bid out of the market after we started hitting new AH crumbling the share price by manipulating supply/Demand and even letting some of these hedgies escape at artificially low manipulated prices. They parted the sea so these crooks could bail out even though they had plenty of opportunities to cover when the price hit $20, $30, $40. No way around them admitting they can control the price of any security.  They have caused millions in losses through price manipulation and trying to control the narrative. Someone has to be on the hook for this and not the people. We were 100%  right on this play.

Edit: Based on the hearing. Thank you Michael San Nicolas for speaking the truth.

They all benefited from manipulating and driving the price of GME down. Hedge funds, MM's, Clearing Houses and even Robinhood themselves. The lawsuits will be plentiful. Stay strong boys.

Edit: To all the comments belittling folks and calling us bag holders.

You have to be kidding me. Even to you smooth brains out there. I dont understand how this is so hard to understand. They were able to choose who the bag holders would be. Hedge funds were going bankrupt and Brokers, Clearing houses etc refused to carry the bags which is the rule to the current system. The criminals changed the rules so retail would be left with the bags. Let that sink in. Biggest financial heist of our time right in our faces and they think it was neccesary.

And as usual this is not financial advice.

# This is it, by George.. this is literally it

Ok I'm not sure who has seen this and who hasn't but... yeah this changes everything.

We've all had theories of whats going on from naked/sythetic shares being out, how Citadel and the others have been doing what they are doing and it keep going up and down.

I got posted [this](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf) from   u/gafgarian

**Addendum: guys relax thousands of apes want to read so the website may be slow or non responding, relax it didn't get deleted it's just overrun by requests**

[alt link 2 pdf as pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/m6yrgp/gamestop_the_last_great_squeeze_part_1_by_rensole/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/m6z4qq/gamestop_the_last_great_squeeze_part_2_by/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

and everything clicked for me this all suddenly makes sense.

This DD go's into how everything works, from the standard short selling model which we normally see, to the ""bankruptcy jackpot"" method used here.

It's all written in ELIA (Explain it Like I'm an Ape)

it shows that the FTD's are in a cyclical nature, how much float is left in total (about 19.3 Million shares). it go's into the risk model it go's into everything.

&#x200B;

These guys banked on the **bankruptcy jackpot** this means that they bet on the fact that gamestop would go under, destroying the spring and giving them all the tendies, but because Ryan Cohen stepped in this became impossible, also with the digital transition and the positive public sentiment this one is now off the table.

so check the pdf because this stuff is rainman levels of detailed.

to me this shows me that the FTD's are more cyclical in nature, meaning they use Short A to short normally, then they can't find a good share to cover this so what do they do? right they Short again (creating short B), so they use short B to cover the debt of short A, then they short again (creating short C) and they cover short B.... you guys seeing a pattern here?

At this point I no longer care how long this takes, it may take days or weeks or maybe a month, I no longer care, at this point ANYTHING can set this powder keg off, good news, bad news, a Tweet catalyst (I'll be tweeting this document in a sec and tagging everyone I can think about who may be able to do anything I'd say retweet this please the more exposure this gets the better), also buying pressure could kick this off because at this point  the amount they have available is shrinking every single day.

for example:

So people throwing their stimmy's into this, at the end of the month when people get payed you name it. WSB has millions of users and GME has 200k, at this point if everyone in this where to go out today and buy ... I can't imagine what could happen.

Someone also posted this a few days ago: [Citadel has no clothes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/)

This ties back into the fact that they are bleeding money, along with the shit tier bonds.

I'm no longer bullish bearish or whatever, I feel Michael Burry-ish.

Everything I've felt up until reading this pdf was a gut feeling lead by logic, and lead by small parts of the story, some parts which I couldn't tie together, this PDF changed that for me, I've never felt so secure in something, but now... I feel like Michael Burry, we have seen the markers all along the way but now they're tying together nicely.

So forgot the 19th, forget any and all dates, at this point it's just paying attention if a catalyst kicks it off, and remember this can be everything.

This also nicely tied together the DFV tweet of Gargantuan, it's a point of singularity, a black hole, a point of no return.

fun thing is someone else also thought this up

&#x200B;

Also if anyone can pick holes in the PDF please let me know because I've tried to debunk it with no success, as have others I sent this to.

so what else is there today? oh nothing much, only I dunno...

# Something hypothetical and thought not possible happened.

check this [negative Beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6gqt9/this_ape_explains_delta_and_how_a_negative_delta/)

It's been a long ass time since I had some education but as far as I remember a negative beta is not supposed to be able to exist that big, like I remember -1 being very rare, but everything bigger then that shouldn't be possible, yet here we are.

like OP said there:

    To clarify because it is coming up in the comments, a negative beta which 
    is less than -1 is not very unusual and it means that the stock is resistant 
    to a market downturn but doesn't actually go as far as doing the opposite of 
    the market, i.e. -1 or less. But -1 is considered not to exist, 
    although academics never like to say never.

this brilliant ape uses technical calculations on where the price will go, with a  **Ralph Nelson Elliot wave**.

if everyone holds this motherfucker can go into the million a share, I've always tried to reason ""100,000"" a share is enough but with this... I no longer care man, I removed my bottom I'm going to do the same as OP, I'd rather get 80% of the top then selling pennies on the dollar.

This theorem does hinge on a very simple point, we hodl, don't get off the rocket before we are on mars.

# So... Rensole what about the dates?

fuck the dates, people have been hyper focused on the dates for a while now, and if WE know the dates, THEY know the dates, they'll most likely see everyone hyping on the 19th and will try to kick the can to the 25th or longer.

So scrap putting values on dates, stop caring that ""oh we need X date"" no we don't.

We just need to do what we have always done

Eat crayons, get us some awesome dip and hodl.

if we do that there are 2 outcomes,

1. we will be the catalyst and we'll get the entire float (seeing the amount of people we have in this this is actually possible because if half of WSB/GME gets 3 shares or more, this deletes the entire 15 million shares float)
2. we wait for an external catalyst like RC becoming CEO, which can happen next week or within the next 6 months.

&#x200B;

Just be patient, Michael Burry waited 2 YEARS to make one of the best play anyone has ever made.

We can wait a few weeks or months if need be, nothing worth anything ever came easy.

All we need for now is good DD and discussion posts to focus on the pressing issues and uncover HFs fuckeries. As now more than ever, we need to stay focus on validating and vetting each and every DD and theory out there. This will allow us to form an opinion based on logic and evidence. 

Do you think every DD I read I assume it's coming from a good Ape? Of course not. HFs got the money and can hire the best writers in the world to post ""decent"" DD on here and mislead us. HFs can also offer to buy old reddit accounts with crazy Karma to post on here.

My mission as an individual ape is to try to poke a hole in every DD I read and come up with a counter argument. Because smiling, saying yes and agreeing to each DD you read will make us look like a flock of sheep.

Edit 1: I am getting down voted like a mfkr. It's coming from people who need a reality check and shills.

My point is, don't underestimate the people we are fighting. They have everything on their side, MSM, Money, Influencers, Bots, Writers and list goes on. This is not an easy fight and HFs are not going to hand us millions without an ugly fight. 

Stay focused to collect your tendies when time permits. 
Good luck all.

Edit 2: I am not saying we need to stop the positivity and encouragement, we actually need them to stay motivated. 

Edit 3: To those who think I am wolf in sheep's clothing. I am proud to say I have been a GME holder since GME was $10, and I am one of the very first people to create memes to raise awareness about the issue. My memes were trending on Reddit and r/all back in January for weeks, and even went viral worldwide. I did media interviews, and currently on the queue to be part of the Netflix docseries.  

Most importantly,  I lost myself half million in GME and I still believe it's the safest stock in the entire market. if you don't believe it, go check out my profile to see screenshots.

Edit 5: I am not talking about memes. Memes are much needed in this time. They keep the spirit up and bring joy. I am talking about the long a$$ posts that discuss cringy dreams. These are the type of apes will paper hand as soon as we hit $500. Because they are impatient af. I saw $500 and didn't sell. I lost a lot of money but added more and still holding. We will moon eventually but claim down and enjoy the ride while reading good DDs.

This is their play. Don’t fall for it. Hold the line.

Edit to add: there were also 200k shares of XRT borrowed at EOD yesterday (XRT is an ETF containing GME). This could have been the 200k selloff that happened at 12:44pm EST.

Edit to add: This all plays into the $40 price point FUD that was being spread last night and into this morning. They’re trying to make you think it’s hopeless.

Edit to add: Add to that the fact that GME is on the short sale restriction list, so people think attacks like this shouldn’t be happening today. it’s a perfect recipe to get people to panic sell.

I am gonna be honest with you, I am really starting to get pissed about people spreading lies about what I said. I am getting tagged in about 150 - 200 posts a day and about the same amount of comments. Half of which is people trying to slander my name and telling other people lies about what I said is going to happen this week and how I supposedly said, this is ""the last chance"" (quote by one of the dumbf\*\*\* that slandered me over the last few weeks) for a Gamma Squeeze or Short Squeeze to happen.

&#x200B;

I am calling out this post specifically, because it gained the most traction and called out u/rensole and me:

[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/GME\/comments\/m5spf5\/reminder\_that\_the\_19th\_is\_not\_the\_last\_possible\/](https://preview.redd.it/qa1ogy259cn61.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=b479bb5b30085e2cf5c2ee345105dbb3ccdb9d18)

(Longer TL;DR at point III)

TL;DR: And I just want to clarify, because it actually seems to be a new FUD campaign (what isn't at this point lol), that theyTM want to do, is split people as hard as they can. (nothing new, but it's just really obvious this week) Every few minutes there is a new post about the importance of this week and then there is the same amount of people saying fuck this week. My thoughts? **I stand by my Endgame DD BUT(!!!!!) I really don't care what happens this week**. Of course I want my prediction to become true, but if it doesn't? I'll keep on living and hodl urge you to do the same. There are so many catalysts this week, next week (even more for next week as of now to be honest, but they weren't there when I created the Endgame DD) and the weeks after. I will just wait and see and can only urge people to do the same.

Quoting my own comment:

[https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/wallstreetbets\/comments\/m5jn1y\/gme\_megathread\_for\_march\_15\_2021\/gr1xnl9?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://preview.redd.it/09o7j3xp3cn61.png?width=683&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ca1d4d157fe84af469c3cc5088bb6a3ec3880d9)

So please. Don't follow every bullshit post calling me out and be critical, here is why.

&#x200B;

I. I created my Endgame DD 16 days ago. I stated that this is **MY** predicted date for the **START** of a squeeze. The bullshit post I quoted above stated the following:

https://preview.redd.it/zyy0xkq25cn61.png?width=699&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd38003151a250c6cd0aa530ec842b8318dff030

So far so legitimate, of course that can be his opinion. But who are persons behind such posts? Now it's just getting stupid and that's the thing that drives me mad the most.

https://preview.redd.it/svn06nhr5cn61.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=b59cfb2f343656167312d141eaeb3f576a779a7a

&#x200B;

II. **Persons behind posts like that**: They are almost always (85 - 90 %) either new accounts, revived accounts (dead for years/months and suddenly start posting on GME, etc.) or they are just inexperienced people that have no clue what they are talking about.

&#x200B;

In this case we are looking at point 3 ""inexperienced people that have no clue what they are talking about"". The guy that called me out jumped on the GME bandwagon just 3 weeks ago. Before that, he didn't have a single post about trading on his whole profile. Doesn't mean anything, could just be a closet trader, right? Look at his comments over the past 1 - 3 weeks.

I am gonna spare you with more, just look at his profile. It literally only consits of such comments.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion:** Someone who has no experience in trading, being an asshole to the community for weeks, asking for selling points, spreading FUD over a month, saying the squeeze is over and he is going to sell is suddenly an expert on all this and wants people to stop putting dates on things, because it's spreading FUD? BRUUUUH. Don't get me wrong, you don't have to be an expert to give your opinion on stuff, but calling me out like that without any substance and telling people lies about what I said is going to happen this week? That's just bullshit. The person that posted this is a paperhanded pussy, dividing the community with FUD and lies and wants people to agree with him, because he doesn't has the nerve to hold through these dips himself. Especially the OP of the post stated above, wants to make himself look like he holds the community together now, telling people to hold, etc.. He literally spread FUD over one whole month and now this? Give me a break you hypocrite. u/qwerksd

&#x200B;

III. **Clarification about my Endgame DD, Dates, this week, what the guy above stated I apparently said, etc.:** I NEVER EVER(!) said this week is going to be the last chance for a squeeze (Gamma/Short). I said, data supports, that it's going to start at AROUND march 19th. Maybe this week, maybe next week, who the fuck knows? People really just need to hold and stop it with the bullshit posts trying to divide people. That's why I stepped down from posting at the moment. I don't want to add fuel to the fire, by giving such people more opportunities to badmouth and lie about what I said. They damn well know, that I can't respond to every comment because of the ammount of comments, messages, tags etc. I receive everyday. So of course it looks like I don't reply to critique. People that know me a bit better by now know, I love doing that.

&#x200B;

Just wanted to clarify all this. Maybe it makes up peoples mind a bit that this is not a ""do or die moment"" for GME. **This is a ""would be nice if this happens"" moment.** The amount of catalysts and data just supports, that things COULD happen in the near near future. But as I just said 20 times, be patient and hodl.

**My opinion on all this:** People saying we should stop to put date on things, are just paper handed pussies and want people to agree, so they won't get dissapointed and paperhand out, when nothing happens on dates being talked about. If there are legitimate reasons to talk about dates and there are dates, on which big things could happen? TALK ABOUT THEM. You don't have to say things will become true, you don't even have to put your opinion out there, but no one should ban you from talking about dates, just because they have nerves made out of used toilet paper. If people hate it, they downvote it. If people like it, they upvote it and spread the word, because there really seems to be good reasoning and reasearch behind such a post. Stop telling people what to do and what not to do, there are functions in reddit for that.

&#x200B;

**IN SHORT: I LIKE THE STOCK 💎🙌 And no matter what happens this week, next week, next months, this year, I don't give a fuck. I am going to hold and be patient. This is not a do or die moment. This is a ""would be nice if this happens"" moment.**

Yes NINE HUNDRED %,1615334964.0,"*Edit: have passed on various comments to him so will reply once he gets back to me*


So my colleague, who has no reddit account and wishes to be anonymous has been doing some maths (or math for you americans) in an attempt to back solve Short interest, using short volume & trading volume. The base behind his findings was that any short volume over 50% cannot be 100% covered that day... he just thought - how much can these short boys actually cover, if all shorts opened were intended to be covered...

Here's what he's worked out spoiler alert:>!shorts r fuk!<

So, I have been freaking the fuck out about this.  I am of the belief that at one point, FINRA said the truth about SI%... Being 226% on the 15th of january.  I had thought it was impossible to figure out what it was now, but then I started digging into the Short Volume.

At first, I had thought that it would be interesting if we could see how much they could have covered if 100% of long volume transfers went to covering shorts (Short Overflow)...

So then, I got a thought... let me manually import the short volume data since the 15th and see where this could go.

So from the FINRA report I got:

* Short Volume
* Short Exempt Volume
* Exchanged Volume (Long Volume + Short Volume)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ufx7eqrg01m61.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=82b07618b9136b4fce477e9d99a0f364d34664ce

From Yahoo Historical Data I got:

* Total Trade Volume
* Day's Closing
* Day's low

Then I calculated this: Total Short Volume (SV + SEV)

* Long Volume (ExV - SV)
* SV% (TSV / EV)
* Off Exchange Volume (TV - EV)
* Short Overflow (TSV - LV)

&#x200B;

I realized that this all cost them a fuck ton.

So I said:  If they covered through calls, then they as an extreme minimum paid 40$/share for them AND only would do so when GME was on the way up as it would be a waste of money otherwise. Thus I made MinimalCost of OFF-Exchange as (OEV \* $40).

If they covered through Long Volume on market, then we'd be able to estimate that CONSERVATIVELY by comparing the days low to the Daily long volume (Day's Low \* LV).

Then came to the conclusion of the data:

I wrote down the FINVIZ float, the SI% from FINRA, and derived the Short Volume at the time. THEN, I made 3 tables:

* Table 1: Shows how many Shorts are there at different intervals of covering on Off-market and On-market.
* Table 2: Shows the cost of doing those coverings.
* Table 3: Shows the new SI%.

https://preview.redd.it/8nex25fh01m61.png?width=1806&format=png&auto=webp&s=609c43567a68e7b50b5a588d4dd58ee9116e8c8a

IN CONCLUSION:   Using My data, I was able to derive that the **535.9% SI%** being passed around would cost Short Sellers 25 BILLION DOLLARS theoretically.

The **Maximum SI% can be rn is 942.06%.**

It is **litterally impossible for it to be under 200% rn** as it would be too costly.

I believe that SI% is over 600%, as I believe that certain companies ran while they could, spending 10 billion dollars AT MOST between them all for covering.

Because you cannot justify over 20% of long volume transfers being covering, its mostly algos and day traders as for calls, I just dont see that going over 30% as its abundantly clear calls are being used against them, not for them. and even that is pushing it.

My point for my want is this: **It is impossible that SI% is not more than 226%** as was said on the 15th as the costs would be to great and the data is just not there to support it but instead I came to the conclusion that we are way fucking past that for simmilar reasons

NOTE: NONE OF THIS EVEN TAKES INTEREST INTO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR COSTS, IT IS ALL JUST THEORETICAL COVERING COSTS ALONE. THE DATA DOES NOT SUPPORT THEM HAVING COVERED MUCH AT ALL, YOU TAKE FROM THIS WHAT YOU WILL. I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR DONT COME BITCHING.

I want all apes to know that regardless how retarded, smooth brain apes you are, trust in basic math and common sense. I can't stress the importance of this and will continue to post this until every retarded person understand the concept.

Just know that TSLA had a short of 20%, a larger float than GME, a bunch of paper hand folks who didn't even know about the SI or believe in the damn stock, and it went to 4.5k (Combine 5:1 split) a share.

GME has a short of 120% (Probably 600%+), a smaller float, and diamond apes. So even if you're a paper hand f\*\*k, common sense dictate that you hold to at least 25k. That's just common sense. I keep seeing new apes, not shills, thinking that they should sell at 1k, 2k, 5k, or to sell upwards when it mathematically makes no sense. I don't know how I can make this more clear for you retards to understand.

**If you can do that, then by the time it gets to 25k, stays at that price, and 5 days have passed, even the largest liquidity short hedge funds would get margin called, and that's when the price actually rockets since at that point, the short hedge funds no longer determine when they buy and the clearing house takes over and buys at market price. That's why the floor is 15 million.**

[Never forget when they turned off the buy in January, the SEC went after WSB redditors and not the one who shorted with synthetic shares.](https://i.redd.it/5wll9txcutw61.gif)

None of this is financial advice

# 801

Ok so yesterday there was some confusion on what rule came into play so let's do a quick rundown.

The OCC-801 changes how much they can pass on and how they do it, Basically the OCC can pass on costs of a member default to the other members. like ""spreading the load""

The NSCC-801 Notice of Filing of Advance Notice to Amend the Supplemental Liquidity Deposit Requirements.

This one allows for daily and intra day risk assessments, collection of Secondary Liquidity Deposits (SLD), and forced closing of positions of the member can’t pay the SLD. see this as for example what happened to RH at the end of January, you need X amount to keep playing pay up or you're out, but instead of just being out it's a margin call.

As far as I can tell the NSCC-801 is getting a chance to get filed on the 9th, and then take 10 business days to pass.

Also some good reading that goes along with this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mlv6io/dtc_letter_of_securities_possession_not_what_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), <this reads like a ""proof or ban"" SEC edition to me.

So another closed door meeting, but the minutes should be available shortly after, at least that was the case last time, I believe we got it the day after.

the bulletin points raised:

* Institution and settlement of injuctive actions;
* Institution and settlement of administrative proceedings;
* Resolution of litigation claims; and
* Other matter relating to examinations and enforcement proceedings

So is this good or bad ? I personally believe good because it looks like the SEC has been quiet so long in order to prepare for 1 hit TKO. it's not unlikely that these are all normal meetings by frequency but if we look at what they are going over... yeah I think it may be related to the current situation of gme.

No drama!

We are one big family of apes, and we are focused on one thing, the Stonk. we don't do drama, politics or ideology for a very simple reason, we can find thousands of minute things to divide us but we all have one thing in common, the stonks.

So lets focus on the good things, and lets forget about the things that don't matter right now, and if you disagree with someone, don't call them names, ask questions.Why do you think X, or how did you come to your conclusion because I believe Y.

The more civil we can keep it the better primed we are to help each other, and the more helpful opposing viewpoints become, because disagreeing with someone can be a very good thing, if done right both parties learn and grow.

So please be kind to one and other, this is how we where able to create a great community in these past months and flourish.

Be friendly, help others!

as always we are here from all different walks of life and all different countries.

This doesn't matter as we are all apes in here, and apes are friends.

Doesn't matter if you're a silverback a chimp or a bonobo.

We help each other, we care for each other.

**Ape don't fight ape, apes help other apes**

this helps us weed out the shills really fast, as if everyone is helpful, the ones who aren't stand out.

remember the fundamentals of this company are great, they should be above the current price point, so for the love of god if someone starts with trying to spread FUD, remind yourself of the fundamentals.

There is no sense of urgency, this will come when it comes, be a week, be it a month be it six.

I think this needs to be said.  We should be supporting each other.  These guys aren't shills and just because Wall Street Bets sold out, doesn't mean the mods and important people in GME have also done the same.

So let's knock off the Ape on Ape shit and get back to doing what we do best.  Buying and hodling.  Dreaming on what we good things we can do for the world with our tendies.

I want to pay off my mom's house and repay all my relatives who spent time investing in me.  From all the 25 buck birthday cards even though I never see them.  To the kind wedding gifts to get my family on it's feet when we were just starting out.   Pay off all my debt.  Buy out an entire GameStop and donate it's contents to John Hopkins Children's Hospital where my daughter had surgery and I stayed for over a week.

Find worth while charities for people and my fellow Veterans who are struggling.

I just wanted to say this because it actually struck some fear into my head to think about it. A lot of us here come from meager backgrounds. We are not professional stock brokers, we are not media moguls, and most of us are not financial experts. We are a bunch of dirty, stinkin' apes that just want some bananas.

When we land on the moon, some of us may get adventurous. We may want to celebrate. Morals can get twisted. Debauchery can ensue. And usually with debauchery comes... *drugs*.

While I am no saint, and cannot dictate what other people do, I implore all of you beautiful apes to please be careful when celebrating. You may end up partying one night and trying something you maybe shouldn't... but the difference would be that you have a *lot* of finances to keep going. 

Pills and powders and such are extremely addictive. They are costly as well, but what is cost to a space monkey? You could end up saying ""maybe one more couldn't hurt""... until it becomes a broken record. As much as you may trust your own willpower, they can completely take over your mental if you are not *very* careful. They can very easily destroy your life. Don't fall into the trap. Celebrate responsibly.

Remember. Apes are some of the strongest creatures on earth. Ape likes greens. Not pills and powders. Greens make ape **stronk**. Stick to greens.  💪🏼🦍

Edit: I don't think I made it entirely clear. Greens are vegetables weed and money. I was smoking a blunt when I wrote this lol. Smoke your heart out just don't forget to go easy on your lungs. I haven't done any, but mushrooms and other natural drugs have some research suggesting health benefits if used properly and sparingly. Moderation is key. I said stay away from
drugs because some apes hear ""Moderation"" and all they see is a green light. Don't be that ape. It's a dangerous trap. 

Above all just make sure to take care of your health when your sitting on the moon with your mountain of tendies. It would suck to get there just to fall as hard as you rose.

For anyone with any lingering doubts about GME price being getting manipulated prepare to have your 🦍🧠🤯.

I am going to show some fairly definitive proof, using a measure called **'On-Balance Volume'** which will show that all the downward price pressure has been with EXTREMELY minimal volumes.

You apes don't only have 💎✋ BUT ARE ALSO BUYING THE DIPS because total net buying volume has net INCRASED since January!

For me personally, this was the final piece of evidence I needed to feel certain about where this stock is going. 🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

\---------- **BOILERPLATE:**

I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀

**TLDR: Price drop from Jan 29 to Feb 4 was done with almost no net negative buying pressure (very low share volumes). Proof that 🦍 are💎✋ AND are buying the dips! Overall positive buying pressure has only increased since January. 💎✋🚀🚀🚀**

&#x200B;

**---------- On Balance Volume (OBV)**

Before I 🤯 your mind, here is what **OBV (On-Balance Volume)** is all about:

&#x200B;

>On Balance Volume (OBV) measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator, adding volume on up days and subtracting it on down days.

On Balance Volume (OBV) line is simply a running total of positive and negative volume. A period's volume is positive when the close is above the prior close and is negative when the close is below the prior close.

>The absolute number of the OBV does not matter, what does is the relative height of the line over time.

**Rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices.** **Conversely, falling OBV reflects negative volume pressure that can foreshadow lower prices.**

This means, that if we see a significant decline in share price, we should also see a decrease in OBV line at a similar magnitude.

For my fellow 🤓, here is the equation:

**---------- Examples of share price following OBV**

Below I have 5 examples from other companies (AMD, Tesla, Cineplex, Royal Caribbean, Canopy) and all of them have OBV lines that very nicely go along with the share price.

Note: All data from TradingView (awesome app btw) and Period set to 1 day.

**This is what the relationship between OBV and price should look like.** In fact, the whole purpose of the OBV is that it actually can show when a price is about to move in a certain direction as you can see the spikes in OBV are all 1 to 2 periods before the share spikes.

* Here you can see huge positive buy pressure from Jan 12 to 27, increasing by 462% with a share price increase of $305 ([VWAP - volume weighted average price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp#:~:text=The%20volume%20weighted%20average%20price%20(VWAP)%20is%20a%20trading%20benchmark,and%20value%20of%20a%20security)).
* Then the share price dropped by $264 (80%) from January 29 to Feb 4. If this was a real drop (i.e. people were actually selling their shares), we would expect a relative decrease in the buying pressure, however we only see it go down by 9%! 🤣🤣
* When GME spiked in February, it actually gained more total positive buying pressure and surpassed the previous high point set on January 27!
* It has only gone higher since. **On March 10 & 12, we were at the highest level, 25% higher than January** and even today, we are still 17% higher. This is also important because it showed that not much extra buy pressure was required to bring the price up from $40 to $300

**THIS AS CLOSE AS YOU WILL GET TO PROOF OF 💎✋! Almost no one actually sold during this period, or we would have seen a huge increase in negative buy pressure.** If you just looked at the OBV, you would think that the stock price should be around $450-500

The **red line is what I think the OBV SHOULD look like for the current stock price.**

**Note: This observations is true if you set the period to 1 week, 1 day,  4 hours, 3 hours, 2 hours and 1 hour**

Why we are actually better positioned for a short squeeze now than January.,1617422517.0,"**This is not financial advice. These are opinions. Seek an financial professional for investment advice.**

Hi everyone. It's me, Warden, and I don't usually post on  weekends (I have break today so Friday is part of my 3 day weekend). But anyways, I thought I would share my thoughts on Goldstein's responses in the AMA. I think she's doing the community a great service. I'd like to share some of my thoughts on her responses.

Edit: Sorry if my title is a bit misleading. I was referencing her comments on the *gamma squeeze* as well as her uncertainty on if the MOASS will happen or not.

# Let's talk about the Gamma Squeeze possibility

First off, she seemed to reference the same thing I referenced in the past.

>Option premiums on GameStop/GME implied volatility are still through the roof, too, and I presume will be for some time -- option sellers are going to demand a major premium for taking on risk of it going haywire again.

This is the main rhetoric for why a gamma squeeze cannot happen. For the smooth brains: Call options are extremely expensive because of the high Implied Volatility. High IV leads to higher premiums. **For a gamma squeeze to happen, you need to be able to buy lots of Call options quickly and cheaply.**

I mentioned we would squeeze the old fashioned way: through the raw purchasing of shares and through the power of catalysts perhaps in early April. I'd like to provide an update on that thesis.

**We've actually seen significant IV crush this last week.** IV crush is basically IV getting crushed. Week after week, the IV has settled down and the prices for Calls has become cheaper.

https://preview.redd.it/091mmyb6gtq61.png?width=2133&format=png&auto=webp&s=d69b9958517c8e64a30681c903aca62b32e6e72b

The cyan line at the bottom is the Implied Volatility. Notice how it is going down over time.

As you can see, we have settled down back to the IV from before the 2/24 climb. In fact, we've increased the price four fold while decreasing IV. **That is extremely impressive and evidence that bulls have very good control over the recent runup.**

I believe they are setting the stage, and may keep the IV crush going for a couple more trading days before they launch their next long attack.

Imagine launching a rocket into space. If you could hypothetically build a launch pad hundreds of miles above the ground, it would be easier to launch your rocket. There's less gravity and less distance, so your rocket can fly further with the same amount of fuel. **I believe bulls are building that launch pad and it is near completion. I believe a gamma squeeze is once again possible for the near future.**

Furthermore, if you zoom in to a smaller timescale, the Implied Volatility is lower than the Historical Volatility. This means the options are priced relatively cheap.

https://preview.redd.it/hpseyw57gtq61.png?width=2171&format=png&auto=webp&s=774c06ee7056ab07d347d39632df2e9156121095

The cyan line, the IV, is lower than the purple line, the HV.

So great, we have a launchpad built that's 4 times higher than January's launch pad. Now what about short interest?

# Is short interest still high?

Alexis Goldstein also talked about the shorts' positions.

>I want to stress that I don't have a crystal ball. I just think enough shorts got burned that people are probably more cautious now than they were before. And anyone selling options on GME are demanding very high premiums for taking the risk.

My thoughts were, how can you get burned if you haven't covered? In my best judgement, the shorts are still sitting with high unrealized losses and refuse to cover. They certainly are cautious compared to before, but they are still trapped in their losing position. **Retailers have an asymmetric opportunity. They lose nothing by holding, while the shorts lose from interest and option premiums.**

I'd like to clarify that in my stream, some people thought I said the SI could be lower than what Fintel reports. I'd like to clarify that misunderstanding. I believe SI could be lower than the theoretical minimum of 130% which is calculated off the Short Volume data. Fintel could over report short volume. However this doesn't mean SI is low. **In fact I believe it is still extremely high over 100%.**

What evidence do we have? Well on Wednesday, 3/31, we saw an anomaly appear that hadn't shown up for 2 weeks: the Deep ITM Calls. I believe the last time we spotted these was on 3/17. They've been speculated to use these to reset FTDs.

So ask yourself, why would they need to reset FTDs, if SI is low? That wouldn't make sense, because that would result in fewer synthetic/counterfeit shares. Therefore, I can assume they still have a massive problem with their short position and conclude that SI is still extremely high. Lastly, I believe they have concealed their short interest via options. There are many ways to do this, and this would explain the low short interest Fintel is reporting.

What about institutional ownership? In the Bloomberg terminal, it shows that before January, the institutional ownership was 194%. Now it's 130%. It's probably a bit higher because of how Fidelity filed their position change. I think they moved their 9 million shares to a different alias. So it could be around 140-150%.

# Are long institutions still in it? Is retail holding?

Now back to Alexis Goldstein.

>I think GameStop volatility will continue because there are now just too many eyes on it, and too many people with FOMO.

**That's exactly right, retail has been FOMOing in but with diamond hands. People aren't selling.**

The decrease in institutional ownership doesn't concern me, because I believe that 64% gap was filled by retail in the recent runup. This is why you don't see huge swings downwards recently. The floor has been lifted slowly by retail and now it's harder than ever to short attack.

The gap between these two dotted red lines are filled by retail buying. We really are squeezing them the old fashioned way, via raw buying power.

There's really nothing more dangerous, than a million apes buying shares and holding them. Not even a professional trader in Wall Street can fight that kind of buying power.

Furthermore, as Goldestein speculates, I too believe big institutions that longed GameStop are still in it.

>I mean hedge funds have a lot of different strategies, and many of them may be long GME at this point -- at least in the short term. This has always been my general thesis: that GME may have been ignited by retail, but there are likely big institutional players involved as well. I spoke about this [a bit on the BBC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa7_KVfMuKo): and at my newsletter: [https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/what-happened-with-gamestop/](https://marketsweekly.ghost.io/what-happened-with-gamestop/)

**Edit 1:** Edited out the part about Senvest and Maverick. **For the full 13G details on when institutions file:**

>Any changes to the information contained in a Schedule 13G form must be amended through additional reporting. Institutional investors are required to file an amendment to report any changes within 45 days of the end of the year or within 10 days of first finishing a month above 10% and then within 10 days of any month-end where the holder's ownership increases or decreases by 5% or more. Passive investors have similar requirements for reporting amendments.6

**Edit 2:** Without 13Gs, judging by the chart, the price has never dropped significantly for a long period of time. Seems the floor has consistently increased as I have speculated in my first stream. We will continue to climb at a steady rate, while occasionally seeing a short attack or two that temporarily disrupts the floor. I see the steady climb as evidence for Long institutions holding.

# Possible catalysts in April.

As I have mentioned in my second Monday stream, I believe there are plenty of catalysts coming in April. First you have the share recall. If the same shares that are recalled also happened to be shorted, those shares must be covered and there will be a short squeeze. Will we see a short squeeze in April or whenever those shares are recalled for the June shareholder vote? Maybe. It depends, again, on which shares are recalled, and how many shares are recalled. The more shorted shares that get recalled, the better.

Let's not forget about April 4/4, 2020 during the last share recall. SI was high, and the stock skyrocketed to 6.460 from the dip of 2.574. I believe this is proof of the plausibility of my share recall theory.

https://preview.redd.it/xb7kad89gtq61.png?width=2139&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaf9c40d490cfc0fcbf47930b1f3dd17b7bd9d66

There was even an article on it.

[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4336290-gamestop-shareholders-must-call-in-shares-april-20th-to-vote](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4336290-gamestop-shareholders-must-call-in-shares-april-20th-to-vote)

In the article, Justin Dopierala, the President and Founder of DOMO Capital states:

>Therefore, out of the public float of 56.69 million shares, only 24.69 million non-institutional shares are available to trade on a daily basis. Out of these, 14 million shares are held by shareholders that are likely to vote, as previously noted. This leaves only about 10.7 million shares available for shorts to purchase as they are forced to exit their positions (assuming you and I and every other shareholder is willing to sell to them at all). An interesting note here... if these shareholders representing 14 million shares have not yet called in their shares, that by itself creates over a 3 million share deficit.

He makes a point that there is a possibility of share deficit. With the recent high short interest as well as the ever shrinking float of freely trading shares (honestly are there even any real shares left?), an infinity squeeze is even more likely.

I'd like to mention that one of my friends who I consider to be my mentor, and who taught me a lot of what I know, mentioned this to me:

https://preview.redd.it/mbsikdr9gtq61.png?width=351&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f01eec62ddf78b34061142267ab5c12999a3aba

I believe that if it is not the share recall that triggers the MOASS, the next most likely thing is the SEC investigations. The recent DD on Collateral re-use is brilliant. I believe it ties into Citadel, Archegos and the SEC investigations. I am doing research over the weekend on this complicated topic, but I have a feeling that things are a lot more interconnected than we realize.

I plan to talk about Statistics, variance and comparing VWAP across exchanges on my Monday stream. I have begun reading more into detecting short squeezes and have started reading an old whitepaper that caught my attention back in February.

**Edit:** Regarding what I said about OBV showing people sold. Yes it shows people sold in January, but right now, OBV shows are are diamond handing like chads. Just want to make that clear.

Ain't nobody selling in Feb or March.

&#x200B;

**Another Edit:** Let's not forget about the activist takeover. Sherman's contract is possible ending without a renewal in mid April. If Ryan Cohen becomes CEO, that would be huge.

# Addressing some of the drama lately

So there's been some comments made about me recently on the sub. I'll briefly cover it on my Monday daily post. I have a gallery of threads put together and I'll put it on my post. I believe it should address all the concerns people are having lately. For folks who don't know who I am and haven't read my old posts since the beginning of when I started posting, my gallery and post on Monday should catch you up.

Have a great weekend everyone!

This lets us estimate the price per share as people jump off at different points on the way up, which is expected, everyone has a different price point, just as different sell points are expressed.


Geometric mean is basically an average of numbers that have exponential growth. For Apespeak, Bananas that grows more bananas as you eat them. You take the Max share price you expect, and then the current shareprice, and you calculate the Geometric Mean. This article explains it better than I can, I just am a retarded ape that loves crayons with colors out of space.


https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/what-is-geometric-mean/#:~:text=What%20is%20Geometric%20Mean%3F,investment%20or%20an%20investment%20portfolio



For argument's sake, we are going to use 150% short, so 75 million shares that need to be covered. The numbers below are the peak Price per Share, Total Payout of GME, and overall price per share for the payout.
So without Further ado


1k per share price total payout would be $33,525,000,000 @ 447 per share (Geometric Mean)


5k per share price total payout would be $75,000,000,000 @ 1000 per share (Geometric Mean)


10k per share price total payout would be $106,050,000,000 @ 1414 per share (Geometric Mean)


42k per share price total payout would be $217,350,000,000 @ 2898 per share (Geometric Mean)


69k per share price total payout would be $278,550,000,000 @ 3714 per share (Geometric Mean)


100k per share price total payout would be $335,400,000,000 @ 4472 per share (Geometric Mean)


500k per share price total payout would be $750,000,000,000 @ 10000 per share (Geometric Mean)


1m per share price total payout would be $1,060,650,000,000 @ 14142 per share (Geometric Mean)


2m per share price total payout would be $1,500,000,000,000 @ 20000 per share (Geometric Mean)


20m per share price total payout would be $4,743,375,000,000 @ 63245 per share (Geometric Mean)



TLDR: In summation, its really not as much as a payout as you think, regardless of its Peak.  So you might say ""Hey wait! X price is too damn much! We'd bleed the world dry and awaken Elder gods!"" And I say, ""Nay fair Ape, you'd only cause Azathoth to roll over. There will still be a world left to enjoy your tendies. Even at 20 mill per share.""

It verifies:

1. Shares are recalled for verification before the meeting.
2. Recall Notice goes out 60 days prior to meeting; that's April 12 for us.
3. Shorted Shares can't vote.

It says that even though Institutional represented 40% of the shares, they only carried 5% of the vote.  That's because the fund manager's had lent out the shares for shorting.  The top three funds were:

1. Blackrock
2. Vanguard
3. Fidelity

Everyone NEEDS to read this article to understand what's coming.  You have to be sure you've turned off margin on your $GME shares otherwise, the fund managers will find a way to loan them out.

This is important because it's our only shot at proving all the naked shorting that's been going on.  When they go out to verify shares, and it comes back as over 100% outstanding, that may be our only proof to kick off an audit of shares.

If the fund managers loan out YOUR SHARES for shorting, your votes won't count.  If the total comes in under 100%, nothing will happen.  NO LAUNCH!!!

Also as I didn't expect this to blow up I was just kinda rough with my working out as I typed this up on my phone before going to bed so I will now add more detail to avoid the same questions being asked.

This is not financial advice I'm an ape who puts numbers into robot and it go beep boop bbrrrr. 

Ok so I'm assuming we have now all seen the ""glitch"" orders. I don't believe they are glitches. Once you can say ok it happened but we have seen it happen 5 times and the first time it happened, 94m on $46.12 the price was then at $184.68 less than 24 hours later.

Using the share orders that have appeared over the last four days. (630m, 113m, 290m, 167m) that totals 1.2B - The reason why I have added them all together rather than using them individually is that 630m was the first order that appeared. I know these hedgefunds aren't covering so the next day when 113m appeared there is no way they covered 517m shares. I think the 1.2B (and counting) are linked to the darkpool and the shit show that is the ETF packages. 

If you need a video break this is along the lines of what I'm thinking. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25EUhZGBws

Using the last buy order that appeared in February of 94m that jumped the price from $46.12 to $184.68 an increase of 300.434% 

To work out what the true value of a GME share price is right now we take the 1,201,846,831 share order and divide it by 94,189,110 the first order back in Feb. 

1,201,846,831 / 94,189,110  = 12.75993404 

Knowing that a 94m order increased the price by just over 300% we can now hypothetically see what a 1.2B share order will do to the price. 

300.434 x 12.75993404 = 3833.518

A 3833.518% increase on $183.75 

$7,227.83

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

But wait... I thought $10m was the floor? 

Oh Apes... beautiful beautiful apes. I said the true value of a GME share right now is $7,227.83 based on very simple maths and everything being linear from the last crazy buy order. 

The GME float is 42.28m. Yahoo reports that institutions hold 167.96% of the float its likely much higher. Retail is also likely much higher. 

If we put this in terms of SI% a buy order for 1.2B shares is 2654% of the float. YES. 2654!!!!!

42.28m x 26.54255369 = 1,201,846,831 

They have to buy the float 26.54 times before they can close their position and say all those shares were sold and available immediately and at the same time then the price right now would be $7,227.83. I believe that these numbers will only increase as time goes on. The longer this drags out the more shares they will print and the more they will have to pay diamond handed apes. Don't be frustrated by waiting if these Hedgies want to pay for a round trip to a galaxy far far away let them. I only wanted to go to the moon but they insist apes take out the death star. 

So guess what happens when apes diamond hand?

🦍 + 💎🙌 = 🚀🌚💰🍌


If there is no supply and there is demand of 1.2B and counting as these hedgefunds are still carrying on with this illegal shit the squeeze will last weeks the price will get higher and higher. I'm not putting a exact price or date on anything but $10m is not a meme and hedgefunds will eventually be liquidated. They have insurance policies, a ton of assets, the DTCC and the goverment will all make sure apes get paid. 

Don't fuck with apes. Apes set high scores.

See those gaming chairs? great for E-sports or lan parties like the old days, place to chill and card games? man count me in!

&#x200B;

So GameStop is moving into a new type of business, this is evident in the way that their business is changing from brick and mortar ""buy my games and gtfo"" to ""buy the game or just chill"" this in itself will lead to bigger streams of revenue, if you for example look at ""Friday night magic"" (magic the gathering get togethers) they could sell more drinks and small things to ""oh i'm here anyway might as well pick up X videogame/collectable/cards/anything they offer""

this with the new push to digital means that it's no longer speculation that the old GameStop is dead, it's becoming fact that a new type of business, a customer centric business has risen from it's ashes.

# The hearing

Ok can someone go check on Robinhood and Citadel, because they'll need some help getting out from under that bus.

&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/m7o6d3/video/23eegby3ern61/player

First of all mr Dennis Kelleher is spitting some hard facts.

Remember in the god tier DD, it shows that the FTD's are in a cyclical nature.

With the statements made yesterday we now know that we have this exact thing happen, because all they need is a ""reasonable belief"" to think they can deliver that stock, I really hope the SEC and the Government in general focusses more on this and adopts a European like law saying ""if you don't have it you can't do it"" because with ""reasonable belief""... man just imagine if we had this rule with taxes or anything for that matter.

&#x200B;

""sir why did you steal that car?'""oh no because I believed it was mine, I have a reasonable belief I can return this in time""""...very well sir please be careful""

Also some other important things that came to light in the senate hearing;

**""Citadel securities is not a systemically significant firm, and FSOC should investigate it...."" MR. DENNIS KELLEHER**

They said flat out, if Citadel stopped to exist RIGHT NOW it would stop about 26% of us equities, which sounds a lot but look at GME how many times have they ""bought and sold"" the same shares over and over again, Volume does not equate to business nor profit nor importance.

https://reddit.com/link/m7o6d3/video/heodqguzfrn61/player

Now this lady, Ms. Alexis Goldstein she has a god damn wrinkly brain.

she has made some very good facts on how there may be some loopholes in the system that people like citadel could be using to their advantage. we have seen the same happen with the rule of daily to monthly reports of the SEC.

it's something they could say ""oh you say monthly? but this one says daily so these are contradicting so I don't have to comply"" Remember folks no one stays on top with huge businesses and lots of capital by playing nice.

The only thing I didn't like about the hearing is the fact that they focused on the wrong thing, we don't have a payment-for-order problem, we have a naked/synthetic/shorting-problem.

Seriously if they can't see that GameStop's entire thing is a literal showcase on why short selling is a problem if left unregulated then I don't think anyone in that senate should be there.

&#x200B;

https://reddit.com/link/m7o6d3/video/t4moaqyfjrn61/player

hmmm that makes my noggin think....

SEC is looking close in to Citatadel short selling. Big indication of abusive short selling 🤔

&#x200B;

I'm sure I'm missing some other facts here and I'll add them here over time (i'm sure my fellow apes don't mind raising some good points as always 😉)

# Robinhood never had your shares

yup this may as well be as Fud as it gets, just set your account to cash as stated here:[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7jhp4/time\_to\_launch\_the\_rocket\_this\_is\_the\_catalyst/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7jhp4/time_to_launch_the_rocket_this_is_the_catalyst/)

This forces them to buy the buy the stocks as far as I know

posted in comments by u/AdInternational975

    Remember when you convert to a RH cash account, once you sell, the funds have to settle for 3 days before you can reinvest them again. It’s different than RH Instant. So be sure you want to sell when you hit that button because you won’t be able to buy back in immediately if needed. You can invest any other settled funds just not the ones that have to clear. I’ve been a cash account since this all started. THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERYONE CONVERTING TO CASH ACCOUNTS TO KNOW! Hope it helps.
    
    This will be another added factor as to why you should HODL! This is not financial advice in any way.

# Negative beta

Now in the pas few days something funny happened, reddit found out that due to the negative beta GME is reacting inversely to the market (meaning market go's up gme go's down and vice versa).Funny how we posted about that yesterday and I saw someone on here post that it ""suddenly"" corrected itself.

Now I'm the first to admit I don't have the exact technical knowledge to know whether or not this is normal behavior

But a smart ape did do a writeup on why the negative beta isn't as important as we first did believe

# A one two punch k.o. is comming.

u/heyitspixel did a great writeup on the new DTCC ruling and it's implications.

The new dtcc rules: [https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-003-Approval-Notice.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/DTC/SR-DTC-2021-003-Approval-Notice.pdf)

&#x200B;

[pixels post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m793h7/new_dtcc_rule_just_passed_in_effect_immediatly/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

&#x200B;

The great take-away from this post is written by  u/swede_child_of_mine

    This is probably punch one of the one-two punch from DTCC against Citadel & 
    naked options sellers (NOS's).
    
    Because this rule is effective immediately, Citadel & NOS need to report 
    to DTCC what their positions are, because you better believe DTCC didn't 
    change this rule to not use it.
    
    Punch two comes after either Citadel & NOS:
    
    1) Refuse to comply with the new rule
    
    2) Comply and reveal to DTCC the really ugly truthful numbers of their operations
    
    At that point, the DTCC will quickly turn to its stakeholders with strong cause to immediately pass SR-NSCC-2021-801 - the rule which would allow the DTCC to liquidate problematic firms whose operations expose the broader market to systemic damages.
    
    DTCC's interest might be in getting ahead of the next series of options writing, because it sees the damage exposure being brought by the NOSs.

ok but what about option 3? they lie?

    Yep. But my guess is DTCC has the receipts of Citadel & NOS's shenanigans. 
    There is too much data available to cover with a compelling lie, 
    especially to the people who are executing all of their securities trades.
    
    My guess is: DTCC knew they might lie and already has a compelling case 
    for grounds for their liquidations, which the bad actors can't lie their way out of.
    Even if they attempt to lie, the DTCC will turn around and say 
    ""These guys lied and are not complying. This is even more cause to liquidate.""
    
    Either way, I think the DTCC might be the biggest player in this whole thing, 
    and wants to get ahead of the next round of options issuance.

And I have to agree, everything I've seen from the new DTCC rules lines up with my beliefs that they are hedging their bets (see what I did there?) to make sure they're the ones who get out alive and well from this situation and Citadel is the one who's going to go down for their own problems.

**Addendum:**

Someone commented beneath pixel with some counter as to how it should be viewed, which is great!  u/the_captain_slog **posted:**

    I agree that this a good thing for the implications on the liquidity deposits,
     but your analysis is backwards.
    
    ""DTC provides regular reports and statements to Participants showing their
     settlement activity; this includes activity, risk control monitoring and
     settlement reports. The Procedures of DTC require Participants to reconcile 
    both their activity and positions with DTC upon receipt of applicable daily
     activity statements at the end of each day and to immediately report any
     discrepancies. Participants must also provide a month-end confirmation of 
    their activity.""
    
    The statements flow from DTCC to the hedge funds/participants. 
    It was not the hedge funds/participants providing statements once a month.
    
    Think of this like a bank statement. Your bank shows you online what all of 
    your activity is now on a daily basis, so you don't need to wait for a 
    month-end statement anymore (even though those are provided electronically 
    as well).
    
    Participants / hedge funds are now responsible to confirm the accuracy of 
    their statements and provide reconciliations of discrepancies daily: 
    
    ""It is the sole responsibility of Participants to perform a daily reconciliation
    of their activity and positions with the information, reports and statements
    provided by DTC. Participants must immediately report to DTC any discrepancy
    between their activity and positions with the information, 
    reports and statements provided by DTC or other issues relating to the accuracy of the information, reports and statements provided by DTC.""
    
    Here is the big part: This monthly confirmation had to happen 
    ""no later than the 10th business day after the last Friday of the month."" 
    It's very likely that they're now removing the buffer so they can do 
    the margin calls quicker. Before, there was a reasonable cover that 
    existed of ""Oh, I haven't reviewed and confirmed my statement yet."" 
    Now, that no longer exists. 
    They also now have daily confirmed statements showing any potential 
    issues / weaknesses that exist so they can do the margin calls on 
    more of a real-time basis.

# Patience is key

Ok so now we are closing up on the 19th the ""mystical"" witching day, this has been hyped up so much so expect it to go down. expect fuckery as always.

Expect the 19th to be the lowest day we have since yet seen.

Why am I saying this?

Easy, if we know the date THEY know the date.

all you need to do is sit back relax, get some nacho's for the dip and sit back.

This can take days, weeks or months.

Dr. Michael Burry had to wait 2 years for it to come out and his calculations to get paid out.

Expect the same, because if you expect the worst it can only get better.

volume is once again piss low. Even lower than expected in my opinion. This is great, but why?😎

To me, It shows that the hedge fund are running out of buying power, and apes are HODL strong. ✅

Right before major pops in gme, we saw volume decrease IMMENSELY. don’t forget, we saw volume go over 100 mil end of January. We are seeing a major decrease in volume, but the stock is trading sideways 🚨

Today is the earnings call, and from yesterday, I expected them to do every last thing they can to make GameStop look like a failed company via the stock market. So I pre-ordered the snazzy banana cat and picked up a few switch games 💎Personally, I just like the stock 🚀

Edit 10: seems as if my prediction was possibly correct, “do every last thing they can to make GameStop look like a failed company via the stock market”.

The short squeeze is going to create ~~ripples~~ Tsunamis across the market that might last months or even years.

1. The hedgies have borrowed an extraordinary amount of shares that they now have to buy back.
2. The hedgies will not have the money to buy back the shares
3. The hedgies will liquidate all their other positions
4. The hedgies will short any other stock they dont have positions in order to get some fast cash!
5. Now all the market is down while GME is being covered!
6. People will start buying the discounted stocks included the ones from step 4.

*This is not financial advice. Everything disclosed in the post was done by myself, with public information. I'm just making a DD smoothie for your smooth ape brains..*

**TL;DR- BlackRock is operating in a shadow market with Citadel and Bridgewater Associates. The three are contributing to the greatest market manipulation of all time, and the head of the snake (Citadel) is beginning to flail. I believe Citadel shorted the majority (if not 100%) of BlackRock's $GME portfolio, in addition to other highly shorted stonks, leaving BlackRock to hodl the bag.** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Before we start to finger-bang, you'll understand a lot more of this if I explain a few things. I promise I won't to turn this into an accounting/legal lecture, but if we're going to look for whales, you'll need to know how.

I'll be referencing a form called [SEC Schedule 13G](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp). This is used by institutional investors (like hedge funds) when they acquire more than 5% ownership in a company. Likewise, they would file a Schedule 13D if they bought 20% or more. Investors usually do this when they want to exert influence over the future operations of a company.

So, when a hedge fund buys between 5% - 15% of a company, it's usually just to milk their tendies and not influence their operations.

With me so far?

When a qualified institutional investor buys at least 5% of a company, they have to report it in their *Schedule 13G* within 45 days of year-end. The only exception is if they purchase more and it brings their total ownership above 10%. When this happens, they must file the 13G by the **end of the month** in which their ownership breached 10%.

Quick example:

1. Whale buys 5% of $GME in July 2020. They have to file a 13G within 45 days of 12/31/2020.
2. On October 15th 2020, they buy an additional 5% of $GME's outstanding shares. They now own 10% and must file their initial 13G within 10 days of 10/31/2020.
3. From this point on, any **change** (bought or sold) **of 5% or more** must be reported by the end of that month in which the change was made.

Now buckle up apes: I'm bout' to wrinkle that smooth brain.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I started investigating $GME's [13Fs](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/browse/?CIK=0001326380) from 2020 to find out who the biggest whales are. As discussed above, those owning more than 10% would have to file an amended 13G if they bought or sold more than 5%. This would tell us which whales are still in the fight.

Here's what I found..

Whales travel in pods. Although they may not communicate together, they *think* together... It's important to note that most whales will start *paperhanding* parts of their portfolios when a stonk isn't performing... it's basic investing... and during 2020, $GME wasn't a very attractive buy.. (thank god for u/deepfuckingvalue).

Some *bearish* whales include Dimensional Fund Advisors, Vanguard Group, and State Street Corp.. Not only did they NOT BuY tHe DiP, but most of their sales occurred evenly throughout the year which signals a bearish position.

1. Dimensional Fund Advisors LP
   1. Owner since Q2 2003
   2. Holds [5.6417%](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000035420421000127/SEC13G_Filing.htm) of $GME as of Q4 2020 (drop from 7.0627% in Q4 2018)
2. Vanguard Group
   1. Owner since Q2 of 2002
   2. Holds [7.4012%](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000110465921018148/tv0931-gamestopcorpclassa.htm) of $GME as of Q4 2020 (drop from 10.5198% in Q4 2019)
3. State Street Corp
   1. Owner since Q1 of 2001
   2. Holds [3.5058%](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000009375121000355/GameStopCorp.txt) of $GME as of Q4 2020 (drop from 4.2532% in Q4 2019)

In contrast, we had another whale pod that most definitely BoUgHt ThE dIp during 2020; several for the first time.

1. The silverback himself- Ryan Cohen
   1. Aggregate shares of [9,001,000](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000119380520001580/xslF345X03/e620155_4-gme.xml) as of Q4 2020.
2. Maverick Capital LTD
   1. Owner since Q1 2020
   2. HODLs [6.6793%](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000119312521044436/d120770dsc13g.htm) ownership, 1.4053% of entire portfolio (25 highest / 832 in portfolio)
   3. Increased holdings by *164.11%* since Q1
3. Senvest Management, LLC
   1. Owner since Q3 2020
   2. HODLs [7.2418%](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000090266421001289/p21-0581sc13ga.htm)
4. Morgan Stanley
   1. Owner since Q1 2002
   2. HODLs 6.1305% of $GME as of Q4 2020
   3. Increase of [114.24%](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/morgan-stanley) since Q4 2019

Although these are bull whales and we *want* to believe they are trying to force a squeeze (not saying they *aren't)*, the SAFEST assumption is that they realized GameStop was *extremely* undervalued and wanted to get in while the tendies were frying... Regardless, we can't really tell if they are still holding because an amended 13G is only filed for these guys at year-end.. Unless they bought more than 10% of outstanding shares, but I haven't seen a recent amendment for any of them..

ANYWAY, IT MATTERS NOT!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One of the biggest $GME owners at the end of 2019 was FMR, LLC (fidelity)... They owned [9,267,087](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/fmr-llc).. I didn't realize they just transferred 100% of the position into another side of the company. Tricky to catch that...

At any rate, this left us with only one chickontender.... **BlackRock, Inc.**

According to their most recent 13F on 12/31/2020, BlackRock had $3,134,881,697,000 (yeah, trillion) in assets. If you check page 4 of their annual [10K](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001364742/c7a7c1bc-6afa-4e2a-929e-aa2af777caeb.pdf), they list **$8,676,680,000,000** in assets under management (AUM)...

Now Citadel and BlackRock go way back.. Several of BlackRock's employees ended up working at Citadel, and vise-versa. Check out [Navneet Arora](https://www.citadel.com/leadership/dr-navneet-arora/), for example. He's the current Head of Global Quantitative Strategies at Citadel and previously served as Managing Director and Global Head of Model-Based Credit Research at BlackRock....

....Are you ready for this?

There was an [article](http://alphacution.com/blackrock-bridgewater-citadel-and-the-decline-of-speculation-at-scale/) published by Alphacution in 2019 which explained the shadow-relationship between BlackRock, Citadel, and Bridgewater. Long story short, the author weaves the thread between all three firms and shows how their coordinated efforts are rigging the game for big money. BlackRock (the beta) provides trillion-dollar asset bases which are pushed through Bridgewater's (the Asymmetric Alpha) quantitative management zone. Citadel (the Structural Alpha) then acts as the market maker (through Citadel Securities) and rigs the market by serving them the most favorable trades using their high-frequency trading platforms.... If you haven't read my first article [Citadel Has No Clothes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/), please do so.

Want proof? In February 2020, Bloomberg published an [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-21/citadel-blackrock-win-battle-over-speed-bump-in-stock-trades) showing how companies like Citadel, BlackRock, and the Royal Bank of Canada (former CEO of Royal Bank is now on the board of BlackRock) were able to shut down a proposal by the CBOE which tried to implement a four-millisecond delay in it's EDGA exchange. This would take a HUGE ADVANTAGE out of Citadel's high frequency platform and presented a systemic risk to their secretive three-way affair.

So guess who shut down the proposal? **The F\*CKING SEC.**

https://preview.redd.it/gv3nsyh1tqn61.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=baccef76487c9a217e27529dcf49666dfb8a2b39

.....Makes me sick to watch a House Committee meeting where the SEC shills just shrug their shoulders and say *""we'll get to the bottom of these matters""*... like you don't already know about it..

Anyway, BlackRock, Bridgewater, and Citadel are basically best friends. BlackRock cooks & serves the tendies, Bridgewater packages the order for the customer, and Citadel provides coupons at the register. Now how does this tie back into $GME?

Let's review:

1. BlackRock is the Moby Dick of GameStop and brick n' mortar stores weren't doing too well in 2020..
2. Throughout the year, they liquidated [18.23%](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme/blackrock) of their $GME position
   1. Q1 balance of 11,271,702 shares
   2. Q4 balance of 9,217,335 shares
      1. This is a reduction of 2,054,367 shares / 11,271,702 shares (18.23% decrease)
3. Citadel & Friends decided to short 140% of GameStop by borrowing shares from asset managers like BlackRock. Gabe Plotkin even ADMITTED they do this with asset funds like BlackRock during the 1st Committee Meeting and Bloomberg wrote an [article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-06/the-biggest-players-in-the-short-selling-game-are-getting-a-pass) about it
4. When stocks aren't performing well, asset managers like BlackRock will make money by charging a [high interest rate](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) on lending shares for highly shorted stocks
5. Citadel Securities pockets the proceeds from selling the short shares and never plans on repurchasing them after GameStop goes bankrupt
6. BlackRock makes more money on the high interest rate than they would on the sale of their declining $GME shares, and everyone gets a good ol' fashioned hand job before sleeping soundly at night...

The only problem is that Ryan Cohen stepped in to challenge Moby Dick... Whether intentionally or not, Ryan more than likely prevented the entire collapse of GameStop when he purchased 9,001,000 shares during 2020....

In addition to the number of autists hodling shares, his purchase GUARANTEED that 9,001,000 shares would NOT be sold through paperhanded FUDers. I know there are other significant stocks with high short volumes and I'd bet my left nut that BlackRock did the same thing to them. Now would be a great time for BlackRock to sell their shares of $GME when the price is +$200, but wait.... THEY DON'T HAVE THEM. If they sold a significant part of their portfolio, like they were doing throughout 2020, they would have filed an amended 13G to show the reduction. I'd bet my right nut that BlackRock lent most, if not 100% of their shares and Citadel left them HODLing the bag.

""But BlackRock has waaaaay more money than Citadel. Surely they'll be fine""

Wrong. BlackRock is not an investment bank- they manage assets. Their primary business is to network and gather large amounts of money, then package it within various investment vehicles. Their total revenue for 2020 was $16,205,000,000 (with a B) and while this sounds impressive, it's peanuts compared to the $8 trillion in assets on their balance sheet. In fact, the actual net income attributable to BlackRock was less than $5,000,000,000 (with a B).... Imagine BlackRock as a giant tendie warehouse, but without a distribution network.... That's where Bridgewater and Citadel Securities step in.

[BlackRock, LLC 2020 10K](https://preview.redd.it/4qp4mne0ern61.jpg?width=547&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=476a699098b444bd1f3b0a3018fe9bd16354b93e)

So where does this leave us now...

Citadel is hemorrhaging funds like there's no tomorrow. In addition to all of this, they just [issued $600,000,000](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/hg-bonds-citadel-finance-places-600m-of-notes-in-bond-market-debut-terms-62989441) in 5 year bonds on March 3rd... For a company that manages ""$384 billion in assets"", this seems ridiculous... It's more likely that the head of the snake is choking on it's own venom and BlackRock could cease to have a dominant market-maker for that $3 trillion asset fund.. It's literally poetic justice.

This turbulence between BlackRock and Citadel can only end poorly for them... BlackRock built a supply chain relationship with Citadel and Citadel obviously needs an asset manager. Don't believe me? *76.7%* of Citadel's portfolio are DERIVATIVES! BETS on the outcomes of the market!... less than 25% are actual, physical shares! Imagine driving a car without gas; running a marathon without eating; landing on the moon without tendies... Of course, BlackRock will cash in a moon shot once they receive their shares, but it will cripple their biggest market maker in return.

Speaking of which....

Citadel has owned shares of BlackRock (BLK) since Q3 of 2008. Their business relationship started at a rather *peculiar* time if you ask me. Although it has fluctuated since at least Q4 2018 (earliest I can see) , they just sold off [48.31%](https://fintel.io/so/us/blk/citadel-advisors-llc) of their BLK portfolio and own 206,500 BLK puts to 135,700 BLK calls (1.52 put/call).. For those who don't know... 1.52 is an EXTREMELY high put ratio. They've actually had a large put ratio on BlackRock for quite a while... anything over 0.7 signals bearish, and anything over 1 is treated like a dumpster fire. It's like Citadel knows that BlackRock is screwed without a mule like Citadel Securities.

*""Want to know what you get out of it? You get the ice cream, the hot fudge, the banana, and the nuts. Right now, I get the sprinkles, and yeah, if this goes through, I get the cherry. But you get the Sundae, Vinnie. You get the sundae""*

*- Jared Vennett, The Big Short (2015)*

Unfortunately, BlackRock never got their tendies and are probably PISSED that their business partner didn't handle their end of the deal... Even though $GME was a small portion of their portfolio, it was declining in value. Not to mention all of the other assets that were lent as highly shorted stocks... They made a few bucks on the high loan % but it wasn't for long...

And now the table is set.... Citadel is gasping for air, BlackRock is at risk of losing a major partnership with a dominant market maker, and the DTCC just started ringing the dinner bell...

* How can there be more than 100% of the float/shares sold short? (And is it possible without naked shorting?)
* How do the short sellers keep up the naked shorting?
* Do the short sellers have to buy *every single share* to cover?
* Will I get to sell my shares at any price I want?
* **What is the best exit strategy?**

# But where's the TLDR?

I will not provide a TLDR, but I will throw in some bullet points to summarize each question along the way. If you read the bullet points, you should get the essence of it.

If you think you know the answer to all of the above questions, I suggest you just look for the bullet points, and see if you agree. If you don't, you can read more, if you still don't agree, we can have an interesting conversation in the comment section.

**At least scroll down and read the part with the big diamonds!** (Near the bottom.)

# A note on terminology

I hate the very idea of short selling, and often use the derogatory term **'Shit'** when referring to a short seller, and pretend it's an abbreviation for *'Short selling Hedge fund, Investor or Trader'* or some BS like that. Other than that, I'll try to define each abbreviation where I use them.

# 🚀 Are my shares real?

I'll use the following 4-step illustrating to explain this stuff. (You don't need to understand all of it, I'll explain every step eventually.)

&#x200B;

[4-step illustration of short selling](https://preview.redd.it/x50tp2fm7xr61.png?width=2765&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea40db4bbb9681aa778ca4870c8641902fceba2b)

**Step 1:** There are 70M shares issued by the company (the shares outstanding), no shares are sold short, and no apes are confused.

**Step 2:** Some Shits come and borrow a bunch of shares and sell them! Whoa! Who owns the shares now? Are there any fake shares? Apes be confuse!

First, those who *bought* from the Shits get the actual, real shares. The Shits didn't have any shares, and still has no shares. The tricky part is the ones who *lent* the shares. If they file their holdings to the SEC at this point, they would actually still list these shares in their holdings, just as they would before they were lent out. In fact, if *all* shareholders were to report their positions at this point, and 40M shares were borrowed and sold short, then a total of 70M+40M=110M shares would be reported as being owned, even though there are only 70M real shares! In this way, **short selling adds shares** to the pool of shares on the market.

But since the shares were lent out, **the lenders don't actually** ***have*** **the shares**. For example, they will not be allowed to use their shares to vote at the annual shareholders' meeting. But they still *own the right* to the shares, more specifically, **they have the right to** ***recall*** **them at any time they want.** Recalling is the lender saying ""Hey, Shit! Give me my shares back!"" and the Shit has no choice but to do so. A lender will usually only recall their shares if they plan to use them for voting, or if they want to sell them. Note that lenders are free to sell their shares at any time, since they can just recall them to deliver them to the buyer!

The Shit, however, does not have to get *the same* shares back when they are recalled, since all shares on the market are interchangeable. The Shit may go and buy shares in the market, or find someone else to borrow them from, to get their hands on real shares to give back to the lender.

*(The terminology here is really confusing, but many would call the lenders' shares ""synthetic"" at this point. But the term ""synthetic shares"" can mean a number of other things too, so if I just called them synthetic, a horde of apes would spam the comment section screaming ""That's not what synthetic shares are!"", so I will try to refer to them simply as ""lent"".)*

**What did we learn?**

* If you bought shares, **you own real shares!** (Unless your broker lends out your shares.)
* **The lenders don't own any actual shares, but have the right to** ***recall*** **them,** **and are free to sell them at any time.** They just have to recall them when they sell.
* **Short selling increases the number of shares on the market**, both the lender and the buyer will report that they own them.

# 🚀 Is there any point in buying more shares when there are no real shares left?

Simple answer: Yes!

The ""no real shares left"" part is actually a myth. From the above lesson, we learned that **the shares being sold are the real shares**. If they originate from someone lending them for shorting, the *lender* is stuck with ""fake"" shares, not the buyer! As a buyer, you will never know where your shares came from, you only know that you own the shares. In a way, you could rather say that *only* the real shares are left to buy.

**What did we learn?**

* **There are always real shares left.** If you buy shares, you always get real shares.

# 🚀 Can short sellers cover using fake/counterfeit shares?

Simple answer: No, that's just not possible.

Many apes have asked me, that with all their trickery, isn't it possible that those Shits may cover their shorts using fake or counterfeit shares? I have read many suggestions on how people imagine the Shits could trick their way out of all of this, but all the suggestions have some flaw(s), based on a lack of understanding of either the basic principles of shorting, or the technicalities regarding how trades are actually executed. At best, the suggested scam only moves the responsibility to deliver the shares around, and/or extends the deadline to deliver them, and this kind of behavior *is* observed with GME. But this is like tossing a hot potato around, the potato doesn't disappear until someone swallows it.

The simple truth is that the only way to *really* cover a short sale is to deliver back an *actual* share to the lender. (Only exception to this rule is if the lender sells their shares to the very same Shit that borrowed them, in which case they will end up owing each other the same amount of shares, and the short sale is closed without any shares changing hands. This is like paying for a book you never returned to the library.)

**What did we learn?**

* **The only way to cover a short position is to deliver a real share to the lender,** or buy the share from the lender.

# 🚀 How can there be more than 100% of the float/shares sold short? (And is it possible without naked shorting?)

Some people claim that any shares sold short after the entire float is shorted are ""fake"" or ""counterfeit"" or something like that, you even see apes who provide otherwise excellent DD say something like this from time to time. This is simply not true!

Let's look at the illustration from the beginning of the post again. In step 2, 40M shares were borrowed and sold short, and we'll assume that these were *all* the shares that were available for borrowing at this point. The remaining 30M shares are held by someone who does not allow their shares to be borrowed. After step 2, these 30M real shares remain, but there are also 40M real shares that are now held by ""new owners"", and they may very well want to lend their shares! (Remember, they don't know if their shares originated from a short sale or a long sale, all they know is that they bought the shares, and can do with them as they please.) Let's say 25M of these 40M become available to be borrowed, and 15M don't. (We're now at **Step 3** in the illustration.) 65M shares are sold short, this is almost all of the shares outstanding, and significantly more than the float (usually the float for GME is estimated to be around 45M shares). But in theory, this process could go on indefinitely, as long as new buyers allow their shares to be lent. If more than 5M of the 25M shares sold short in step 3 were borrowed and sold short again, there would be more than the shares outstanding sold short, without any shady business!

At this point I'll throw in some mafs, just so you'll assume my brain has wrinkles, and you'll accept everything I say as the absolute truth.

>If X is the fraction of shareholders who allow their shares to be borrowed, and this fraction is the same for ""new buyers"", then the theoretical limit *L* for how much of the shares that may be borrowed and sold short is given by:  
>  
>*L* =  (X + X^(2) \+ X^(3) \+ X^(4 +) ...) = X / (1-X)  
>  
>If X = 0.2 (only 20% of all shares are available to be borrowed), we get:  
>  
>*L* =  0.2 / (1 - 0.2) = 0.25, or 25%  
>  
>meaning 25% of all shares can be sold short.  
>  
>If X = 0.8 (as much as 80% of all shares are available to be borrowed), we get:  
>  
>*L* = 0.8 / (1 - 0.8) = 4, or 400%  
>  
>meaning **all shares could be shorted 4 times** before running out of shares to borrow!

*(This is very simplified. Different kinds of owners, like insideres, institutions and ETFs, have vastly different likelihood of lending their shares.)*

**What did we learn?**

* In theory, \*\*the entire float could be shorted many times over without breaking any rules (\*\****without*** **naked shorting)**, as long as enough shareholders are willing to lend out their shares.
* Since not all shareholders allow their shares to be borrowed, the short sellers will at some point run out of shareholders to borrow from, and can only keep selling short if they resort to naked shorting. (This is illegal, but those Shits still do it).

# 🚀 How do the short sellers keep up the naked shorting?

Many big actors on Wall Street, including our ""beloved"" Shitadel (Citadel Securities LLC, a huge hedge fund that largely bases their business on short selling), have been fined multiple times for playing dirty, but they don't stop. They just consider the fines ""the cost of doing business"" and continue to fuck over everyone they can squeeze a cent out of. The simple fact is that naked shorting, even though illegal, occurs on a daily basis, partly because the rules allow for too much slack, partly because Shits don't give a fuck. Evidence points to this happening on a *massive* scale with GME. But how does it work? This is insanely complicated, so I'll only scratch the surface on this one, but it will still be a wall of text.

When you buy shares, it usually looks like you get the shares immediately in your trading account. But in reality, all trades are actually executed (or ""cleared"") on the second business day after the trade occurred, denoted **T+2.** This basically means that the buyer (or the broker) has two days to come up with the cash, and the seller has two days to deliver the shares. Almost all trades are executed through a clearing house (DTCC). When you buy a share, the trade is sent to the clearing house, who issues an **IOU, a ""fake share""** to the buyer, which is more or less just a promise that a share will be delivered. Then they wait for the seller to actually deliver the share within T+2 days. Once the share is delivered, money goes to the seller, and the share goes to the buyer. All this happens ""in the background"", you'll never know if you have a real share or an IOU assigned to you, but you should assume that your newly bought shares are only IOUs for the first three days (the day you bought them and the following two business days). So, **even if nothing shady is going on, there are always millions of ""fake shares"" (IOUs) out there**, simply because millions of shares change hands every day, and trades aren't cleared yet. But without short selling, an IOU is always paired with a real share in the seller's account, it is simply not delivered yet.

The problems only start when shares are sold short, and the seller hasn't bothered to borrow them. (This is **Step 4** in the illustration.) The Shits don't worry about such tiny, insignificant details like owning what they sell, and the rules only say they must think it is probable that they will find the shares somewhere in time. If the short seller is unable to borrow shares, the seller will **fail to deliver** the shares in time, which will make DTCC really upset, and they may even start crying. (Or they may revoke some of the Shit's short selling privileges until they deliver the shares, or even go buy the shares in the market on their own to force the seller to close the short sale, and bill the seller for any losses, or something like that. Boring stuff, who cares, point is that:) **Nobody wants that!**

So what do the Shits do in this situation? Do they realize they had no right to sell those shares in the first place, and buy the shares back to close their position, like any reasonable person would? Of course not! They go to a market maker and says ""Hey, if I give you a little cash, could you pretend for a while that you sold me some shares?"" The market makers, whose primary task is to provide [option contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) to those who want them, have more privileges than most, which is intended to maintain the liquidity of the options market, i.e. to make sure anyone can buy options when they want. And of course, if they can make some money by exploiting these privileges, many market makers are happy to oblige. Now this is *really* complicated, but if you feel you have enough wrinkles in your brain for it, you can read [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/) to learn exactly how they do it. I'll just try to give you the general idea of how they pull it off:

>A Shit sells a share short. Shit now has two days to deliver a share to DTCC. Two days later, the Shit still doesn't have the share. The shit goes to a market maker (MM), and they agree that for a small premium, the MM will sell a share to the Shit, so the Shit can deliver it to the DTCC, but the Shit must in return also sell a share to the MM. (They do this using options and some trickery, to camouflage what they are up to.) The trade saying the Shit bought a share from the MM is sent to the DTCC, and the deadline from the short sale is considered met, and DTCC is happy. The MM now owes a share to the DTCC, but then the trade saying the Shit sold a share to the MM is also sent to the DTCC. Now the MM both owes a share and is owed a share, so this cancels out, the MM has done their job and earned some quick bucks, and is now out of the picture. But the Shit still owes one share to the DTCC, the one sold to the MM, and has a new deadline of two days to deliver it, since this is a new trade. Final result: the same amount of shares is owed to the same people from the same people, but the deadline is extended. In this way, the Shit is able to kick the can down the road. This process can be repeated almost indefinitely, as long as the Shit can pay off the MM to keep doing this, and in some cases, they are able to extend the deadline a lot more than two days at a time.

If you still didn't understand anything, it's okay, just know that **the Shits are able to extend the deadline for delivering shares after naked short sales, by paying off (bribing) market makers** who are in on it, by doing some tricks with options, etc. (This is what all the ""deep ITM options"" talk is all about.) It costs the Shits money to keep this up, but less than buying shares when the price has gone up a lot. This stuff is illegal, not too well hidden, and new rules recently issued by DTCC has also made it a lot more difficult to keep up. *(Some posters here have claimed that it will soon be impossible to keep this up, and some have already pointed out a decline of volume for deep ITM options, but we'll just have to wait and see. They know many tricks, those Shits...)*

So short selling creates ""fake shares"", shares that are only promised to be delivered, but who gets them? Well, nobody and everybody. The DTCC does. You see, the DTCC doesn't keep track of every single share and every single shareholder in a one-to-one relationship like you may imagine. Shares are just like money in this sense, completely interchangeable. You can think of it like the DTCC simply has a record of all the shareholders who *should* have shares, as well of records of who *owes* shares, and who *is owed* shares. Like you may go to the bank and withdraw cash from your account, you can get your shares from the DTCC when you need them, e.g. when you sell your shares. And just like your Bank won't have enough cash in their vaults to match the value of all their deposit accounts, the DTCC won't always have enough shares to match the positions of all shareholders combined. And just like the liquidity of your bank is nothing you ever need to worry about, how DTCC does all their transactions is **not anything you need to worry about!** Just know that **you can sell your shares whenever you want, and you** ***will*** **get the money** for them, no matter how many ""fake shares"" there may be in existence. This business with fake shares, naked shorting, etc. may in the end cause huge losses for many ""innocent"" parties when this rocket lifts off, like the DTCC and their members, but *never* for the shareholders! I won't go into any details, but there are a number of mechanisms in place to ensure this. The shareholders are the most protected party in all of this mess.

**What did we learn?**

* **There are** ***always*** **lots of ""fake"" shares out there,** called IOUs, simply because of the way trades are executed.
* Naked short selling creates more ""fake"" shares (IOUs), but the **short sellers have a deadline to deliver actual shares**.
* **Short sellers are able to pay off market makers to help them extend this deadline** again and again, pretty much indefinitely, as long as they can afford it. This is illegal, but definitely happening.
* **You don't ever have to worry about whether you own real or ""fake"" shares.** **You can always sell your shares, and will always get your money for them.**

# 🚀 Do the short sellers have to buy back every single share?

Simple answer: No, just the same amount as they sold short.

This quickly gets a bit complicated, but I'll do my best to explain. For short sellers to close their position, or ""cover"" as it is often referred to, they must deliver back *real shares* to whomever they borrowed from. If they borrowed and sold 10M shares, they must buy 10M shares and give them back. If they shorted 100M, they must buy back 100M. And in the end, when all Shits have covered, there will be 70M shares left, the same amount that was issued in the first place. But even if the float has been shorted several times, it is still very possible that some shares are not involved in this process at all!

At step 3 in the illustration, there are 135M shares on the market, and they have to get it back down to 70M as in step 1 to cover all their positions. Suppose the Shits do the exact reverse of step 3 and 2 (in that order) in the illustration. Now all shorts are covered, and all is well, but note that the 30M shares that was not lent out in step 2 were never involved in the process of shorting and covering. And the 40M shares that were lent out to be sold short in step 2 were held by the same people the whole time (the lenders), and were not bought back. This sums up to 70M shares (the total number of shares outstanding) that were not bought to cover! **Even if the entire float was shorted many times over, some portion of the shares may never be involved in this process at all, and 70M shares (the number of originally issued shares) will never be bought to cover**. If the Shits have shorted more than the float, this simply means they have to buy back some shares more than once. More specifically, they must buy some shares and return to one lender, then buy shares from this lender to give to another lender, and so on, until all lenders have gotten their shares back.

**It doesn't matter to the short sellers** ***which*** **shares they buy to cover**. If they buy real shares, then great! If they buy shares that have been lent out, the lender must recall the shares and deliver them, and the short seller still gets real shares to give back, so also great! (If the shares were lent to the short seller in question in the first place, they will end up owing each other the same amount of shares when the lender recalls, so it just cancels out. If it was lent to a different short seller, the other short seller is now forced to cover to deliver them.)

**What did we learn?**

* No matter how many shares are sold short, **not all shares must be bought to cover**. The number of shares outstanding (almost 70M for GME) will not be bought back in the end.
* It doesn't matter to the short sellers *which* shares they buy, **they just have to buy the same amount as they sold short.**
* Even shares that are lent out can be bought to cover, it just means that the lender who sells them must recall the shares, which will force more shares to be covered.

# 🚀 Will I get to sell my shares at any price I want?

Simple answer: No. Unless you personally own all shares outstanding, the price you'll be able to sell at depends on others.

This is not easy to explain in a sentence or two, and I actually wrote [an entire DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhjfee/mythbuster_dd_can_you_set_the_price_for_your/) on the subject a few days ago, but I'll give you the essence of it here.

I already concluded above in the section *""Do the short sellers have to buy back every single share?""* that they don't. This means, for example, that if you set your price to a trillion dollars, and everybody else are willing to sell for 100 million, you will never get to sell your share, no matter how many shares are sold short. As I tried to explain using the 4-step illustration, short selling adds shares to the original shares outstanding. Simply put, this means that no matter how many shares are sold short, 70M shares (the number of shares outstanding) will not be bought back when the short sellers cover. For example, if 100M shares are sold short, then there will be 170M shares ""out there"" owned by some person or entity, and any of those 170M shares could be put up for sale, and the short sellers must only buy 100M of those to cover all their positions. If all shareholders simultaneously offered their shares for sale at the price they desired for each share, and all the short sellers bought all the shares they needed to cover, **the 70M most expensive shares would not be bought.** By this simple observation, one could assume that the peak price of the squeeze will be determined by the 70 millionth most expensive share among all shareholders (but it's not that simple, at least there's a lot of psychology involved as well).

**But not only apes will be holding those 70M shares!** Some shares will *never* be put up for sale, at least not under normal circumstances. We can only speculate on how many shares are truly ""locked up"", but I would say that it's safe to assume that Ryan Cohen won't be selling any of his 9M shares any time soon, ETFs have specific rules and dates to do their rebalancing, market makers are holding shares for hedging, and many big whales are holding shares for the long run, and don't really care for the ""mood swings"" of the market. All this will significantly contribute to the squeeze, as the short seller must buy back a larger portion of the shares that *are* available on the market, at the very least, this will significantly raise the price of the 70M most expensive shares, and thus increase the peak of the squeeze.

**But what if the entire float is held by someone who refuses to sell?**

The diamond handed apes are what separates GME from anything previously seen in the history of squeezing. We have already established that the most expensive shares will determine the peak of the squeeze, and just holding shares will definitely contribute massively to the squeeze. But **if all the shares outstanding were held by truly diamond handed apes** (together with insiders like Ryan Cohen, ETFs, and possibly some funds and long whales), **who simply refuse to sell** their shares, **THAT is when the short sellers would be in REAL trouble!** This would mean that there would be less shares available than they need to cover, and they would be forced to buy *every single remaining share*, no matter the price, and would still not be able to cover! This is often referred to as an **infinite squeeze**. This would truly be the Mother Of All Short Squeezes (MOASS), I'm even willing to put a few extra MO's in front of that! If you really want to squeeze those Shits, *this* is the scenario you should aim for.

**Is the infinite squeeze a realistic scenario?**

I cannot factually answer this question. There are just too many factors involved, and too little reliable data to accurately estimate these factors, the most important factor being how many shares are actually held by retail investors, and how many of those actually have true diamond hands. (Unfortunately, this is a scenario many apes out there are already taking for granted, like in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mmg5sr/500_million_per_share_is_not_a_meme_i_am_dead/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which is trending today, but this is dangerous thinking!) In my opinion, a *literal* infinite squeeze can never happen. At some point, the price will reach levels where even the most diamond handed ape, insider or investor would sell. So the infinite squeeze is more like an utopia than a realistic scenario, *if you ask me.*

But in my last DD titled ""[The MOASS is inevitable!](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mjo3jj/the_moass_is_inevitable/)"" I argued that even with very conservative estimates, it seems very likely that retail *does* own the entire float, quite possibly even all shares outstanding. We can't say for sure how much retail owns, and we can't say how diamond handed the average retail investor will be when this starts to squeeze. But apes don't need to own everything, and **the short interest does not have to be several hundred percent**, for this to squeeze extremely hard. In fact, what I sincerely believe is that **this will squeeze harder than anything we've ever seen!** The squeeze will just keep going as long as retail continues to control the float, by **holding**. And every share with a ""ridiculous"" price target will increase the peak of the squeeze!

And there's one important thing to notice here: this does not really depend *that* much on how big the short interest is! A higher short interest simply means that more shares must be bought, but the infinite squeeze could happen with just a single share sold short! **The most important factor is how many shares that are held by diamond hands!**

**What did we learn?**

* **This will squeeze harder than anything we've ever seen!** Even by conservative estimates, the numbers say we're in for a *massive* squeeze!
* Still, **you can't just ""name your price""**, the 70M most expensive shares will never be bought. If you set your price at 1 trillion, you simply won't get to sell.

# 🚀 What is the best exit strategy?

One of my favorite movie scenes is from ""A Beautiful Mind"" when John Nash (Russel Crowe) realizes that **""the best result will come from everyone in the group doing what's best for themselves AND for the group"".** This *""Equilibrium Game Theory""* is highly relevant here. If all apes acted to maximize the gains only for *themselves*, everyone would just try to sell before everyone else, because in the end, 70M shares will not be bought, and nobody would want to be left bagholding any of those. The result would be that this would never squeeze at all, and *nobody* would get any tendies. On the other hand, if *nobody* thought of themselves, nobody would sell, but keep holding to maintain the squeeze, and even if this would become the biggest squeeze ever, *nobody* would get any tendies, because nobody sold. The point is, **if apes want max tendies, apes need to find the middle ground between looking out for themselves, and looking out for the group.**

I can't tell you what to do with *your* money, and *your* shares, and you're ultimately on your own when it comes to the decision to sell. What I *can* say is that **this squeeze will only reach its full potential by holding as many shares as possible for as long as possible**. The peak of the squeeze will be determined collectively, and all apes will benefit the most from collectively holding on to all shares as long as possible.

# 💎💎💎My theory is that apes collectively will maximize their profits if they aim to keep holding most of their shares to the very end, and only sell off a small fraction of their shares AFTER they believe it has peaked! 💎💎💎

We know that the more shares that are kept off the market, the harder this will squeeze. It will be tempting to start selling off shares quite early to secure some profits, cover the original investment, etc., but if *all* apes do this, it will significantly reduce the squeeze! By continuing to hold on to *all* shares, the squeeze will probably peak literally more than 10 times higher, which means that apes can sell less than 10% of their shares for the same number of tendies, and apes will still have more than 90% of the shares left to keep the squeeze going! I mean, **instead of selling 10 shares at 100k to get 1M, it is FAR BETTER for both you and for other apes if you sell** ***one*** **share at 1M and have 9 shares left!** This will maintain the squeeze for much longer, and make sure all apes get serious tendies! With the 90% remaining shares, each ape can then wait to see if it squeezes even higher, or *slowly* sell on the way down, without causing the price to plummet, or just keep them because the ape already got tendies, and the ape likes the stock!

>Say the price peaks at 1M, and an ape with 10 shares sells 1 share at 1M, and then one share every time the price is halved, the ape will then end up with (1M + 500k + 250k + 125k + ...)  ≈ 2M! That's a doubling, using probably the most relaxed strategy there is, and without causing any harm to fellow apes!

Even if you don't completely buy my theory, I believe there are some general guidelines that will benefit both you and all other apes when the time comes to sell:

* **Never sell on the way up!** Selling on the way up will take fuel from the rocket, reduce the squeeze, reduce the peak, and ultimately reduce your own returns. Every share you sell before the true peak is reached will reduce the peak. Only start selling when you believe the peak has been reached!
* **Be prepared for some turbulence!** The way to the highest peak will probably not be a straight line, and dips are to be expected even after the rocket has launched. (Just imagine what it would look like if a major whale decides to cash in at a point. The price would stagnate or even dip significantly, but the squeeze won't be over until the apes say it's over!)
* **Never sell all at once!** If you sell off your entire position at once, not only will you ease the squeeze, and contribute to a plummeting price, you may also miss out on the true peak.
* **Sell as slowly as you can!** If you sell only a small fraction of your shares at a time, you will help maintain the peak of the squeeze for as long as possible, and help your fellow apes get some tendies as well.
* **Believe in the MOASS!** Lack of faith is what causes paper handing and panic selling. The squeeze is a self-fulfilling prophecy. *You* decide when to stop squeezing using your shares!
* **Trust your fellow apes!** Apes together strong! In the end, squeezing those Shits is a collective effort, and the peak of the squeeze will be determined by the collective effort of all apes. If you trust that your fellow apes are holding, you will hold too!
* **Don't listen to anyone saying the squeeze is over until it is over!** The MSM, maybe even our subs, will be overrun by people telling you to ""cash in before it's too late"", or anything that will convince you that the squeeze is over, and all other apes are selling. **Don't you dare believe them!** Stay calm, stick to your plan, and follow all the above guidelines. This is not over until it's over!

Since this whole GME situation started, we’ve seen a bunch of numbers thrown around. 10.000, 100.000, 1.000.000, 10.000.000 etc. 

For a lot of us, including myself, these numbers seem wiiild and surreal to think that we have a chance to get it. Seeing these numbers on a screen for months obviously isnt real and most of us are probably numb to numbers at this point (red or green) which is good! That means we wont be too emotionally attached when the its squeeze time and theyre on your trading acc. 

BUT, I think its time to realize this is REAL. These are REAL numbers. We all have a LEGITIMATE shot at becoming millionaires. A golden ticket to become *actual* millionaires. Its hard to imagine, I know, but think about it. 

Sit back and think this very well could be the last month/year of living paycheck to paycheck, struggling with rent or having to pass on a social event bc you cant afford it. 
THIS IS IT. 
So buy and hold and dont sell until you reach that point.

**Edit 32 6:03PM:**

My fellow apes. **The Bloomberg Terminal data looks good**. NOTHING TO FEAR. (edit: seems most retailers and funds holding).  (edit: possible longs with outdated filings: Maverick, Senvest, Morgan Stanley)

Price already rebounding AH!

**Edit 31 4:01PM:**

Ended around 120 for the day. Will keep you all posted on what I find out in the Bloomberg Terminal.

**Edit 30 3:59PM:**

You might lose for the day, but stonks go up long term ;)

**Edit 29 3:44PM:**

We're net bullish now in terms of options activity. Still down for the day, but hey, you lose some and you win some. Welcome to investing!

**Edit 28 3:41PM:**

1 million worth of Call volume traded at the 150 strike. I'm seeing an evening out between bullish and bearish bets. Again I believe a reversal is close.

**Edit 27 3:38PM:**

Yes we're down a lot today. There is a dissonance between the price and the earnings call though. Keep that in mind. Earnings suggests a P/E increase while we're seeing a maneuver for a P/E decrease. On OptionSonar I'm seeing a flow of Calls trickling. Very interesting to me.

I am still **holding**.

**Edit 26 3:34PM:**

116.5 next support.

**Edit 25 3:27PM:**

Not a happy day for the market.

**Edit 24 3:18PM:**

Let's talk about how companies are valued. A lot of e-commerce stocks trade at high Price/Earnings multiples. So like 20x for example. I believe that with the recent move into e-commerce, that will lead to analysts raising their P/E expectations and raising the price targets.

We saw recently how Jeffries increased they price target to $175 at a discounted P/E compared to other e-commerce companies. I believe that with Q1, more analysts will be able to raise their price targets as they see GameStop proving their worth as a e-commerce business.

Stock looking to find new longs. Lower than I anticipated but looks like 125.5 is the target.

**Edit 23 3:15PM:**

Next support at 125.5. Added to the list.

**Edit 22 3:09PM:**

Regarding gap fills. Gap fills occur when a discontinuity in price is ""filled"".

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8ajjb4i1z0p61.png?width=1210&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a0ef4c638a781bc68e3135031b71b5fb05969bd

I remember a while back there was a DD on a 140 discontinuity if I remember correctly. So we've filled it and it's usually a sign that the price is ready to reverse and climb back up.

**Edit 21 3:07PM:**

I think much of today, we're searching for new lows before a reversal play can happen. It's likely 132.5 is a bounce point, but we are seeing a lack of volume. In fact it's going down.

**From a macro perspective, this sort of mirrors the last time we entered a descending channel, but it's less artificial this time** as some of the swing traders trying to play earnings are genuinely exiting their positions. Again, no immediate red flags for us.

**Edit 19 2:50PM:**

We've completed a gap fill from a couple weeks back around 140. Usually a sign of reversal.

**Edit 18 2:46PM:**

Updated 140 to 141. 141 broken and stock looking to find a new support level. Somewhere between 132.5 and 141.

**Edit 17 2:30PM:**

Tomorrow may be a bit more interesting than today. Still low volume, price may sag to 140 levels.

**Edit 16 2:27PM:**

145-147.5 channel.

**Edit 15 1:53PM:**

I'll pick up a couple more data points throughout the week, and on Monday's stream, I'll cover my thoughts on earnings as well as on new emerging macro trends. The 172 diagonal has evidently been broken and we'll have to chart out a new path for where the stock is headed.

**Edit 14 1:47PM:**

(Or it can bounce if it feels like it). From a macro perspective, we have found a new floor around 141 and we're trading mostly sideways.

**Edit 13 1:44PM:**

Ready to test the 141 support.

**Edit 12 1:23PM:**

Seems like option A from edit 8 is playing out. We may bounce on 145 or test the 141 lows.

**Edit 11 1:18PM:**

iBorrow rate increased today. Will have to see a couple additional data points to confirm an uptrend in fee. The fee should go up really high, even past 80% to signal the start of a squeeze.

**Edit 10 1:16PM:**

**New supports added at 147.5. I forgot to add this earlier.**

**Edit 9 1:03PM:**

**New supports added at 145 and 150.**

**Edit 8 12:48PM:**

**Edit 3 9:36AM:**

Starting from today and including yesterday, I'll have to draw a new support to track our progress. **The 172 diagonal is now expired.** This is not a bad thing, every support eventually gets broken.

**Edit 2 9:33AM:**

You know what's great about SSR? You can easily tell when panic selling is happening by large drops in price and I'm not seeing that at market open. Much higher volume first minute candle (1 million) and people are **buying!**

**Edit 1 9:32AM:**

SSR already triggered for the day. The threshold was 163.58.

Goooooooooooooood morning my fellow apes!

That's right everybody. We now officially have confirmation of the short squeeze potential and it's absolutely nuts. Is the company going bankrupt? No. In fact their e-commerce transition is looking like a success. Let's thank Melvin and friends for the fire sale today!

Nothing in the GameStop conference call was huge and hype specifically about the squeeze. It was a very standard format for such a conference call for a company talking about their increased 4th quarter earnings. Everything people were aching to have them acknowledge to throw the switch on the rocket was left out of this presentation. 

I submit that this was intentional. 

They know how we work. They knew we'd crawl thru that pdf for every possible reference to what's going on. And they didn't even hide it. They literally confirmed every thing we've been saying about the state of the shorts for months. And they put it in the exact place where Reddit would look for it without getting accused if manipulation during the presentation. 

The same thing goes for the thoughts regarding potential splits of the shares. They knew we'd read. And they left it there for us. 

Saying it in the call draws so much more scrutiny and attention. And would deviate from the norm. So instead, they put it in a document already transcribed for us to be able to pour over and analyze, knowing FULL WELL that we'd be digging into their every word. Because that's what we do. 

So in one afternoon, GameStop managed to make an incredibly appealing case for why whales and institutions should buy in on the longevity and fundamentals of the company, while simultaneously sending a clear message to retail that we're right about the DD, the company is aware of us, and they have some tricks up their sleeves to help us out.

I am close to 60 years of age, hold degrees in economics, finance and accounting, so numbers are what they are to me. I have been trading and investing over 20 years on a daily basis and have a pretty solid bank of experience with regard to the stock market, So what happened on Friday March 19?  


A couple of obvious points, early on there was a coordinate effort to drop the stock price toward $13 a share. That failed because of the amount of buying pressure that was put on the dive down in price. By 10 am it was apparent that the stock was not dropping below $13.50 a share and the line was drawn at $14.00 by what appears to have been a massive coordinated effort by several investment firms. As an avid watcher of levels 2 and 3 with regard to the stocks I have an interest in, this is the first and only time I can recall seeing 8-10 market makers all in unison controlling the ask price of a ticker. Like a professional dance company all of them moved in unison on the ask. Up a penny, down a half penny, etc etc and all within milliseconds of each other. This dance continued for hours on end, never allowing the price to run up.  
At close, these market makers all hit the bid with over 40 million shares. My question, where did all those shares come from and where did they go on the bid.  


We will never be able to prove any illegal activity regardless of what happened at the end of the day yesterday. The SEC sure as hell isn't going to look into anything. Remember, it is the hedge funds that are accusing us of manipulating the stock price, which is not true at all because we all love the stock, and I love the company. Been going to the theaters since they used 16mm reels and Dolby systems did not exist.  


OK. So what is the read into everything Well. first and foremost, it was an act of desperation by the hedge funds. They pretty much announced to the world that they know they are screwed on this one and no longer care what tactics they use in their efforts to minimize their upcoming losses. Second, as all of those shares were being sold between 13.90 and 14.02 how many are now in the hands of apes? Of those how many are real shares and how many naked shares will they need to add to the piles of failure to deliver shares, naked shares and the over 187000 call options that expired ITM yesterday? In a nut shell, I think they dug a deeper hole than even they can climb out of.  


Now more than ever here I am determined to keep buying and will not sell 1 share until these hedge funds start to cover all of their misdeeds. It's coming, they are going to delay it as long as possible trying to spread fear of a massive drop in price, trying to get current investors to become impatient and sell. Trying to divide the shareholders into groupings that they will intend to attack separately. They will attack the first group, those who think they will sell at $30 a share, then they will go after the next group of those who think $50 a share is enough and so on. Remember its easier for them to attack smaller groups than the entire group of apes. IT IS KEY THAT WE STICK TOGETHER.  


The price of our stock is up again this week and although we did not end above $14 a share the week was a win for us again. For the past month we have been winning the battles and eventually we will win the war and the price of this stock will soar.  


Patience is needed now more than ever. This will not be the last effort of our common enemy. They will continue to pull every stunt they think they can, and we simply need to not sell any of our shares. For us the battle is getting easier. for them it gets more complex with every stunt they pull and fail at. Make no mistake in reading into this past weeks action, WE WON, THEY LOST. There are hundreds of millions of shares that will need to be purchased to cover short positions which are not just under $14. They still have FTD contracts that go back to when this was under $8. In other words they are still way behind on their obligations. We aren't.  


Going to be another good week ahead if we all hold these shares and those who can, me included, continue to buy and hold more shares. Be smart with what you spend here. But be assured that this company is not a $14 a share company even without the squeeze. With operations back at AMC as a minimum this ticker will trade in the $20 range so the future still shows upward movement even without what we all know is coming in the near future.  


Sorry about being long winded, I just thought it needed to be out that we are still winning this war and we will resume the fight on Monday the 22nd.

“Citadel is throttling buy orders and manipulating the stock downwards

Some new DD was posted recently from r/atobitt and r/tearsaresweat, linked below to their posts:

[525 Million GME shares traded OTC](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcfq4e/shitadel_other_hedgies_are_trading_over_525/)

[Citadel paying for order flow from 9 online brokers](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFuckingValue/comments/mbvplb/huge_citadel_is_paying_for_order_flow_from_nine/)

And I just wanted to link it together for the masses to really ruminate and understand the impact of the Darkpool accumulation of shares (which will likely Fail-to-Deliver ""FTD"" - ie., counterfeit) that Citadel has been doing.

This ELIA was posted by JOELO (I'm directly copy-pasting, because he explained it so digestibly) in the DFV discord.

“So say citadel has 100,000 shares of GME in stock. They pay for order flow from a dozen public traders who route buys and sells of GME through them. If they can fulfill these trades with their personal stock, they do not need to go to public 'lit' markets like the NYSE to get shares. So lets say 5000 people buy 100 GME through them and 5000 people sell 100 GME through them. They can choose to fill the 50000 buys with their 100000 stock and then put the 50000 sells through to the NYSE so the public market only sees the sells and there is only downward pressure on the market""

Except in this case, we're talking about 525 million shares. And they are surely counterfeit/shorted stock, as again, only about 70 million $GME Class A Common Shares are currently in existence, which was re-confirmed in the GME 10-K SEC filing yesterday.

So we're talking about a major market maker who is paying for order flow, accumulating (or fabricating) FTD shares, and then using those fake shares to fulfill the orders of traders on the buy-side, while placing sell-side orders on the NYSE. The buying pressure would not impact the price because it's fulfilled without placing a bid on the market, whereas the selling pressure would make a bigger impact on the market (and thus, the ticker price).

This explains how they've been able to make such a huge impact on the market price, despite having more buying volume than selling volume. It also explains how they've been able to short on the downticks even with SSR protection.

I'm not 100% sure about the SEC definition of Market Manipulation, but this sounds criminal to me. Maybe someone much smarter than I can chip in with what can be done to counteract this bullshit.

Now, I'm not sure what the impact of VIRTU Americas and G1 Execution Services are, but it can be assumed they are in cahoots or complicit in, essentially, naked short selling the stock to manipulate the share price of $GME. Further, these may be partners in crime in order to pass-the-buck on FTD timelines. Ex., when an FTD starts to hit that 13-day mark, it gets passed onto a complicit or cooperating entity.

TL;DR - the price you're seeing is hugely manipulated, and this is the nuts-and-bolts of how they are manipulating it.

Feel free to X-post to r/GME, as they've banned me for some reason without giving me any explanation why.


EDIT 1 - It also explains why the EUROpoor markets have been much better able to sustain upward momentum, stabilize/consolidate the stock, and have more consistent impact on the buy-side - BECAUSE CITADEL ISN'T FRONT-RUNNING THE STOCK'S FULFILLMENT TO IMPACT THE PRICE. They use other (presumably non-compromised) brokers/platforms.”",2021-03-25 09:48:17

290,"Ihor calculates only 1.4m covered, blow this up",1622925925.0,"From another group 

Quick note on the short interest numbers today. Ortex reported a net decrease in borrowed shares of about 29M, which caused some concern that the shorts may be covering more than we thought without seeing the corresponding price action we were expecting. 

However, Ortex tracks borrowed shares that are returned. Not necessarily borrowed shares that were sold short, bought back, and then returned.

Ihor Dusabiwsky with S3 Parnters has his own proprietary tracking system, and they do track actual shorted shares returned. According to their data, there was a net return of 1.4M shorted shares this week (1.6% of the total 88.2M shares currently sold short). 

This means that hedge funds only actually covered 1.4M short shares this week, and decided to return another 27.6M shares that they had borrowed but not yet sold short (likely because they finally realized what a terrible idea it is to short AMC). 

So let’s do some math. Short sellers covered 1.6% of their short position this week, and the share price went up 83%. If you assume the same rate of price increase for each percentage point of short interest covered going forward, then shorts fully covering their position would correspond to a percentage increase of 5,188% over today’s $47.91 closing price. That equals $2,485.60 per share.

And perhaps most importantly, these calculations only account for the covering of LEGAL shorts that are publicly reported to outlets such as Ortex and S3. There are many theories out there on how many illegal/naked/synthetic shares there may be, but the general consensus (backed by some extremely solid DD) is that there are a significant amount, many times more than the number of legal shorts. 

You do the math.

**TLDR APE SUMMARY** 🦍🦍🦍:

* SEC filings are legally binding documents and the information within can be used against companies in court proceedings.
* GME has no obligation to include any information about anything after their fiscal year, January 31, 2021, unless it's a [""subsequent event""](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/cf-manual/topic-13). To my knowledge, unless someone proves me wrong, speculating on a potential squeeze that may or may not happen in the future does NOT fall under this category.
* GME confirmed that as of January 31, 2021, the stock was shorted over 100%
* GME included LEGALLY BINDING information post-January 31, 2021, specifically about its stock, price volatility, and the short squeeze.
* GME is basically saying that they are not responsible for any potential short squeezes that may or may not occur.
* GME IS NOT CONFIRMING that a short squeeze will happen, because no one can predict the future. They are just saying that it's a possibility.
* GME DIDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.
* I'm almost 100% positive that their lawyers advised against including any post-fiscal information, because if I was GME's lawyer that is what I would have advised them in order to limit GME's potential liability, but the fact that it's included anyway, is KIND OF A BIG DEAL.
* Why did they do this? Who knows? But this ape thinks it's to let everyone know what is going on, and to let everyone know that THEY ARE ALSO AWARE of what is going on.
   * UPDATE: I also like u/bigbrainbets's [theory](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mc5jbj/breakdown_of_the_sec_legalese_from_a_fellow/gs342si?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) because it expands on my initial theory of why GME wants us to know that they know what's going on. Apes strong together!
* THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE OR LEGAL ADVICE OR MEDICAL ADVICE. JUST MY OWN APE INTERPRETATION. DO WITH IT WHAT YOU WILL.
* I like the stock and I will HODL.

Good morning my fellow Apes 🦍🦍🦍

I'm seeing a lot of different posts about interpretations and posts about the Gamestop SEC filing and what it means. I'm pretty excited to submit my first DD and contribute to this sub in a meaningful way, because while I'm only a smooth-brained ape when it comes to the stock market, I have a few wrinkles when it comes to SEC Filings.

**What is an SEC Filing?**

Publicly traded companies are required by the law to disclose relevant information concerning their business and corporate structure. The information enables investors to understand the company’s business model and helps them to predict the company’s future performance.

The following are the most common types of SEC filings:

1. SEC Filings Form 10-K (THIS IS THE ONE WE ARE INTERESTED IN TODAY)
2. SEC Filings Form 10-Q
3. SEC Filings Form 8-K
4. SEC Filings Form S-1
5. Form S-4
6. SEC Filings Form 11-K

Form [10-K](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data/public-filings/sec-10-k/) is a report that gives a comprehensive analysis of the company. It includes a detailed summary of the company’s results, [management discussions](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data/public-filings/mda-management-discussion-analysis/), and audited financial statements. Companies are required to submit this filing within 90 days after the end of their fiscal year.

***APE INTERPRETATION*** 🦍🦍🦍:

* ***Companies with stonks need to make their financial info public, so that apes with bananas can decide for themselves if they want to keep or sell their bananas. Financial information includes things like profit, loss, any potential lawsuits, and risks to the company.***
* ***Companies file 10-k reports at the end of each financial year. These reports describe the activities of the last financial year,*** ***NOT ACTIVITIES UP TO AND INCLUDING THE DAY OF FILING (THIS IS IMPORTANT)***
* ***These reports are professionally audited and reviewed/filed by lawyers, because any incorrect or misleading information can lead to huge lawsuits.***
* ***INFORMATION IN AN SEC FILING IS THE MOST ACCURATE SOURCE OF INFORMATION YOU CAN FIND ON ANY COMPANY (unless that company is lying, which would be financial/business suicide).***

* ***COMPANIES ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO REPORT ON ANYTHING AFTER THEIR YEAR END***
* ***THE FACT THAT GAMESTOP TALKS ABOUT EVENTS AND SITUATIONS AFTER THEIR YEAR END, UP TO THE DATE OF FILING, IS KIND OF A PRETTY BIG DEAL BECAUSE EVERYTHING THEY FILE WITH THE SEC HAS TO BE ACCURATE AND IT'S A BINDING LEGAL DOCUMENT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED AGAINST THEM IN COURT.***

**GAMESTOP SEC FILING: RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK**

The market price of our common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely, due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include, without limitation:

***(APE INTERPRETATION*** 🦍🦍🦍: ***the factors in this list are NOT EXHAUSTIVE. the ""without limitation"" DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE VALUE OF THE SQUEEZE IS WITHOUT LIMITATION. They even put a COLON after the words ""without limitation"" which in grammatical terms, indicates the beginning of a list, and therefore it's A FULL STOP, like a period.)***

* “short squeezes”;

(***APE INTERPRETATION*** ***🦍🦍🦍: NOTICE HOW SHORT SQUEEZE IS IN QUOTATIONS? That means they are using a specific definition for it, and their interpretation of what a short squeeze means should be in the document itself. the interpretation is further below)***

* comments by securities analysts or other third parties, including blogs, articles, **message boards and social and other media**;

(***APE INTERPRETATION*** ***🦍🦍🦍: SHOUTOUT TO*** r/GME ***AND APES!!)***

* large stockholders exiting their position in our Class A Common Stock or an increase or decrease in the short interest in our Class A Common Stock;
* actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial and operating results;
* risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;
* the timing and allocations of new product releases including new console launches;
* the timing of new store openings or closings;
* shifts in the timing or content of certain promotions or service offerings;
* the effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate;
* acquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in;
* the mix of earnings in the countries in which we operate;
* the costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets, businesses or stores;
* changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
* negative public perception of us, our competitors, or industry; and
* overall general market fluctuations

For example, on January 28, 2021, our Class A Common Stock experienced an intra-day trading high of $483.00 per share and a low of $112.25 per share. In addition, from January 11, 2021 to March 17, 2021, the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19.94 to as high as $347.51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7,060,000 to 197,200,000 shares. **During this time, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume.**

(***APE INTERPRETATION*** ***🦍🦍🦍: THEY ARE BASICALLY SIGNALLING TO US THAT THE PRICE VOLATILITY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE COMPANY ITSELF, THE COMPANY HAS REMAINED THE SAME, AND THIS IS BEING CAUSED BY OUTSIDE INFLUENCE - THEY HAD NO REASON TO DO THIS. THEY HAD NO REASON TO INCLUDE INFORMATION FROM JUST A FEW DAYS AGO IN THIS FILING, BUT THEY DID...)***

These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.

**GAMESTOP SEC FILINGS FORM 10-K: A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.**

Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing.

This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”

(***APE INTERPRETATION*** ***🦍🦍🦍: THE LAST TWO SENTENCES IN THAT PARAGRAPH IS THEIR INTERPRETATION OF A SHORT SQUEEZE - notice the words ""MAY"", which means it CAN happen but it's not GUARANTEED, as opposed to using, for example, ""SHALL"" or ""MUST"")***

Listen fellow apes, relax! The Mother Of All Short Squeezes will happen! I’ll show you that even with conservative numbers, we’re in for a hell of a ride! 🚀🚀🚀 

If you have the slightest doubt in the MOASS, you seriously need to keep on reading!

(Too ape to read? TLDR at bottom.)


## 🚀 Short interest in GME

The official number as of 14 March is 10.19M shares of the GME stock sold short (*cough* BS! *cough*), but even [a really conservative estimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lzj00a/super_conservative_calculation_puts_gme_short/) puts the short interest at 38M, and that is a *very* conservative estimate. (I will argue later that this is actually *far too* conservative.) This may look like a puny number compared to the more speculative numbers that have been thrown around lately, but you have to understand that even this number is HUGE! This is more than 50% of the shares outstanding! To put this in context, 20% of the *float* [is considered **extremely high**](https://www.powercycletrading.com/what-is-a-high-short-interest-ratio/)! According to [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME), the float of GME is about 45.3M, and with 38M sold short, the short interest is 84% of the float! Let me repeat, 20% is extremely high, which means that 84% is **beyond extreme!** (I see different numbers for the float on different sites, it depends on how you define it, and I’m not sure what the best estimate is, but even if the float was 70M (100% of shares outstanding), a SI of 38M would be *extreme*!) 


## 🚀 The shorts must be covered

If you look up shareholders for GME on any financial site, you will quickly notice that more than 70M shares (the actual number of shares in existence) is owned by institutions alone, e.g. [yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME) says 110.64%, or 77.4M shares. But how is that even possible when there’s only 70M shares issued? [Wall street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-called-attention-to-the-share-lending-market-heres-what-you-should-know-11617375748) put it this way:

> Though that seems impossible, a perfectly benign explanation exists. Imagine that Jack borrows 100 shares of GameStop from mutual fund No. 1 with the intention to short them. When those shares are shorted, they get bought by fund No. 2. Now, Jane wants to short-sell GameStop, too. She borrows those same 100 shares from fund No. 2, and when she shorts them they are bought by fund No. 3. In theory, this process could go on indefinitely, Mr. Hillerberg says. ""There is no theoretical upper limit on the ratio of a company's shares sold short to its free float.""
>
> This illustration assumes the same 100-share block of GameStop is borrowed, shorted, bought and lent out again. In fact, there is no way of knowing whether a particular 100-share block of GameStop stock bought or sold today is the same as what was transacted yesterday. That's because, once lent, those shares are part of the ""fungible pool"" of GameStop stock, according to Roy Zimmerhansl, principal at Pierpoint Financial Consulting and former head of global securities lending at HSBC.

As this says, and as I tried to explain in [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhjfee/mythbuster_dd_can_you_set_the_price_for_your/), for every share sold short, a new share is actually added to the pool of shares. This means that if 38M shares are sold short, there are 70M + 38M = 108M shares being owned by someone, but only 70M of those are actual shares that e.g. can be used to vote at the annual shareholders meeting. When the short sellers are forced to cover, they have to buy back every single share that has been sold short, bringing the total back to 70M shares.


## 🚀 Availability of shares to cover

*“So you’re saying there are 108M shares on the market, and they only have to buy back 38M of them?”*

First of all, even if those numbers were correct, it would be a *huge* potential for a squeeze. But there’s a major difference in how available those 108M shares actually are.

Let’s break down the ownership of GME:
* **A large portion is held by insiders** (24.6M according to yahoo, I guess this includes Ryan Cohen). These are usually not considered to be “available on the market”, and are subtracted from the shares outstanding to give us the *float* of 45.3M. *(Unless there are some restrictions I’m not aware of, even insiders may in theory choose to sell off their positions if the price is right, but they must report it. Correct me if I’m wrong.)*
* **A large portion is held by Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)** (16.51%, or 11.5M according to [ETF Channel](https://www.etfchannel.com/symbol/gme/). They have fixed intervals and dates when they rebalance their funds, and won’t sell off their positions in GME just because it squeezes. *(But the ones holding ETFs may sell their ETF shares at any time.)*
* **Some shares are held for hedging purposes by market makers**, they will only be sold if their hedging needs change. (Not sure how much this constitutes to, please provide numbers/sources if you know more.)
* **A *very* large amount is held by institutions**, most sources say at least 75M (77.4M on Yahoo finance). Institutions are usually in it for the long run, and are known to hold on to their positions through peaks and valleys, and will not liquidate their positions at the first sign of a squeeze. *(It is hard to establish exactly how much is held by institutions, because how often they must report their holdings is very limited. Anyone with at least $100M in assets under management must report their holdings quarterly, but may report with up to 45 days delay. But anyone must report no later than 10 days after month’s end if they acquire at least 5% ownership, and must then report within 2 business days if their ownership percentage changes with more than 1 percentage point. This means the numbers for major institutions are fairly accurate, but there can be a lot of smaller whales that go under the radar. E.g. [Marketbeat](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/institutional-ownership/) says institutional ownership has increased in 2021, so I’m pretty sure 75 is not a high estimate.)*
* A large amount is held by funds, but they report differently, and their positions may be included in the reports from institutions, so I’m not sure this belongs in this list. (Again, correct me if I’m wrong, or if you have some juicy facts or numbers.)
* **A huge amount is lent out.** If someone sells shares that have been lent out, those shares must be recalled and bought back by the short sellers who borrowed them. And since many shares may have been lent out multiple times, this may even cause a chain where the shares must be bought back many times. This is one reason this may accelerate very quickly, once short sellers start to cover.

Note that the shares held by insiders, ETFs and institutions *alone* add up to over 111 million, which means that at least 111M - 70M = 41M shares must have been sold short based on these numbers alone, and that the conservative estimate of 38M is in fact *too* conservative.

All these factors make the number of shares that are “easily available” on the market to cover the shorts *far less* than 108M, and sets us up perfectly for a MAJOR squeeze. (Still, there is no fixed number of shares that simply *cannot* be bought. Eventually, if the price is high enough, “any” shareholder may be convinced to sell. In the end, it always comes down to a price. And in *theory*, all those 108M shares could be sold, AFAIK.)


## 🚀 AND THEN THERE ARE THE DIAMOND HANDED APES!!! 🦍🦍🦍💎🤲🏼

This is the critical factor, the factor that makes this the MOASS, and not just *a* SS. Apes are a completely different breed. They don’t fall for their FUD campaigns in MSM, they behave completely irrationally, and will hold until they see the moon in the rear view mirror, just for the fun of kicking hedgies in their nuts. Their FUD campaigns have included efforts to make us believe apes are insignificant in all of this, but [we are not](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m520iq/regarding_retail_has_no_power_numbers_data_a/)! 

Nobody knows exactly how strong retail is. [One fellow ape](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m54vpq/serious_dd_retail_ownership_using_public_data/) argues that retail investors who have invested in GME have invested $2000 on average, and estimates total retail ownership of GME to 40M shares. To me, this estimate seems very conservative, and it is partly based on Swedish and UK numbers, estimating that 1.6-3.3% of retail investors own GME. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m520iq/regarding_retail_has_no_power_numbers_data_a/) estimates that there are at least 110M American users on various trading platforms, and says 50% of RH (🤮) users held GME in January. I recently saw eToro say 9.1% of their users held GME, and I remember someone saying 7%+ on another major platform. (Please provide more numbers and sources if you know any!) Let’s be conservative and say 5% of those 110M trading accounts hold GME, and have 10 shares each on average. That is 55M shares! (The number of shares held per retail investor is the biggest uncertainty in this post. 10 shares @200 = $2000. People who bought in early, or during the $40 sale in February, would have gotten significantly more for $2000. And $2000 is also just a guesstimate. Many own more, and many own less. Though I can’t be absolutely certain, I don’t think 10 on average is too optimistic. And this is not including Canada, Europe, or the rest of the world! I honestly believe 55M is a *conservative* estimate.)


## 🚀 Contribution to the short interest from Retail ownership

So far, we have estimated the short interest to be a minimum of 41M shares based solely on insider and institutional ownership and ETFs holding GME. This number does not include shares sold short to retail, but I don’t think we can use a 1-to-1 relationship here. I believe some brokers hold shares on behalf of their users and include such holdings in their filings, so this will be included in the amount reported to be held by institutions. But I also know some trading platforms actually buy the shares in the user’s name, and those will not be included when they file their holdings to the SEC. So I’m sure retail ownership adds several million shares to the short interest, making even the 41M estimate *far* too conservative. (Please enlighten me if you know more about how this works.)


## 🚀 The real tipping point

I believe the main factor in this saga isn’t whether the short interest is this or that, we know it’s huge, and in the end it doesn’t really matter exactly *how* huge it is. I’ve seen people saying *all shares* must be bought back because the short interest is above 100%, but that’s not how it works. The fact is that *all shares sold short* must be bought back. There are just shy of 70M actual shares. If 38M shares are sold short, then 38M out of 38M+70M=108M shares must be bought back, so that there are 70M shares left. If 400M are sold short, then 400M out of 470M must be bought back. It’s never 100%, there are always 70M actual shares that don’t need to be bought back. The major concern is whether or not diamond handed apes ***control the float.***

**Case A:**  
If more than 70M shares (the shares outstanding) are held by diamond hands, there is not even a theoretical way for short sellers to cover their positions without buying from apes, and we can truly just name our price (collectively), and they have no choice but to give in to our demand (without government intervention, at least). If we own 55M (like my conservative estimate), we must rely on insiders to hold strong. I seriously can’t imagine Ryan Cohen (with his 9M shares) would paper hand his position, I suspect he is more diamond handed than most of us, and would *love* to see the hedgies bleed. I don’t know about the rest of the insiders, but I can’t see what motivation they would have to bail out the short sellers. (As mentioned, we also have ETFs, and market makers’ hedging “on our side”, but I’m too smooth brained to understand how big role these will play.)

**Case B:**  
If we own less than the shares outstanding, even together with insiders and other positions that are somehow “locked up” (I highly doubt this is the case), we must rely on the long whales to hold. In this case, we’re still in for a MASSIVE squeeze, but it’s also more likely that the whales may try to limit the squeeze, like Porsche did in [the Volkswagen squeeze](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgya1f/minidd_the_volkswagen_squeeze_tldr_and_key_lessons/) back in 2008. After all, if this rocket goes to Andromeda, they may be forced to chip in on the bill through DTCC (if I have understood that correctly), or they may at least experience severe losses in their other holdings as hedge funds are getting liquidated and other stocks plummet, or if the entire market crashes, as some DD have suggested it might. On the other hand, many whales may have the most to gain from a proper squeeze, and may want to join us on the ride no matter where it takes us. If a whale has invested only 1% of their portfolio in GME, it will exceed the value of the rest of their portfolio already at $20k.

The conservative estimates presented in this post puts us close to the “tipping point” between case A and case B. If case A is true, this will truly be the MOASS, and I can almost guarantee that changes in laws and regulations will follow to make sure something like this never happens again. (We’ve already seen all the DTCC rule changes.) Case B is less fun, obviously. We’d have to rely on others, and they might have more complex motives than to just f*ck the hedgies while getting rich. But the more of the shares we control, the more power we have, and the more we diamond hand, the farther the rocket will go. That’s why I call the MOASS a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we don’t believe in it, we will hold back our investments, and paper hand at the first sign of turbulence, and the rocket fuel may run out halfway to the moon. But if we believe in it, we will buy more and control more, and our hands 🤲🏼 will be made into true diamonds. 💎💎 And this will make the squeeze legendary! So I urge you to just **BELIEVE IN IT!**


## 🚀 Still have doubts?

Seriously? 🙄

Well, if you still need more reason to believe that we are *THE* important factor, just ask yourself: If we aren’t, then:
* Why would they run such massive FUD campaigns in MSM?
* Why would they infiltrate our subs?
* Why would they try to get our DD makers banned, and even send them [death threats](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mctnn7/the_psychological_warfare_is_in_the_end_phase_and/)?
* **Why would they try so hard to make us fold if our hodling didn’t matter?**

It’s not hard to see that ***they* are afraid of *us***!

If you fear all the hedgies have covered their shorts, just remember:
* Even the official number of 10.19M is very high, and does not include ETFs containing GME that have been shorted.
* Virtually no GME shares are left to be borrowed, which means *a lot* have already been borrowed and sold short.
* Using publicly available ownership numbers, we can *conservatively* estimate the short interest to be at least 41M shares, not even counting for the contribution from retail ownership, which must be *several* million shares.
* Excellent DDs have revealed major trickery with [naked shorting and resetting FTDs](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/) using options and conversions, as well as shorting GME through ETFs.
* The stock price of GME is obviously heavily manipulated, like that 50%(!) drop we saw on 3/10 (that curiously was reported by MarketWatch *before* it even happened!) This is not natural behavior for a stock, but obviously planned scare tactics to shake off paper hands. Why would they want to scare us, if they had nothing to lose?


## 🚀 Worst case scenario 

If you’re still scared, let’s look at what you have to lose.

Even if I’m completely wrong, if the shorts have pretty much covered, if retail holds an insignificant portion of the float, if most apes will paper hand, and there’ll never be a squeeze, even then, we have not lost! Then we are simply left with a regular stock, and must do a conventional value analysis. Remember that Keith Gill (aka u/DeepFuckingValue, aka Roaring Kitty) is a *value* investor! He’s invested in this stock because he sincerely believes in it. I bet no single person has spent more time analyzing the true value of GME, and he didn’t sell at 480, and [he is still hodling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mi9hdf/gme_yolo_update_apr_1_2021/)! He sees enormous potential in this company, and I for one am also convinced that Ryan Cohen can turn GME into a successful e-commerce company that delights gamers. Even some traditional analysts are realizing the potential for GameStop, and [have increased their one year price target to $175](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-new-price-target-jefferies-reddit-traders-celebrating-2021-3-1030242026). 

I sincerely believe the worst case scenario is that we will see GME grow into a highly valued stock, as Ryan Cohen turns the whole business around.


# 🚀🚀🚀 TLDR / Summary 🚀🚀🚀

Conservative estimates imply **the short interest of GME is beyond extreme**. Even the official short interest (10.19M shares, or 14.6% of shares outstanding, which I believe is complete BS) puts it in the category ‘very high’.

No matter if the short interest is extremely high, or just very high, we are still in for a massive squeeze, because all shorts must eventually cover, and this stock is only going up.

The main factor in this saga is NOT the magnitude of the short interest, but how much of the stock that is held by diamond hands. Every share we hold is a share they cannot use to cover. 

If retail controls the entire float (and relatively conservative estimates say we do), **we can literally just name our price** (collectively) once this rocket launches. 

If we don’t control the float alone, we are still in for a massive squeeze, but must rely more on long whales to hold with us. In this case, **how far into space we’ll go depends on *how much* we hold, and *how diamond handed* we are.** That’s why I say it’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we believe in it, and continue to buy and hodl, **the MOASS is simply inevitable!**

We have everything to gain, and literally nothing to fear. Holding doesn’t cost us anything, and the worst case scenario is that we have invested in an excellent stock. Our own value investor DFV did not sell at 480, and even conventional analysts have set the one year price target to $175. I believe Ryan Cohen and the team he is assembling will take GME to new heights, even without a squeeze.

# TADR: Buy and HODL! 💎🤲🏼🦍🚀🌙

Edit:

**Exit strategy**

As I mentioned, when all shorts have covered, there will still be 70M shares left that have not been bought. (The original 70M shares outstanding.) Does that mean there will be 70M shares held by bag holding apes? When the squeeze is over, I think much of the 70M will still be held by insiders, ETFs, funds, and large institutions. However, quite a few shares will most likely be held by apes as well, but keep in mind that **the infinite squeeze will last as long as apes continue to hold the float!** If apes own the entire float, plus at least one share per ape, apes may in fact maintain the infinite squeeze until all apes have sold at least one share at their desired price!

I won’t disclose my exact position, but I’ll just say I own more than 10 shares. As long as there’s an infinite squeeze, I can sell *one* of my shares at pretty much any price I want, so there’s no reason for me to sell more than one. If I get to sell the one share at my personal price target, I will gladly hold my remaining shares to the very end, and do my part to maintain the squeeze and bleed the hedgies dry, as well as letting my fellow apes cash in.

This only works if most apes sell *really slowly*! If lots of apes start to sell off their entire positions, or start to panic sell, apes will quickly own less than the float, and the infinite squeeze will be over. The longer apes hold, the harder this will squeeze.

**I believe it’s in the best interest of all apes out there to sell as slowly as possible!** Spread the word!

&#x200B;

I. **The DTCC just published a ""new"" SEC Regulatory Rule Filing**

[https:\/\/www.dtcc.com\/legal\/sec-rule-filings](https://preview.redd.it/ww85de4x6nn61.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=752d216af1904a9a4f389249a1aa063d3af1fb1b)

&#x200B;

II. The Subject of the filing is to (IN SHORT) ""**Remove the Requirement for Participants to Submit Monthly Position Confirmations and Clarify Participant Obligation to Reconcile Activity on a Regular Basis**""

https://preview.redd.it/61p47v167nn61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=b353b240ab59d849834e6d3ef2b2ccab698bd010

&#x200B;

III. This rule change has been on the table for some time and took effect today, because it was filed today. Thus I said it's ""new"".

https://preview.redd.it/tzzudzan7nn61.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d1b8c522ec21388089e76c04fe0f01889eea67

https://preview.redd.it/l1hyr2s7mnn61.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=77b51cd06a1018eb72057f019e96552ccd36c4bb

&#x200B;

IV. **What effect does this rule have?** Especially in the current situation. In plain English: Hedgies had to report their positions on a monthly basis to the DTCC prior to the rule change.

In addition to that (by u/bull_moose_man)  there was a contradictory rule that stated daily reports had to be submitted; as Hedgies were able to cite this contradiction as a reason to ignore the rules, now that it’s gone they have no choice but to comply. That means submitting daily reports and opening up their accounts to the Govt if the balance “threatens” other NCSS members.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

V. **So what happens now?** Well, now that there is no rule stating when they have to report/confirm (previously once a month!), the DTCC can now ask them at any given time to report/confirm their positions. They are tying the rope around the snakes neck to keep them under control. This is nothing major, but wait for point VI. It already shows, DTCC is actually trying to stop these out of control Hedgefunds, because they are endangering other Institutions with their behaviour at the moment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

VI. **Why this rule change is bigger than you think:** This rule in addition to the (yet to be passed) SR-NSCC-2021-801, stating that the DTCC can liquidate their members positions at any time, just shows, the DTCC wants to keep everything under their control. So if they see Citadel doing illegal shit (remember, they can ask for a report on a daily basis  now) and their new rule comes into effect, they would notice and could force Citadel to liquidate on close their positions. **This is the most important thing about this rule!**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: New rule is in effect now. What does it do? Hedgies had to report their positions on a monthly basis to the DTCC. The subject of this rule change is ""**Remove the Requirement for Participants to Submit Monthly Position Confirmations and Clarify Participant Obligation to Reconcile Activity on a Regular Basis**""

How is that any good?  Well, now that there is no rule stating when they have to report/confirm (previously once a month!), the DTCC can now ask them at any given time to report/confirm their positions. They are tying the rope around the snakes neck to keep them under control. This is nothing major, but wait for point VI. It already shows, DTCC is actually trying to stop these out of control Hedgefunds, because they are endangering other Institutions with their behaviour at the moment. (Also read point VI. Quote: ""This rule in addition to the (yet to be passed) SR-NSCC-2021-801, stating that the DTCC can liquidate their members positions at any time, just shows, the DTCC wants to keep everything under their control. So if they see Citadel doing illegal shit (remember, they can ask for a report on a daily basis  now) and their new rule comes into effect, they would notice and could force Citadel to liquidate on close their positions.

***So to start, and this should be fairly brief, here's the original post link about the iBorrowDesk report and of course far more info as well:***

***Link to iBorrowDesk for GME:***

***Before you read or after, doesn't matter, just look at the fee graph and i think we can see the waves shrinking in terms of short fees because the amount of money needing to keep it at those levels is fucking significant. The waves are only going to get smaller.  They put too much into the first wave to save themselves from the outcome.***

You've seen the iBorrowDesk image, now look at my hand written DD that i graphed on another separate post (not now, come back to it):[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7glq3/so\_ive\_spent\_over\_an\_hour\_doing\_this\_and\_i\_hope/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7glq3/so_ive_spent_over_an_hour_doing_this_and_i_hope/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Edit: You can also just skip that and go straight the graph I made with those percents compared to GME daily close for ALL YTD days:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m861o4/so\_last\_night\_i\_posted\_my\_calculation\_of\_daily/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m861o4/so_last_night_i_posted_my_calculation_of_daily/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

As I was staring at the fee line graph and looking at the amazing fee at some points in time, the dates really started standing out.  Exactly on March 24th, 2020, the short interest borrow fee was at 101%.  Why does this date stand out to me?  1 single reason, the short positions were IMO set up over a year in advance and this year on ***March 24th?  That's the day after the GME earnings report this year***..Notably after this in March, the graph spikes in April and May far higher than March 24th.  ***Speculation:  We can look to the past in the borrow fee to this year and watch the bleeding live.  No date predictions on a squeeze(WHICH I CANT WAIT TO FUCKING SEE GENTS AND LADIES!!), I just think this week is going to be exciting and I like the Stonk!***

Edit: I forgot to add that March 9th was the 2020 earnings for GME

**The Short Interest Fee Graph looks like a reverse Elliot Wave**

&#x200B;

***My Probability calculator from Fidelity on Active Trader Pro has consistently been aiming GME well into the 5 figures on share price in May, and I've been racking my brain trying to figure out how this is being automatically generated and why.***

Why when GME price goes up and down, no matter what, the ***future price top end*** keeps staying in the 5 figures.  when GME hit $350 the calculator already had GME over $22,000 a share the day before...this has to be the ABSOLUTE BARE MINIMUM.  Why?  Because that number has to be calculating if every share that needed to be covered was bought all consecutively..idk though, your guess is as good as mine on that.  I hope somebody else can shine a brighter light on this for us Apes!

***Now here is what I referred to as being speculative.***

I know that Melvin Capital had listed 6,000,000 in Puts on GME as of their Feb 16th SEC filing on their holdings.  Where's the speculation at you ask?  So as I look at the options table on Yahoo Finance, for weeks mind you, I notice there are all kinds of PUT OPTIONS well below any price a reasonable person would be betting on.  Even if you got paid to place the puts on $GME being under $5 when would you have done that...last year?  It certainly wouldn't have been anytime recently.   Once I saw a Put Option in Feb or March and the Strike was at like $2-3 and it said 60,000 open interest, it ***(Melvins Short position hidden in plain sight as a worthless Put option)*** clicked to me.  The hedges who have shorted GME to the Marianas Trench are so greedy, they mirrored their short positions with puts around the same prices.  We might not have to guess what the short positions are, we can look at the Put Options.  Speculation at best, but the numbers lining up so well and being so massive, nobody in their right mind would have ever thrown so much money away like that.

Edit 2: I have a pinned post on my profile that is a screenshot of these 6,000,000 in puts on GME from Melvin:

Edit 3:  If you've made it this far reading, I suggest you watch the entire Superbowl Halftime show by MJ.  DFV tweeted the image of him Holding where he stood still for 3 minutes.  the whole video is a message to me and its great.  If you can sit there and watch MJ hold for 3 minutes while everyone continues to cheer..then you're an ape and thats the exact feeling we all have, nonetheless in this halftime show, it was a point to show we're all in this together no matter what our differences are [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBkNQZ-6QHg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBkNQZ-6QHg)

&#x200B;

Let me tell y'all a little secret.  Melvin and Friends have to pay people to run fear campaigns and smears against GME, Reddit etc.  Imagine the money they have to put into this.  Now compare to the hedgefunds on our side of the coin..do they need to pay for campaigns to drive the price up?  Of course not. Why?  Because look at all the happy investors who love nothing more than to advertise for free!  We outnumber them in terms of man power.  We win by keeping this relevant across the internet!!!  ***Think Pop---Eyes and their chicken----sandwich!!***

Tl;dr In short, I like the stock, I bought at $44.50 after DFV made his legendary statement and double down of 50,000 shares.$GME go brrrrrrrrrrrrr

FYI I have a support line at $188 or so, stay calm 💎💎🍗🍗🚀🚀

These lines made me fixated on the artificial volume My Support Lines here are based on where I think Artificial Volume caused the price to drop down from $508 to $160 or so, check the date on the post and look at the 10 day chart:

# Hedge Funds covering up $GME shorts through ETF cloaking

*I would like to present a few common terminologies before starting this post which may aid in helping you apes comprehend this more clearly.*

**Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)-**  An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a type of security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or another asset, but which can be purchased or sold on a stock exchange the same as a regular stock. An ETF can be structured to track anything from the price of an individual commodity to a large and diverse collection of securities. ETFs can even be structured to track specific investment strategies. You can consider them as a hybrid of mutual funds.

**Short Selling-**  Short selling is the process of selling shares that you don't own, but have instead borrowed, likely from a brokerage. Most people short sell shares for two reasons:

1. They expect the share price to decline. Short-sellers hope to sell shares at a high price today and use the proceeds to buy back the borrowed shares at a lower price sometime in the future in a bid to profit.
2. They want to hedge or offset a position held in another security. For example, if you have sold a [put option](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp), an offsetting position would be to short sell the underlying security.

**Authorized Participants -** An authorized participant is an organization that has the right to create and redeem shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). They provide a large portion of the liquidity in the ETF market by obtaining the underlying assets required to create the shares of an ETF. When there is a shortage of ETF shares in the market, authorized participants create more. Likewise, as ETF borrow costs increase, APs are less likely to borrow shares to hedge their position, and more likely to fail-to-deliver. 

In a typical transaction, the borrower of a stock posts collateral of 102% to 105% of the shares' value in cash, government securities or a bank letter of credit. If the ETF needs to sell the stock, it can recall it from the borrower. But if the borrower for any reason isn't able to deliver the shares, the ETF is repaid through the collateral instead, although that can have adverse tax consequences for the ETF. 

 **$GME relationship: Let's look at the past trend of an ETF with GME**

Now I'm not claiming today's red day was entirely due to etf's being shorted or their shares being lent out, but there is significant evidence that leads me to believe this may be one of the key factors.

&#x200B;

[Notice how the assets in XRT plummet suddenly after the first short squeeze? ](https://preview.redd.it/17et6f62ran61.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fcb89c0022cbfab1688cf686fd4469a5a6c3e4a)

 *By law, a fund can have no more than one-third of its total assets in securities on loan. Few ETFs or other funds ever reach that ceiling, and ETFs are considered to be more conservative lenders than other funds. Market makers are continually creating new ETF shares (by presenting the fund with a basket of securities represented in the ETF) and redeeming others (and getting the underlying securities in return), so the number of ETF shares outstanding fluctuates. Because the supply isn't fixed, there really is no impact on performance when an ETF is net short, industry participants say. The prices of ETF shares typically stay very close to the value of the underlying holdings.*

***ETF shares borrowed today saw significant lending. Suspicious, isn't it?***

Just taking into account **Three** ETF lendings, **you could see 3.35 Million shares were borrowed in today's trading session.**

Short Sellers effectively manipulate pricing by borrowing shares in a company in order to sell them with downward pressure, coupling it with High-Frequency Machines being used, the price of a security can significantly drop in a rapid succession as we've been witnessing for the past few trading days.

**The HF's have most likely synthetically shorted GME via ETF's to drive its price down since then**. They can also legally disguise their short position via synthetic longs, and there's concrete evidence that they have done this on the various articles posted before.  

**When coupled with synthetic longs via options, gives the appearance of shorts covering when they haven't, takes GME off the threshold security list when it shouldn't be**, and provides the ability to naked short GME again. This was the missing piece of how GME could actually be shorted without appearing so. This solves the NYSE threshold securities issue and the ability to drive GME down outside of buying a put.

**Ultimately they have to cover these shorts sometime or another, if the ETF's recall their shares back that would mean an absolute fuckery of melvin and citadel, given they are still paying massive SI without the numbers actually showing up the threshold index**.

# The Link Between Failure to Delivers (FTD) and ETF's

ETF's are a growing force in financial markets and constitute almost 25% of US equity trading volume, therefore please keep in mind that not all shares shorted with specific ETF's are directly linked to GME. The one's I used as evidence is either because $GME is a major part of their portfolio or the ETF is retail orientated. 

**Failure To Deliver (FTD)-** A condition where two investors agree to the purchase/sale of a security at a given price but the seller fails to deliver the security in a timely manner.

Comparing both charts depict how the recent increase in FTD has had a direct correlation with ETF volume being shorted. Point being? The finance industry has used ETF's as a way of covering up their FTD's way before  $GME. **Bunch of snakes**

 **Authorized Participant Arbitrage Option: Operational Shorting** 

When faced with ""excessive buying"" pressure as we have witnessed with $GME,  Authorized Participants and Market may sell shares as ""Naked"" and then locate or create the shares at a later time (up to T+6 for bona fide market making). However, delaying past T+3 results in an FTD **but AP/Market Makers are allowed to fail past T+3 because they are ""making markets"" and have an additional three days to settle trades (a total of T+6). This choice of shorting can also lock in a profit if options are used to hedge their exposure but with less capital outlay.** I won't go too in-depth about options hedging in this post because I want to keep the topic on the point of ETF's. However, I see a lot of misconception regarding calls and delta hedging which leads to misinformation being spread. 

**TLDR**

**Do NOT WORRY about the price decreasing, this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that**. **Over 3.5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day. It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card. Does it solve the issue? No. It only delays it and makes it worse. Secondly, there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD. People who cheer for GME being put on the SSR need to realise that has no significant impact as hedge funds have other ways or artificially decreasing the price.**

**Can't stop, won't stop. Gamestop.🙌💎**

We can't have that!",2021-04-17 12:33:21,304,Sideways trading until a catalyst/liftoff is what we want and here's why!,1617078010.0,"Someone asked me why staying delta neutral is better than just good ol fashioned stock value going up, to that i say: in a normal world (market) stock value just going up makes sense - but in this shady, loophole filled, corrupted, opaque, bought and paid for ""free market"" with the government body charged with looking over it apparently a revolving door for people having been in or heading for the financial industry and so partners in crime, that have been turning a major blind eye for a long time now which allowed this whole situation to happen in the first place - well normal rules don't apply.

The rules here are the short Hedgefunds get to dictate what happens to the price, they allow it to naturally rise a certain amount, then make money off their call options and then tank the price - via extra naked shorting, ETF shorting and ***wash trading:***

[***https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcn6gc/this\_isnt\_the\_first\_time\_citadel\_has\_been\_caught/***](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcn6gc/this_isnt_the_first_time_citadel_has_been_caught/)

Then when the price is tanked they make money off their put options, then allow the price to naturally rise again to a certain point, make money off their call options then tank it again, make money off their put options then let it rise again....... This is market manipulation to force profits off their ***~~delta~~*** ***hedging*** to try to generate some extra liquidity to help stall things out.

People talk about needing a catalyst for liftoff and they talk about Ryan Cohens options such as a Stock Split, Dividend Payout, Share Recall, Stockholder Meeting etc but here's one that doesn't get mentioned:

There is an ancient Ape saying ""We can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent""

What's one thing better than just outlasting them and their solvency? Helping to reduce that solvency. how? By inflicting the aptly named ***max pain theory*** to counter their ***~~delta~~*** ***hedging*** \- There's a reason we finished at just above 180 multiple times now and there's graphs showing our specific max pain point on GME currently and it's right around 175 - 185 (if anyone has that graph to contribute, or an updated/current one to add.)

Edit:  [https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/GME](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/GME)

(Look where the put and call options meet, where it basically makes the rest of the majority of calls and puts expire worthless.)

And we must be doing something right - because Citadel was already forced to make shitty rated BBB- bonds for 600m liquidation! so it turns out we really can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent especially when we drain them of that solvency! Get outplayed Kenny G!

So i know it's not the most exciting and perhaps even just a little bit worrying to some, but just know ***we are sideways trading by design***, that ***it's actually what we want***, that what ""we're"" (the long institutions are) doing is ***helping to make Shorts bleed even more and force liftoff sooner than otherwise.***

Edit: Oh look, we traded completely sideways in After Hours market too. Know though, that strategies change as there's new developments every day, as well as reactions to previous strategies from both sides, not to mention that by now the Hedgies read all our top stuff and so know what we know, but we know they know what we know, even if they know we know they know what we know, you know? (teehee) So don't feel bad if things change (Again) as this thing is statistically inevitable, even declared by Gamestop themselves of there being over 100% short as well as a ***very rare*** short squeeze warning in their 10K - So it's just a matter of when, while enjoying the ride along the way - regardless of where that ride takes us along the way.

TL:DR sideways trading inflicts the ***max pain theory*** on short Hedgefunds, countering their ***~~delta~~*** ***hedging*** by keeping them ***~~delta~~*** ***neutral*** to make them bleed out even quicker, unable to profit off GME volatility via options both up and down, each swing.",2021-03-29 21:20:10

# GME is up 441% since 2/24

So because I've been seeing a lot of shill posts yesterday and have not used the delete button this hard since mom found my ""Homework"" folder.

Lets look at some basic facts.

Did the dip change anything? are we still on?

Guys nothing changed, we had a dip we have had red days since the 27/18th of January and we had it for weeks. One dip doesn't change anything in my book.

look at the 24th of feb, this is less than 2 weeks ago and we went from 40 to 250, this is still up A LOT!

So guys chill the fuck out, I get it, this is exciting and scary at the same time but we are still going up, but don't expect stocks to be all green every day. we can and will have red days.

For example if this go's up 10k and closes on 9.2k it will be a red day, does that mean it was all for nothing? no it means the stocks have reacted to something.

So step away from the emotions you may have when looking at this and take a step back, look at the bigger picture and take a breather.

Because I've seen a lot of negativity on the subs since yesterday, which is to be expected.

Red day forecast is shilly, in the low 90 degrees and slightly overcast.

As much as we would love to see it, we're not gonna see gains of 30-40% every day. It's costing the hedgies millions each day in short interest, all we've gotta do to keep fucking them is to keep getting the sweet dip and holding.

graph of 2021, compared to where we where, this still looks great to me.

See something familiar?

This is why I keep spouting on about ""everyone should educate themselves"" the more you know the less panic you will face.

all thanks go's to [u/atrivell](https://www.reddit.com/u/atrivell/) for posting it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m2wjp8/gme_is_doing_what_its_been_doing_all_week_i_am/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

so if you look at the MACD ( **moving average convergence**/**divergence**, is a trading indicator used in technical analysis of stock prices)

as he stated:

    We've seen this action that's happening today A LOT,  
    we just haven't had people who bought at $348.50 complaining before.  
    Support lines are trending up, FASTER than last week,  
    and we have seen this buy and sell off many times in the past  
    few days when everyone was a diamond hands beast.  
    this is a simple analysis of the chart and not financial advice. 

so what does that tell us?

The support going up faster is a good indicator that you'll get a more upwards trend.

The faster that go's the higher it can go, but wtf do I know?

even Yahoo is posting about this

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-should-see-the-gme-short-squeeze-continuing-s-3-partners-174542296.html)

the most important take away is at the end:

    “This has not been a profitable trading week for GME short sellers,  
    after being down -$1.36 billion on Monday and Tuesday,” Dusaniwsky said.  
    “[Wednesday’s] +7% price move added another -$202 million in additional  
    mark-to-market losses.”  
    All in, GameStop shorts have now lost $6.8 billion year-to-date, 
    Dusaniwsky said.

Ok so people where talking about this yesterday so I thought I'd include it.

The stimulus checks will be hitting from this weekend on, just imagine what this could do, imagine what the fuck is going to happen if thousands of apes yolo their stimmy in GME... fuck guys we wouldn't need a catalyst we'd be our own haha.

But again not investment advice, Just saying this would be the funniest shit I'd see in my life if this happened

There is a letter to the board.

Ok so yesterday I was in a stream and this got brought to my attention : [https://www.stockholdersrights.com/](https://www.stockholdersrights.com/)

Their main interest is to present this on monday to the board of GME, this to do an audit of shareholders, meaning checking the shares, checking everything that's going on with the shares and to make sure the synthetic/naked shares are tracked down so something can be done against it.

So please I ask everyone to quickly sign it and make sure the board get's this on monday

Not sure who originally posted this but thank you!

This is exactly why you'll see red days before this is implemented.

Remember everything happens for a reason, red days, people spreading FUD or disinformation. we have seen this for weeks, no one folded then, no one has folded now.

again trust your fellow apes and see where this ends up.

And just to make sure because I've seen some other people saying ""Oh BuT ReNs0Le DoEsNt BeLiEve in X aMoUnt"" trust me that's the fastest way to get banned from this sub.

I believe this can hit 100,000.00 a share, you can call me an idiot for believing, you can call me a moron for having high hopes, but NEVER try to tell me or other people what they ""really"" believe""

Nice old meme right? notice something?

Cup and FUCKING handle.

Again I believe that DFV RC and GME are trying to convey messages in some way shape or form. we have found a deeper meaning behind every tweet (granted it's all conjecture until proven otherwise, none of these are facts just opinions).

Nah but in all seriousness this tweet can be taken in several ways.

He was poisoned like Gme was with the shorts, now he's squeezing so damn hard this guy is about to shoot off of the toilet.

these two scenes play together as far as I know (again correct me if I'm wrong)

Again the best advice I can give you retarded apes is when you go into this to be logical, don't let your emotions rule you, rule your emotions.

Also if you worry if this will go up or not, look at the fundamentals of the company, look how they turned around their company, look at who got brought in.

I personally think if the company is sub 1000 USD it is undervalued, again you can disagree but show me proof.

And remember none of this is financial advice, just a retards opinion.

Besides a handful of trolls (who would've thought) the response has been overwhelmingly positive. So I'm going to do my Oscars speech now.

Most of all, I want to thank all of you who feel the same way, but since that's already the point of the post I really want to thank all the DD writers over the last few weeks. Those that have poured over data and reports, found the connections and deep insights and thought about stuff that us smooth-brained apes hadn't considered like ETF shorting. You're the ones who really have been the big kittens in this whole saga and we couldn't have done it without you.

Yes, we're all in this to make some tendies in the end. Trolls pointing that out aren't winning any genius awards. But there absolutely is something more to this, there has to be an altruistic psychology and geniality to this experiment that the Wall Street mindset doesn't understand. This never would've worked if the overwhelming majority of us weren't looking out for the collective good in order to accomplish our goal and knew how to push through doubt and uncertainty and selfishness. And with those tendies, people are excited about paying off education or medical debt, helping others, and other things that aren't about greed and consumption as the primary factors in wanting to make some sauce.

I'm from the U.S., but I've really loved traveling to Europe and the UK the last couple years and did live overseas for a time. So if we do end up going to the moon, and once the pandemic situation has improved a bit, I'd love to grab a beer with those of you who are living in places like London, Paris, Amsterdam, Rome, etc. I've loved seeing the global posts so far in support. And that's what I love about this grand experiment, the idea that we find a common cause and camaraderie with strangers on the internet throughout the world. I don't know how it will end yet, but it's been quite a ride so far.

**ORIGINAL POST:**

With DFV doubling down and the return of old mods there is once again tons of GME positive sentiment, ""we're going to the moon"" memes and DD on WSB. People are talking about making the personal decision to buy back in come Monday.

Well, I'm a little salty because some of us never left and kept buying on the way down, despite the incessant barrage of criticism and FUD. We wanted to fight the shorts and support the stock. This post, however, isn't anti-DFV. He's the GOAT to us APES.

Would it have been a smarter investment to not buy any more GME after the initial crash, wait until it hit below $40, and start buying back in? Yes. Part of me is frustrated I kept buying instead of getting it all at $40 or if it continues to go even lower.

But isn't the point of all this that we're NOT smart? We're supposed to be dumb apes sending a message! What if we had all given up, or decided to wait until it got as low as it has, stopped buying and kept selling the entire way down?

If we hadn't obsessively followed new DD every day to convince us we weren't crazy to still believe, kept buying and holding, it would have been a much easier job for the shorts to get what they want. We truly held the line when it was hardest to do so, and though we may not have quite as much return on our investment we should be proud of the principle of what we did.

I'm not naive. I know that we don't really control the market and that the price area on a given day and end of week was pretty much controlled by their algos and dirty naked short-selling tactics the entire time, especially in retrospect. Knowing when certain options were expiring, ""we want it around 60 or 50 for now, we want it at below 40 by 2/19."" They have more power than us, but not all the power.

But for now, whether they were bought at $40, $50, $60, $200+...they still don't have our shares.

None of this is financial advice, everything expressed here in a retards idea of whatsup.

# OMG THE GOVERNMENT

Ok so I've read a lot of people posting shit along the lines of ""omg the government will halt this"".

So lets address that right here where it get's the most exposure.

I don't think they will for several reasons, namely;

1. This is way, way bigger than just the US. Dozens of countries are involved in this. If the U.S tried to shut down trading there would be international consequences and people would no longer trust the USA to do business with, economically isolating and crippling the USA economy for years.
2. It would completely shatter market confidence and result in an exodus of investors. I don’t think the economy would ever recover from such a betrayal.
3. It’s in the governments best interest to let this play out. Not only will they get that sweet capital gains tax, they’ll look like the good guys. It could also lead to an economic explosion as millions of retail investors put their earnings back into the economy.
4. people say ""but HF are connected"" correct but this is bigger than just citadel or Apex, this is also other whales on our side, investors are like sharks once they smell blood in the water and see an opportunity to take out 1 or 2 competitors they'll do their best to take them out.

credit to  [u/HorseFacedDipShit](https://www.reddit.com/user/HorseFacedDipShit/) for writing this, I've adapted it a bit hope you don't mind.

We are now bigger than Mutual funds and Hedgefunds combined. Just let that idea set in for a minute.

by this graph alone... well they're no longer the sharks, we are. expect them to try and pull the plug at any given time, expect them to try everything to get out of this. but I personally don't think they're going to get out from under this.

they're under the scrutinizing eye of the entire world, remember

Hf's trying to pull the plug once got us a senate hearing.

if they'd do it again it's financial suicide.

# So why have we not yet gone BRRRR

these guys have a lot to lose in this situation, so don't expect them to take everything and just roll over, a cornered animal would do everything to survive, expect a greedy HF to do the same.

Most likely (what my smooth noggin thinks) is that they're trying to stall for a simple reason, liquidate other assets, move them off shore to a bank account which the usa can't touch so they have some money for after the bankrupcy.

You only go bankrupt once.

And the rich don't go broke like the rest of us. I go broke I'm crying in an old ass Camry, they go broke and they laugh in their Bahama vacation home.

# If this break $xxx dollars I'll do ....nothing!

Because I'll be holding to 100k minimum.

if I look at the graph it tells me the last spike was $347 (nasdaq) just to give you an idea we are just a 100 bucks or so away from that RIGHT NOW.

folding at a $1000 is still paperhanding in my book but that's just me, I'll be holding for 100 times that.

because this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I don't think we will ever see a situation like this ever again. especially with the new DTCC rules that are coming in.

Adjust your baseline and expectancy, adjust your view to see big numbers and see where the nice tendyman will bring you.

Because soon will the Tendyman come to take our rocket into the sun <3

Also some decent explanation of the new DTCC rules:

# Gme going 10k-50k-100k-500k

Ok so I heard a lot of talk about ""if it go's to 100k it will ruin the economy"".

No it may ruin the stock market for a hot minute but not the economy.

why you ask? easy the Economy is not the stock market or vice versa.

first of all  'ruin the economy' is, and always has been, a dogwhistle for rich people losing their superyachts, how many times was the ""economy"" ruined and the people on wall-street went on with business as usual?

the thing is, once we get our gains and we pay the taxes the economy is back up.Due to the gains being put back into the economy right away (paying off debts, mortgages, bills in general) the economy will be healthier then ever, also we'll most likely see a lot of people start their own charity or business or something along the way.

which also stimulates the economy further.

So when they cry on tv saying ""they're ruining the economy"" no jackass we are doing the same thing to you that you did to all of us for years. the economy wont crash, the economy will flourish as people will for once be able to pay their bills, for once they'll be able to LIVE instead of EXIST to work from paycheck to paycheck.

# But how will we get paid?

IDC if Jesus Christ himself has to pay me but lets break it down.

With the new DTCC ruling (if all go's well this will be implemented on the 19th of march... hmmm familiar date 👀) then they can hold specific people accountable for specific stock debts.

Meaning for example Melvin/shitadel can go bankrupt with all the debt, and the Fed runs it's money printer and write off that debt on a bankrupt company.

this is normal when a company go's bankrupt they get a debit and Credit part, guess Kenny G will have a huge debt on his ass when this blows up.

so lets make it simple.

will you get paid? for your stocks ? yes

Will the DTCC/FED/MELVIN/SHITADEL pay for this personally? not sure, all I know is that there is no stopping this anymore, or see above.

Does it matter who pays for the stocks? no, as long as we get paid we don't care.

if you sell your car do you care who comes and pays you? no as long as you get the money you want you're cool with it.

&#x200B;

**Addendum:**

apparently I was incorrect with something here, u/[axiscontra](https://www.reddit.com/user/axiscontra)  was kind enough to correct me

1. the 801 is an advanced notice and in line with Dodd-Frank and the SEC act of 1934 an advance notice does not require input from interested parties. So no waiting for a rebuttal if the SEC approves. NSCC also states this is a clarification of the language, not a new rule or entire rule change
2. IF the Commission (SEC) approves this, then the NSCC will implement this rule change no later than 10 business days after the approval. Big difference between regular days and business days. As the SEC has not yet approved the rule change then there is no indication of when it will go into effect. However, if the SEC approves today then the NSCC can implement the change anytime from today (business day 1) up until March 23 (business day 10)

# My expectations.

I think by looking at all the data I have available in front of me

I believe that they have one last ditch effort, they're going to let it rise to close to 1k (be it 500/750 or 800 or 1000) and then drop it down. just in an effort to get most of us to paperhand.

[u/OurLordOfWar](https://www.reddit.com/user/OurLordOfWar/)  did a write up [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1n88r/they_will_more_than_likely_short_gme_at_1k/)

But let me surmise;

    They will let it rise.
    $500? $800? $1000?
    
    And as their last resource. They will make it drop RIGHT THERE and start with the media saying, that was it. That was the squeeze.
    
    The shills will spread FUD
    
    The shills will post gains that are tempting to the eye. Making you want to do the same.
    
    They will sooth your smooth brain with false words and false DD.
    
    They might go as far as closing all subreddits to cut communication and cause panic.
    
    An animal that is cornered and about to die will fight with everything they got. 

Now I hope with this you understand why we put in the ""posting age requirement"" and banned ""gain and loss porn"".

This is something we could see coming a mile away, but this time let's be smarten then them.

# 🚨PSA: NEW SHILL TACTIC IS TO ANNOUNCE WHOLESOME/CHARITY DEEDS ALONG WITH A LOW GME PRICE TAG LIKE 1K OR 10K

[u/slash\_sin\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/slash_sin_/)  did a writeup on this and seems dead on with it.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1f0cy/psa\_new\_shill\_tactic\_is\_to\_announce/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m1f0cy/psa_new_shill_tactic_is_to_announce/)

Lot's of people saying ""oh but I will donate to ST. Jude childrens hospital.

Sounds awesome right? well if you're in the UK you know that ST. Jude is one of the most overfunded childrens hospitals in Europe. they have multiple charity drives each year, which includes a comedy show they have yearly on tv to get donations.

So whenever you hear ""my donations will go to ST. Jude"" be weary.

Also when you see a lowball number (yes I believe 1 and 10 k are low in this situation) then be extra vigilant. why you may ask easy.

This is a psychological trick,  a cognitive bias called “price anchoring” described by researchers Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman if you’ve ever read the book Thinking Fast Thinking Slow.

“Anchoring or focalism is a cognitive bias where an individual depends too heavily on an initial piece of information offered to make subsequent judgments during decision making. Once the value of this anchor is set, all future negotiations, arguments, estimates, etc. are discussed in relation to the anchor.”

Often a tactic used in pricing goods or negotiation.

Classical conditioning sets you in a specific mindset, like pavlov had with the dogs. you hear a bell and you start salivating because you know hey it's food time.

Same go's if someone says hey 1k is the goal over and over, you start to believe that.

So from this point on if someone posts a low ball 1/10k ""My GaIn$ wIlL Go To X when 1/10k"" I'll just delete these threads because they're bullshit, 1k is the minimum this stock was thought to do by both Ryan Cohen and RC Ventures and Domo Capital.

**1K IS NOT A SQUEEZE!**

thanks to  u/ellosee for pointing out the ""price Anchoring""

Don't over focus on what they're doing, expect fuckery, but keep your eye on the prize people.

focus on your moon, on all that heavenly glory, and let it bring you calm that we have slowly but surely been gaining momentum once more.

These guys will run out of money at some point, if the DTCC rule kicks in and they're still in this they are most likely fucked. as the DTCC can say ""pay up bitch"" and they're done within a week.

Don't expect the HF who oppose us to give up, they'll fight you to their very last breath however they can. but know we are currently at the time of writing on 242 euro thats $288 USD. again going up massively. we may be moving slow, but we are moving.

I stumbled across [this sweet little screenshot from eToro](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7r42a/everyone_on_etoro_is_long_on_gme/) posted by u/kapein which shows that **9.11%** of all eToro users are holding GME. (Update as of 30/03/2021: still standing at 9.02%)

&#x200B;

[credits to u\/kapein](https://preview.redd.it/oqd5jj2prtn61.png?width=386&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bd0a24b23e1da28f023594848891bd3a781bb46)

So i thought to myself, why don't we take this percentage and try to get an estimation about how many apes in total are holding GME right now and see where some variables regarding shares per ape get us. Are you exicted? Because **I AM**, LETS GO! 🚀🚀🚀

I spent the last hour(s) or so researching the largest broker firms and gathered their total user numbers. This list is **by far not complete** which means that the % held by retail investors could be **way way (!)** higher than my estimates. Please let me know if you have access to more brokers data and i will update my list.

Some friendly ape posted a statement from neo-broker Wealthsimple, thats states a GME-ownership of [up to 14%](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/magazine/gme-data) (!) of their total users. Therefore I made assumptions regarding the share of users that invested in GME for each broker. For neo-brokers like eToro, Robinhood, Revolut and WeBull I went with an average of 10% GME ownership of all users. (*EDIT 3: Also included a scenario for only 5% GME-ownership, as some raised concerns that my 10% assumption may be too optimistic.)*

Of course we have to consider that the average eToro user might have a higher risk tolerance and is more likely to invest in GME compared to average Joe. So for ""classic"" brokers that are more known for ""passive investing"" like Vanguard or Schwab I went with a lower share of users that are invested in GameStop. Some brokers from the Nordics report an ownership of [around 1.5% - 2.0%](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no_doubt/grebfmc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of their users.

From the godlike [Due Diligence](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/) that is around since yesterday I took the total remaining float that is accessible to retail investors, which is only **19.3m shares**. *(The rest is in hands of ""single"" shareholders like Ryan Cohan, BlackRock, etc..)*

Okay, now that we have a vague feeling of how many GME retail investors we are, lets play with some scenarios.

&#x200B;

**Scenario 1: GME-ownership of 10% for neo-brokers and 1.5% for classic investment platforms:**

[&#37; of remaining float that is held by retail \(Scenario 1\)](https://preview.redd.it/eb99z717i8o61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=75a7195987db9ed41b8407eaa0c1e3cacc56a627)

&#x200B;

**Scenario 2: GME-ownership of 5% for neo-brokers and 1.5% for classic investment platforms:**

[&#37; of remaining float that is held by retail \(Scenario 2\)](https://preview.redd.it/i8fahnkgi8o61.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=0849de187deb52bafb8604c8566def34cb819714)

&#x200B;

As you can see above, if the average ape is holding **only** 5 shares, we would own **more than 150%** of the total remaining float. Even in Scenario 2, which is more conservative, it is more than 125% (!). To be honest i believe that the average ape holds not only 5 shares. There is a good chance that this numbers is more like 25+ shares per ape. Some fellow ape made a comment where he calculated an average of [40 shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no_doubt/grebfmc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) per invested user for his broker. I know, i know, there are a lot of apes that only hold 1 or 2 bananas or even fractional shares, but dont forget that there are real retail whales like u/deepfuckingvalue or u/HeyItsPixel who own thousands, ten-thousands or even hundred-thousands shares! If we estimate 25 shares for the average ape, we would own around 800% (!!!) of the entire remaining float. Thats just fucking insane! There seems to be **a ton** of synthetic and counterfeit shares around.

Even if there are plenty catalysts, that are still open and likely possible, **a share callback from GameStop should send us to Andromeda and beyond.**

I am literally shaking writing this down. We are about to make history!

MELVIN AND SHITADEL WILL FUCKING EXPLODE! THERE IS **NO WAY OUT**! 🚀🚀🚀

**IMPORTANT:** If you have access to more detailed data regarding number of users or even GME-ownership for a specific broker, please let me know via dm. There are too many comments here and it's hard to keep track of all of them. And please add your source (link or screenshot) so I can publish this here as well.

&#x200B;

EDIT 1: Made some amendments regarding assumptions for GME ownership, divided into neo-brokers and classic brokers. Added multiple brokers from CA, EU and UK. Please let me know if you are missing a broker and have the respective data about GME-ownership and/or total users for that broker.

EDIT 2: Many brother (and sister) apes from Australia and New Zealand reached out to me. Special thanks to u/wawa-weewa who provided me with data for the brokers Sharesies & Hatch. According to these both brokers GME ownership is 3.60% and 2.00%. (Source ~~not~~ confirmed, ~~will add once~~ [available here](https://www.interest.co.nz/personal-finance/108826/thousands-nzers-partake-gamestop-movement-sharesies-users-alone-make-20)).

EDIT 3: u/eoinythegod pointed out that my assumptions of Revoluts 12m investors might be misleading as Revolut also provides standard bank accounts. Unfortunatly there is no reporting about trading-only accounts for Revolut, so i guesstimated that around 10% of all Revolut users might use the trading option. If you should have more detailed data, please let me know. Also included a second scenario where only 5% of neo-brokers hold GME (which is very low imo, but some users raised concerns that my 10% assumption might be too optimistic).

&#x200B;

THIS OVERVIEW WILL BE UPDATED ON A REGULAR BASIS!!

*(no financial advise in any way)*

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

There is no way that retail holds less than 100% of the remaining float, the actuals number might be much (!!!) higher, maybe even in the 1000%+. Buckle up, because this rocket is about to enter fucking lightspeed! 🚀🚀🚀

But I think a lot of people still don't realize how low this number actually is.  We can compare GME to other hard to borrow stocks last week.

[Trader's insight recently put out a report of the top 15 hardest to borrow stocks, and GME made the list at position number 3](https://www.tradersinsight.news/traders-insight/securities/securities-lending/securities-lending-report-3-22-21-3-26-21/)

By pulling data from [iBorrowDesk](http://iborrowdesk.com/) and [FinViz](https://finviz.com/), we can compare our favorite ticker to some of these other stocks and get a sense of what is going on with GME.

| 15 | IMMP | 550000 | 66.60% | 61.5M | 0.895% |

This is insane.  Not only does GME have by far the fewest number of shares to borrow, but the fee is almost nothing.  It's hard to get a sense of how far out of whack GME is with the rest of the universe from numbers, so I made a chart to help visualize the gap:

https://imgur.com/a/rAdI591

On the X-axis, we have the normalized available shares, which is available shares to borrow / float.  On the y-axis we can see the borrow fee.  I had to make this **LOG SCALE** in order to be able to even see anything due to how distorted the numbers are with GME.  There is a general trend that as the available borrow shares goes down, you see borrow fees go up (though some stocks have generally more shares and may be more liquid, affecting these numbers).  We can see that TKAT's borrow fee is quite high at 543%, given that there are almost no shares available to borrow right now.

*But LOOK AT GME!*  GME has even fewer shares available as a percentage of its float (they even ran out last week), and yet the borrow rate is almost 0.  This is so out of whack that clearly something crazy is going on.  I consider this strong evidence of some kind of collusion between the banks lending shares to manipulate the borrow fees for GME.  There is no way that the fee should be so low.

The problem being: SEC allowing naked short-selling bankrupting companies so extensively that rules are created after the damage is done and made public by Redditors that will result in the stock market being liquidated one and only one time to allow a permanent fix to kick in.

Update: Let’s remain cautious. The DTCC has long been known to be complicit to allowing harmful naked short-selling and none of these rules are eliminating it.

Now I have to give a HUGE shoutout to  [u/aNinjaAtNight](https://www.reddit.com/user/aNinjaAtNight/)  he was so awesome he checked the FTD's of EVERY ETF that contains GME, so check out his thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m63jfb/ftd_of_62_etfs_that_contained_gme/)

the most important one is his exel sheet he's got [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PZ2-hnCtDNRnbE8Wm5ByudBcg26T3lGjsec9bSE9x9I/edit#gid=0)

his research shows that the ETF's on their own are close to 900,000 FTD shares

So that makes a total of 1,200,000 FTD's.

And please keep in mind Shorts and FTD's are all self reported, so it could be a lot more than this.

Unfortunately we've learned that sometimes the data can be unreliable.

&#x200B;

The FTD's of the ETF's also fall in line with GME being shorted VIA the ETF's

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m5v1xy/i\_think\_its\_quite\_evident\_they\_shorted\_gme/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m5v1xy/i_think_its_quite_evident_they_shorted_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

&#x200B;

Also keep in mind these are JUST the FTD's that are traded with the DTCC, this does not account for the ones traded OUTSIDE of the DTCC. (there was an entire thread going into detail why this was important but I can't seem to find it atm if anyone can link me I'd really appreciate it).

# the name is Bonds, Shit bonds.

So what else have we seen in the past days, oh right The bonds!

So what do these bonds mean? very simply put, Citadel needs money.

A lot of money.

[https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/videos/capital-markets-view-february-2021](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/videos/capital-markets-view-february-2021)

lets speculate for a moment, Citadel has been paying a lot of money to be able to kick the can down the road, like a lot of money, billions at this point. and to be honest they will try to elongate this as long as possible.

These guys are used to winning, so don't expect them to take this all laying down, expect fuckery, expect dips expect bots spreading FUD and bullshit.

the thing that was eye catching to me in the bonds are a few things.

1. Ratings BBB- (S&P)this is just above shit tier, BBB- is bad
2. Coupon 3.375%This is a high bond yield % so them offering such a high % shows how badly they need the money
3. Notes Proceeds for general corporate purposesAKA gib money for bonusses.

So the SR-NSCC-2021-801 filing that we have been waiting for is one step closer to passing.

[https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings)

Today the DTC submitted a filing DTC-2021-003 which eliminated the requirement that a Participant must confirm its activity statements monthly through DTC’s Participant Inquiry Notification System (PINS) system. In short the HF’s and MM’s no longer have to submit data to DTC/DTCC monthly on shorts, longs, or any other relevant information that can be used for the monthly risk assessment that is currently being used. Best part is that the Deputy General Counsel of the DTC approved this change on January 14, 2020 and the Effective date is listed as “The proposed rule change would become effective upon filling” which this was filed today, March 15, 2021.

The SR-NSCC-2021-801 is an advance notice filing that only required the SEC to approve before NSCC “Implements proposed rule changes no later than 10 business days after approval by the Commission”. For those of you too smooth to remember the 801 will allow the NSCC to assess the risk of members daily and let them demand a higher Secondary Liquidity Deposit (SLD) daily if the member would risk defaulting. The 801 basically makes HF’s and MM’s pay more if they are playing too risky and can let the DTCC liquidate the member’s positions if it could risk the NSCC’s ability to complete that day’s trades.

Edit: addition from [u/swimmerchild](https://www.reddit.com/u/swimmerchild/) \*Hi. This is a good thing. Basically they cant have a rule that says they have to report once a month and another that they have to report daily. It’s one or the other, and they just tossed out the monthly one

Edit 2: please direct any and all questions to [u/swimmerchild](https://www.reddit.com/u/swimmerchild/) This person is the true OP of this post.

Also the link where you can see when the new rule passes: [https://www.dtcc.com/legal/important-notices?pgs=1](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/important-notices?pgs=1)

the fact that we are seeing changes is a good one in my book, how it will be implemented is something we will have to see how that turns out. I hope that we get some stricter regulations or better yet, remove the ability to short in total but that's just a pipe dream right now.

# Patience.

Ok so this is something I need to drive home, each and every day, at every step remember.

these guys wont play fair, they never did they never will.

we will see fuckery because lets be honest would you in their position?

March 19th has been marked in our calendar AND ALSO THEIRS! so expect the worst case scenario.

expect this to go down a lot, they'll try to destroy morale in every possible way, this is a literal war of attrition, not a race but a marathon.

This is NOT something that will come easy, this will separate the boys from the men as this is a very simple thing, relax sit back and learn some patience.

The only things we can do is grab the dips and hodl, that's it, they will flood the boards with Fud, they will try to make it look like this was all over and now well look at this other stock!

Just keep level headed, stay relaxed this is nothing more than waiting for it to go pop.

Because when GME hit's that shiny nice launch button there is nothing the hedgies can do.

The board can call an emergency shareholder meeting whenever they deem fit.

They can recall shares for a number of reasons, or do a reverse stock split or whatever.

Remember we have seen WEEKS of red, we have at this point grown accustomed to it, to the new people relax this is something you'll get used to, and if you get nervous look at the fundamentals. I believe in this company and I love the stock.

# Kill them with kindness.

Remember everyone please, be super nice, OVERLY nice to everyone here.

This has made it so easy to spot the Shills and the noobs get more help, making paperhands slowly turn to diamondhanded apes.

But suddenly we get a lot of people saying bad stuff about me Broviet Pixel and the entire mod team, funny how I wrote about it yesterday and it's already happening totally not expected 🙄🙄🙄

Remember: APE FRIENDLY, APE DONT FIGHT APE!

Again as always none of this is financial advice I eat off brand crayons

# Options

Ok this needs to be stated and everyone needs to get this through their ape skulls.

Options calls puts everything like that, you need to understand a 100% of what these mean and how they work, if you don't know everything about them BE CAREFULL.

Options are dangerous if you don't know how they work.

Edit 2:

u/the_captain_slog raised a good point which I think should also be read.

 

**That is not what the DTCC change means. DTCC is a clearinghouse. They already have records of all shorts, longs, options, warrants, etc. that members are clearing.** **The rule change is about the participants (aka hedge funds) confirming the information in the reports provided by DTCC.** The rule change is the top one here: [https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings)

The following is from the Background section that states the rationale for the rule change.

*Paragraph 1: ""DTC provides regular reports and statements to Participants showing their settlement activity; this includes activity, risk control monitoring and settlement reports. The Procedures of DTC require Participants to reconcile both their activity and positions with DTC upon receipt of applicable daily activity statements at the end of each day and to immediately report any discrepancies. Participants must also provide a month-end confirmation of their activity.""*

Again, they already know what participants do because they are the clearinghouse. The reporting is not being done by the hedge funds. This is being provided to the hedge funds.

*Paragraph 2: ""With respect to the month-end confirmation, the PTS/PBS Guides require each Participant to reconcile and confirm with DTC its month-end securities positions listed on its DTC monthly statement of positions (“Monthly Position Statement”). 7 No later than the 10th business day after the last Friday of the month, the Participant must confirm the accuracy of the position statement electronically via PINS.""*

Under the old rules, once a month they required the participants to confirm their statements (i.e. check if they got it right). Remember, the new liquidity deposit change? The positions are what they must collateralize.

*Finally, last paragraph in the section: ""DTC believes that the requirement for Participants to submit a month-end confirmation of positions is no longer necessary for DTC or its Participants to ensure prompt and accurate reconciliations by Participants of their activity. In the past, Participants frequently received hard copy reports relating to their DTC activity, which could take longer to process and reconcile than electronic reports. Today, reports and statements are offered exclusively in electronic form, which facilitates the daily reconciliation of activity by Participants in a prompt and accurate manner through automated means.""*

So because we have moved online and are no longer dealing with paper statements, DTCC is removing the monthly confirmation requirement for members to verify that the positions listed are correct. They have guaranteed access to the statements every day electronically and don't need to wait on mail to arrive. Think of the DTCC statement like your bank statement. People used to wait for bank statements to arrive and balance checkbooks to know what their balances were before online banking told you your balance every day. Now that we have online banking, no one balances manually checkbooks and talks to the bank about discrepancies (except maybe my grandma).

Also, remember that liquidity collateral is based on positions. If DTCC is expecting to require members to post additional liquidity - which we all think is likely - a very reasonable stall tactic could have been ""oh, I haven't balanced my checkbook yet - let me get back you about that liquidity in 10 days after I reviewed."" So, this is a positive change because now they can't buy time with that cover.

\-----

Changing topic to the bonds, again, as I have posted this a couple times: I don't think it's a signal that they're bleeding money. Citadel generally does a bond raise every 2 years. General corporate purposes is also a catch-all use of proceeds that pretty much everyone uses. In my \~15 years working on capital raises, it was included in almost every deal that I saw.

Here's a link to how S&P rates long term corporate issues: [https://www.standardandpoors.com/en\_US/web/guest/article/-/view/sourceId/504352](https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/article/-/view/sourceId/504352)

BBB- is a better credit score than most of us have. It's not ""shit tier"" at all. Most issuers are BBB +/- rated. You can read what the scores mean on that chart. I'd also hesitate to call it ultra high yield. The video you linked to actually talks about spreads in the +300-400 bps range, so that's in line. Maybe someone with a bloomberg terminal can pull current credit spreads on corporate senior debt issuances by rating to check, and that would be interesting.

Remember, debt is an IOU. This one was also $1,000 denomination which indicates to me that it was an institutional offering. Fellow banks and institutions are not going to take 3.75% rate on debt from someone if they don't think they can pay it back. They'd want much higher yields to correspond to the higher risk (like when someone tries to get a car loan or mortgage - higher risk = higher rate).

There has been some deterioration in their credit rating since the last issuance in 2019, which is noteworthy.

One very important thing for everyone to consider when reading news: **Gamestop, DTCC, Citadel, Melvin, etc.... these are all operating businesses who must continue to operate in the normal course of business through this.** If Citadel generally does a bond raise every two years, they're going to do a bond raise. If GME sends marketing tweets about sales, they're going to keep tweeting. And so on. Not everything is about us and the stock. We should get over ourselves a bit when investigating corporate actions.

Also, remember to **stay skeptical of what you read. A quick google search has debunked or provoked questions about a lot of the ""factual information"" presented to the sub lately**. Skepticism is healthy. There's also some really interesting information buried in a lot of the bad interpretations, so it's doubly frustrating at times.",2021-03-16 11:31:00

# I will livestream every Monday 9:15 AM EST, and do regular Reddit posts every day, even during streams. Last stream I was just adjusting so didn't do a post during that stream.

**If you want to support me, check my Reddit profile bio. I appreciate you guys!**

**Historical support and resistance levels for reference today:**

152.5, 172, 183.5, 184.5, 187.5, 190.5, 192, 195, 197.5, 200, 209, 211.5, 214.5, 218, 226, 230, 234, 243, 250, 253, 256.5

172 diagonal support (see 26:31 in my livestream video)

**Edit 39 5:55PM:**

The media will spread FUD. They will short attack this.

**There is nothing wrong with the earnings.** It's only a bit disappointing for apes who were expecting rocket fuel from earnings.

Expect some wild swings tomorrow. Cya then.

**Edit 38 5:50PM:**

>The timing and amount of sales under the ATM Program would depend on, among other factors, our capital needs and alternative sources and costs of capital available to us, market perceptions about us, and the then current trading price of our Class A Common Stock

I like how CNBC doesn't mention this part of the ATM Program on the 10K. A) They won't sell anytime soon, this will destroy market perceptions. B) They have a ton of cash on hand.

Don't worry about them selling shares anytime soon folks.

**Edit 37 5:38PM:**

CNBC FUD article came out about how GameStop may sell stock to fund transformation: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/gamestop-shares-rise-on-e-commerce-sales-jump-new-coo.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/gamestop-shares-rise-on-e-commerce-sales-jump-new-coo.html)

lol. Did they read their Balance Sheet?

**GameStop has 508.5m cash. Doesn't seem like they will sell. (edit: removed all caps, I'm now checking their filings about S/E)**

&#x200B;

**Edit 36 5:35PM:**

**On Monday's stream, I will also go over the financial statements** and make it all easy to understand.

**Edit 35 5:27PM:**

# I'm gonna hold.

# The earnings call was good. Low volume right now in selling. Around 50k a minute. (There is not really much panic selling at all by reading the volume)

Yes I know, this call did not add rocket fuel to the rocket.

In my opinion, from the earnings call and reading their 10K, **there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the company.** This was a reasonable earnings call.

**Edit 34 5:26PM:**

Due to a lack of guidance, the stock, as I have warned, will be shorted. Testing the 152.5 support.

https://preview.redd.it/gza0prziiuo61.png?width=2133&format=png&auto=webp&s=130e4702664873b3972d2a4d172a7137c33bc50d

**Edit 33 5:24PM:**

I think generally this is good. They are transitioning from brick and mortar to e-Commerce. Though I think people were expecting a miracle or something, but again like I said, Q4 was expected to be affected. Forward looking expectations look good.

**Edit 32 5:20PM:**

The statement of operations

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/foujsyqthuo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d41e1422ceb4b9789a3732499dc20fd134489b6

Reducing net loss. Lots of administrative expenses reduced likely due to store closures. This is **good.**

**Edit 31 5:15PM:**

In laymen's terms, COVID has reduced current assets, but liabilities have decreased at the same time. This is perfectly normal and a good forward looking sign.

**Edit 31 5:14PM:**

The balance sheet.

https://preview.redd.it/m5zdarn2huo61.png?width=803&format=png&auto=webp&s=b956c7226238b93c7b11959bb49c6f95a927e3d7

I see really GOOD things happening. As expected, COVID reduced **inventories and net receivables,** but, at the same time, **long term debt has been decreased and lease liabilities have also decreased. This is evidence of a continued shift towards an online business model.**

**Edit 30 5:13PM:**

>The COVID-19 pandemic could potentially cause material disruptions or delays in our supply chains that develop, manufacture and distribute new consoles and other products we sell. Such disruptions could result in lower levels of sales of next generation consoles as well as the accompanying video games and other products we sell, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

Again, nothing too surprising.

I'm looking for forward looking figures now to see how the future will look.

**Edit 29 5:07PM:**

COVID impacting sales from stores. Narrow EPS miss. Nothing alarming so far. Still reading through reports. [https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/55a92a3e-144e-4d2b-8ee6-930db9045593](https://news.gamestop.com/static-files/55a92a3e-144e-4d2b-8ee6-930db9045593)

The 10K is useful here to skim through.

**Edit 28 5:00PM:**

Let the earnings call begin!

**Edit 27 4:00PM:**

Closing around 181. Even power hour volume was pretty low. This earnings call is going to be really important. I won't be streaming the call since I prefer to concentrate on the financials. I will keep updating this doc with any large green or red flags I notice. See you all at earnings! 5PM EST  [https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1424794&tp\_key=d5ec83cadf](https://viavid.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1424794&tp_key=d5ec83cadf)

**Edit 26 3:56PM:**

Volatility going up during power hour. Some pretty moderate swings before close.

**Edit 25 3:48PM:**

# Forgot to put underscores in B_T_C so the post got autoremoved haha.

**Edit 24 3:40PM:**

**It is my belief that shorts on GME are ""pair trading"" by going long on B\_T\_C when GME is down, and going short on B\_T\_C when GME is up.** They are able to counteract the movements of GME by doing the opposite trade on B\_T\_C. I will delve much deeper into this next Monday during my stream.

**Edit 23 3:33PM:**

The VIX is a volatility index. When the VIX goes up, it usually means funds are selling off and obtaining cash to short or to put into something else like bonds, mutual funds, commodities, or... GME.

**Edit 22 3:27PM:**

B\_T\_C ready to fall, VIX ready to spike. The start of another moon expedition for GME?

**Edit 17 2:34PM:**

Couple dips. Couple peaks. All just white noise. Volume too low for anything interesting to happen. Possible bounce at 184.5.

**Edit 16 1:33PM:**

For those that want to see all the nearby lines I drew. The blue lines aren't exact, but they are roughly around the numbers I listed above:

**Edit 15 1:24PM:**

And yes I'll be editing this post throughout earnings.

**Edit 14 1:22PM:**

There are two types of good earnings. Those that are priced-in, and those that blow the stock out of the stratosphere.

**Edit 13 1:19PM:**

Some minor volume coming in. Making a move to the 192 resistance and reversing a bit. **Forgot to add 192 to the list of resistances, added that now.**

**Edit 12 12:38PM:**

# IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: WHAT TO EXPECT FOR EARNINGS

If long term projections are good: doesn't matter if Q4 was bad: HOLD. **They will short attack and dump the price to induce fear. Ignore it. They will use the media to spread FUD. IGNORE.**

https://preview.redd.it/zuwmicyo3to61.png?width=2093&format=png&auto=webp&s=78f1aa8e807c9498eb6c0ed53c8870249c2f71f1

I don't believe earnings can go badly, **but hey, no one is always right.** No one is like Cassandra.

**Edit 11 12:21PM:**

Nothing too interesting happening. Might have to wait for power hour. Will update this if anything crazy happens.

**Edit 10 12:03PM:**

Small bounce on 184.5 (**new support added**).

**Edit 9 11:45AM:**

The tail of this pattern is slightly sagging.

https://preview.redd.it/7og88ujguso61.png?width=2144&format=png&auto=webp&s=b227f721d9649b48729fa62a5d65a7a08f7e3c74

**Edit 8 11:35AM:**

**Anatomy of a low volume day (almost no humans or institutions). My personal speculation based on observations.**

These kinds of ultra low volume days are **rare.** Patterns are easier to predict because LFTs (low frequency trading) and HFTs are more predictable when they establish the trend for the entire day. Let me illustrate.

https://preview.redd.it/busvlvftsso61.png?width=2093&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6835213377d13d08eb989ca60f1fa89f76847b6

First low frequency trading algos will selloff according to their swing trading strategy. Especially if the premarket is in the green due to the principle of mean reversion. This creates a downward trend that all the HFTs pick up on. This results in price breaking through a couple support levels.

The HFTs eventually cover and buy the dip. This creates a consolidation. However after that, the buy demand is low and eventually the stock hugs the floor for a while. Eventually HFTs begin buying more, again by the concept of mean reversion, and the price returns to near VWAP. The price usually sags and consolidates at the end if no volume picks up.

**Edit 7 11:22AM:**

Seems to be reversing earlier. **New support and resistance lines created. 190.5. 187.5.**

**Edit 6 11:09AM:**

Woops realized my chart was too zoomed in for the 9:40am prediction. My bad! The drawing should be shifted down 1 support level.

https://preview.redd.it/zana15rfnso61.png?width=2138&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7a04a1abbe975b4f1e548867ea17d5af661d10a

**Edit 5 11:03AM:**

Trading a bit below the 172 diagonal. I think it's normal because of the low volume, as well as the broader market in the red.

https://preview.redd.it/3i8swt9ylso61.png?width=2139&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffaf83d449f4e60f1bfe49961998d6021cbeea19

**Edit 5 10:19AM:**

Still following the prediction so far, gonna let it play out and see where it diverges.

**Edit 4 9:40AM:**

Super rough prediction.

Volume super super low. Around 250k 1st minute candle. I think today will be pretty boring until earnings comes around.

Goooooooooooooood morning my fellow apes!

You smell that? What is that?

That's right. Customer experience.

Frank Hamlin resigned from GameStop, the second executive departure. I think is a great sign of change. Ryan is really transforming the entire company and bringing in his guys to do their magic, and kicking out the old guys.

Well anyways, I got some midterms to deal with today, so my updates will be a bit rough today. Sorry all!

None of this is financial advice, just retarded opinions.

# Daylight Savings.

Guys starting from today NYC will have Daylight savings on, this means that the market will close and open one hour earlier for everyone outside of the DST.

it's a small thing but people need to be aware of this ;)

# STIMMAY!

So as most people know a lot of people's stimmy's should be hitting the USA in the past weekend, but do keep in mind that not everyone will have received theirs by now.

Meaning there will be some who have it and some who wont have.

So don't worry if you don't see everything launch into the stratosphere today.

Remember this is a war of attrition, a marathon, not a race to the finish this will take some time.

Same goes with other indicators, we have a lot surrounding the end of this week like the 19th, but this is not a guarantee that everything will go as planned, remember that melvin and the like will have people crawling through all the GME related subs and they want to cause as much damage as they can. and demoralizing is one of the easiest ways, so please for the love of Harambe don't set hard dates but let this bastard come at it's own pace.

Remember ""the big short"" ? you know how long Dr. Michael burry waited for his bet to pay out? 2 years, so you guys should be able to wait a few weeks maybe even months if need be.

Nothing in this world that's worth anything ever came to you easy, it always needed pain effort and time, why should this be any different?

# Hi shilly, I hope you're eating enough <3

Ok so in the weekend a lot of people (including me) have noticed a huge influx of shills.

Funnily enough with DFV's latest tweet domo replied and got my smooth brain an extra wrinkle.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lw04s5umv5n61.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=5134df1bdc99459d65398d000f8707c9684e1f6a

DFV's tweet is the ""Clint Eastwood from the gorillaz""

This can have several meanings, it can be referencing that WSB started donating to gorilla sanctuaries (which isn't out of the norm for them) or a reference to some part of the lyrics in there.

    I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
    I got sunshine in a bag
    I'm useless but not for long
    The future is coming on

But what really got my head going was Domo capitals tweet.

"" A virus that invades a host, and tricks the body it into attacking itself by pretending to be something it's not...  Sounds like something

[@DOMOCAPITAL](https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL)

has been discussing. ""

Now  they've talked about ""false idols"" before namely the ""viking of stocks"".

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ti99u6kaw5n61.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=06936bebdefebe8025cf2e8ef25fc2b91b173aeb

Apparently this viking guy has been hyping GME then dropping it and has done so twice, which in and of itself is weird for someone who says they're a ""professional"" investor, or hell anyone who understands our culture in any way shape or form.

So WTF did Domo Capital mean?

Well take the Virus part out and you have the basis for a ""false flag"" campaign.

And I hear you asking... wtf is a false flag?

check out these links:

[https://www.csoonline.com/article/3512027/what-is-a-false-flag-how-state-based-hackers-cover-their-tracks.html](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3512027/what-is-a-false-flag-how-state-based-hackers-cover-their-tracks.html)

you may have heard of this term in the news in the past few years ""Hackers from Russia"" if a hacker knows how to hack he knows how to hide his trail and use so many proxy's that no one will ever find him so convenient that they left that off right in Russia right?

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False\_flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag)

[https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/false-flag/](https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/false-flag/)

&#x200B;

So how the fuck does this work with GME?

Easy remember all the shills and the bots that we have in here? by technical terms, they are running a false flag operation.

How is that even useful? also easy, divide and conquer.

The shills are in here, nothing we can do against that, they will use all sort of tricks ranging from ""price anchoring"" [price anchoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) all the way to spreading FUD.

Now first of all let's kill the price anchoring right here, RC ventures stated to his letter to the board that he thought the price of GME should be around $1000 by the end of this year (if someone can check if it was this letter or another one let me know).

Also he stated in an hour long conversation with Domo Capital that it should be around $1000 bucks a piece as well

https://preview.redd.it/fk58ff0ky5n61.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8b138c3e78977d777e8be41918e0f14627c20af1

&#x200B;

So what does that mean?

The price of GME can go to 1000 usd per share, ON-ITS-OWN.

This means without a squeeze, without any other shit except fundamentals.

and this is why if someone asks me ""oh it's now 900/1000 is this the squeeze?"" in my view it's easy, NO.

Anyone at this point who thinks that 1000 is the goal doesn't understand how this works.

Also it would be very convenient for Melvin and Shitadel if it stays at that price, why? because if this goes to 6k or 10k they're bankrupt, someone posted here yesterday how their overall value was somewhere along the lines of 5,500 a share anything over that and they'd go bankrupt.

so here is why the price anchoring comes back into play.

The people spamming 1k is enough or oh once it hits 1k we are done with everything.

No my friends that's where the Mother Of All Short Squeezes comes in, the MOASS.

once it hit's 1,000 and no one sells they're still going to need to buy all the shares, and if they can't the price will keep going up and up and up. that has been the backbone of every theory on here. if the people keep holding and the bid/ask divide gets larger the higher the price will go.

This is why you're seeing people say 100,000 is my price or 500,000 because the mechanics support this. if no one is selling and they get margin called to buy everything in the market but no one is selling **POP GOES THE WEASEL.**

so this is why shills come in here, to make people waiver, to make people second guess themselves and their price. because if they succeed their company may survive, if they don't the company is done for.

So don't get divided by them, stop thinking everyone with a different opinion is a shill.**STOP INFIGHTING! APES DONT FIGHT APES!**

**Be Nice, OVERLY nice to one and other. why? because this is the easiest way to weed these idiots out, if everyone is helpful and nice these fuckers will stand out like a sore thumb.**

And for the love of god, stop worshipping people, this will only help them not you.

# The Gorillaz

So there has been some bitching and moaning about the altruistic ventures of Wallstreetbets. These professional retards have donated to an animal sanctuary to help out our fellow apes.

This isn't shill tactics this is WSB doing what they've always done, spend money.

Don't forget there are some actual whales on WSB, and spending a couple of hundred bucks is nothing to them nor will it ever be.

And to be clear, during the week when the market is open this is PURE GME ALL THE TIME! Meaning we wont accept any of these post.

# Some final thoughts.

First of all people need to understand that I'm only one guy, I get tagged in a lot of things to look over, and receive over a thousand pings per day, so it's impossible to read them all and some things get missed.

I've seen people in the weekend trying to discredit me because I didn't read their DD and they got pissed off over it, even going as far as calling me a shill. Guys I'd love to be able to read everything and check everything but this is not humanly possible.

Same goes with DMs.

What I do however think is that this may be a new shill tactic, Discredit the main people who are involved with this so they can take out the center players in this and it's easier to spread fud.

Question everything and everyone, just take it easy and don't attack everyone, remember play extremely nice, treat every fucker on this board as if it's your first date with a hot chick (or dude) and you want to be nice to get a chance right?

if we play overly nice they can't divide us as easy.

Apes together strong.Apes don't fight Apes.

And remember guys this has been a great week, just a month ago this was at 40 and people told us this was over remember that? now we are up to $284 in premarket.

**We can remain patient longer than they can stay solvent.**

Edit 1:

I almost forgot to mention

# EXPECT FUCKERY!

seriously we all have such high hopes for the next 2 weeks, so don't expect them to take this laying down, they will try to knock the price down, they will try to demoralize you.

Expect everything, both the price soaring up to Mars and expect it to go back to $40.

Why $40? because we've been there before and we all held through the lows and we will hodl through the highs. expect the worst and hope for the best.

Melvin/shitadel if you're reading this just know, we are not your standard traders, we're retarded apes we don't care how long this takes, but we will wait you out. remember we don't care about dates we care about one single thing, tendies.

And we can wait <3

Edit: wow, that took off, let me clarify a few things here so I am perfectly clear with all of you.

1st: I went all in on the stock and I don't really get any support from my family for it. They think the stock market is rigged against retail investors. They slowly seem to understand this is something huge, something new and unprecedented.

2nd: I am absolutely pro charity. Donate how much you want and to who ever you want. But keep in mind: 100$ today could be 100k the next month. No body knows but realise how much more good we can do to the world if we simply wait out a little bit longer. Some of us are pretty close to the poverty line because of the stupid virus thing. Make sure you can survive first before yoloing all your monthly money and eventually end up starving. 


The moon is close my fellow apes, but we are aiming for Andromeda. Let's slingshot maneuver this rocket at the moon and go to jupiter. The gamma squeeze will be this sling shot and it will be glorious but just a shadow of what will come when we reach tendie town.

Edit 2: To all the shills that keep celebrating paper handing at this pathetic 276$. How's life like while sucking at Kenny G boys nipple?

To all the others: don't fall for this feel good FUD. The shills play with your mind. They spread doubt and let you question yourself if you are a good or bad person for being greedy now that the Hedgies are bleeding and full of fear. You are on the winning side. Stay strong, stay mercy less. The squeeze is not squoze yet. The MOASS will shift the balance of power and let us do good for our local community's and raise more humanitary funds than the 1% have ever did.

 I talk about saving starving children in Yemen, funding schools for the poor, saving gorilla's, bonobos and whales. What ever you want, if it's a local social space for the ones struggling with life or if it's just paying back your depts. This only works if we hold and WE call the price.

FUD spreading Shillingbots will spread doubt. It is good for the real apes who get adopted. But we are apes too and we can only free ourselves by holding and not selling.

Hodl! The squeeze will take weeks and will peak harder than your mom's nipples after breastfeeding you. Hodl and when you hear news of hedgies going bust, everything going to shit, hold even harder because as long as cnbc and others can cry, they are still alive.

Hear me out...

Setting dates on when things will happen is a TERRIBLE idea...

When someone sets a date and says for instance “march 19th is the squeeze date” it lets the HEDGE FUNDS know that we have our hopes up for that specific date so.... they will obviously push it back farther and delay it to make everyone get discouraged, make people paper handedly sell, and then start conflicts between people with seriously great DD and say its all bullshit.

Mr pixel, i love what you do, i love your DD. I think its genius and your killing it(doing amazing), but PLEASE stop setting dates for squeezes and events

For instance Mr Pixel said that Friday(today) there is a very high chance at a gamma squeeze.. the hedge funds saw how hyped up everyone was for this massive squeeze today that never happened.. why is that? Because the hedge funds purposely pushed it back to DISCOURAGE YOU and make you think all this DD is bullshit!!!!!!! 

Ill tell you what, if there was no date and everyone just said the “squeeze is coming, just hold on” i bet that yesterday and today would have went A LOT differently, its these hedge funds trying to destroy us. 

The more dates we set, the farther back the squeeze goes, STOP SETTING DATES, and maybe the apes can  catch these bastards red handed and hit them with a surprise attack!!!! 

I fully support what all of you do with your God tier DD and i give you the most props for taking the time out of your day to do the work and make a post to share it!!! But please just stop with the date setting, its only setting the squeeze back farther and farther.

I love you all, please take this as a positive outlook to the future, the squeeze is on its way and will be here soon, just hang in there and hold on tight because a rocket flight to the moon isnt a smooth ride🚀💎🙌🏻



Tl:DR - stop setting dates, hedge funds see that and purposely use manipulation to hold the squeeze off to discourage the apes! Spread the word, there is alot of great guys out there with phenomenal DD just stop adding dates!!! Hold on tight were in for the ride of our life time!🚀🚀🚀

Because I was getting pinged I thought of instead of replying to each and every one of those I'd just post this. I will however keep it short, as I'm not feeling well I just want to go back to bed.

Now some people seem to have a problem with this particular comment.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhfxbm/official\_ama\_alexis\_goldstein\_friday\_april\_2\_11/gt5g8qe/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhfxbm/official_ama_alexis_goldstein_friday_april_2_11/gt5g8qe/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

So before we have some people paperhand lets look at some logical reasons as to why this may have been her response.

Liability

If she said ""yes 100% will happen"" what do you think would happen? she is a financial expert and the moment she would say something like that you have 2 different plays

  
1) she is a catalyst, and the firms would go after her

2) she would say it and it and it wont happen in the foreseeable future, and all the people invested in GME after she said it would happen could sue her for misleading people.

3) people would hear a financial expert say this and they would fomo in and cause a fomo wave never seen before.

4) After GME I don't think we would ever see a situation like this ever again, lots of people said this is a once in a lifetime event, and I think they are right.

If you look back on the 2008 crash what did you think happened to Michael Burry? he was pestered for years by the SEC and FBI, as was everyone else who foresaw that happen. so can you think of a reason why both Mr. Kelleher and Ms. Goldstein may be careful with the words they use and write? 

Because I sure as hell can.

Now like she said, she doesn't have a crystal ball, no one has, no one can say what the outcome will be or how high etc.

Do I still believe in the squeeze? hell yeah I do.

&#x200B;

Even if a person comes here and voices an opinion that is not in line with the rest you still respect them, this is not an echo chamber we have always welcomed DD and counter DD.   
But please take in mind all the DD that has been released since early February, if you get FUD because one person is not sure about something while having DD that says it is, there is a simple cure for that.

Go and do DD.

Check the numbers and data for yourself, form your own opinion.

And remember, be nice to one and other, for the love of god, you can disagree on things but do so as adults.

&#x200B;

not financial advice yada yada, my reactions will most likely be tomorrow at the earliest.

Edit:
I forgot to mention an important point, again not feeling well atm so I just forgot at the time of writing but felt it needed to be said.

It could also be that ms Goldstein’s personally does not believe in the squeeze, and that is totally fine, again all opinions are welcome here.
By having different opinions we can get a discourse which can lead to new ideas and bring different perspectives. Anyone’s opinions on this situation can vary, and in turn we should respect those opinions.

The difference lies with how those opinions are presented, someone who is obviously trolling or shil/bot is very different to me then someone who puts forth a decent opinion or argument.

I hope everyone is well and has a great weekend!",2021-04-02 20:03:47

Endgame is upon us and we all know it. I feel like there isn’t much of a point in me giving my price predictions anymore, because if you’ve been reading the DD, we all know some MASSIVE FUCKING SHIT is about to go down!!! 

Salutations apes, u/possibly6 here with your price levels to watch tomorrow, 3/19. Remember this ain’t no mothafuckin financial advice hoe, I Ape am an.

I received a few messages from people yesterday asking if I was going to post as usual, I’m sorry but (turns out I have Covid lol) I wasn’t feelin it. I’m actually feeling a lot better today, so I guess there’s a light at the end of the tunnel.

I’ll keep the DD brief. Look at this 1hr view of GME.

[yummy colorful crayons](https://preview.redd.it/xayv5yeucvn61.png?width=2878&format=png&auto=webp&s=7de5a8970e5eb0984102a33f6bb4ac94a16eb4e5)

Look at the light blue support and resistance lines. The patterns here are known as a symmetrical triangle and a descending channel. Basically, price has bounced around off these levels, as you can visualize above.

Something to note, if you didn't see my last [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6qx4b/the_cup_and_handle_pattern_explained_for_dummies/), the very small green box underneath the purple line is a gap up from March 8th. There is **VERY STRONG SUPPORT**  at the 172 level (red line above the purple line.)

Symmetrical triangles can break in either direction (see below)

https://preview.redd.it/te0nv6h1evn61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=21902f3e62130c3c0fdf7a55022b05825f15cb52

I would LOVE to see the breakout to the upside, though I suspect tomorrow will be a last-ditch effort by the shorties to demoralize retailers and try to get people to sell (spoiler alert: it won't work).

idk about you, but I have an addiction to buying GME shares. Everyday the squeeze is not squoze, I buy at least 1 share.

That being said, I LOVE buying my favorite stock for CHEAP, so the levels that I will be watching tomorrow to average up (I first started accumulating at 16 hehe) are **187-190** (light blue line), **172**, **157** (bottom of big green box) and I have a hail Mary buy order for **150**.

[BLUE = 187-190    RED = 172    BOTTOM OF BIG GREEN BOX: 157     PURPLE\/GREEN=140](https://preview.redd.it/1jsavonyhvn61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=b52aad12338a5b1ecc3295ccf49756309eb1cdef)

This rocket is about to take off, and idk about you, but **IM JACKED TO THE FUCKING TITS**

[MACD and TTM Squeeze look Bullish on the 4hr](https://preview.redd.it/od10e20rivn61.png?width=2880&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbef8a7209f6b25e2d94da8669710024b4b60ff3)

I would love to see us liftoff tomorrow, but I don't like putting dates on things as it just leads to disappointment should it not happen on said date. nonetheless, payday is coming soon. I can feel it. I've never seen this community so excited, even when GME has been having a down week.

TLDR: THE SQUEEZE IS IMMINENT! I suspect tomorrow shorts will play dirty, and I expect a crazy fucking volatile day due to quad witching. Buy and **HODL!!!** Support levels to watch tomorrow are **187, 172, 157,** and if shit gets really crazy, **140.** In all honesty I'll be buying throughout the day cause price literally doesn't matter as of now.

And Wallstreet knows this.",1617107018.0,"It feels like everyone on Wallstreet is getting ready for something big. The [NSCC filing today](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mg4o2q/nscc_filing_today_this_is_actually_insane/) and new DTCC rules, the liquidation Archegos, and multi-billion dollar loss of Nomura, etc.

They're getting ready for something much bigger than the MOASS. There is a high possibility that the MOASS will trigger a market crash like what was seen in 2008. Shitadel is a huge HF and when they and others get margin called, Wallstreet loses some of their biggest market makers. It's like when Lehman went out of business, but Citadel in this case. Everyone is covering their ass for when the inevitable comes, but they need time to do that. They have access to Bloomberg terminals too, and they all know the negative beta is -23, and I guarantee you their senior partners are having meetings about this right now.

So my theory: the whales are keeping a lid on GME to buy time to prepare. If it blows now, people over-leveraged in unrelated areas go tits up (like Archegos), and FEDs come in and people start playing blame games, blah blah blah. If it's 2008 and you knew Lehman was going bankrupt next month, wouldn't you buy time to cover your ass too? **They're buying time** to move their positions, and for NSCC to file their new rules, (not to mention, Kenny G knows this, and tried to put the blame on retail in his latest interview).

Something is coming. Either GME will be the catalyst for a market crash, or a market crash will be the catalyst for GME.

- - - - - - 

I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: **We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.** Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1. Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.

2. Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.

3. Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

4. Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

5. At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

6. Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

7. The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: **The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.**  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital.  They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said **a small sell limit order executed at $2600 for him.**  Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?  It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to [this remarkable (if infuriating) interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM) where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  **DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""?** Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie *Snowpiercer*?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

**TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.**  

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them.  They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating.  They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.",2021-01-29 01:10:59

And no, it’s not China. It’s a homegrown threat that everyone has been afraid to talk about. 

Until now. 

That fear has now turned into rage.

Hordes of new retail investors are banding together to take on Wall Street.  They are not willing to sit back and watch naked short sellers, funded by big banks, manipulate stocks, harm companies, and fleece shareholders. 

The battle that launched this week over GameStop between retail investors and Wall Street-backed naked short sellers is the beginning of a war that could change everything.  

It’s a global problem, but it poses the greatest threat to Canadian capital markets, where naked short selling—the process of selling shares you don’t own, thereby creating counterfeit or ‘phantom’ shares—survives and remains under the regulatory radar because Broker-Dealers do not have to report failing trades until they exceed 10 days.  

This is an egregious act against capital markets, and it’s caused billions of dollars in damage. 

Make no mistake about the enormity of this threat: Both foreign and domestic schemers have attacked Canada in an effort to bring down the stock prices of its publicly listed companies. 

In Canada alone, hundreds of billions of dollars have been vaporized from pension funds and regular, everyday Canadians because of this, according to Texas-based lawyer James W. Christian. Christian and his firm [Christian Smith & Jewell LLP](http://www.csj-law.com/index.html) are heavy hitters in litigation related to stock manipulation and have prosecuted over 20 cases involving naked short selling and spoofing in the last 20 years.  

*“Hundreds of billions have been stolen from everyday Canadians and Americans and pension funds alike, and this has jeopardized the integrity of Canada’s capital markets and the integral process of capital creation for entrepreneurs and job creation for the economy,”* Christian told Oilprice.com.

**The Dangerous Naked Short-Selling MO**

In order to \[legally\] sell a stock short, traders must first locate and secure a borrow against the shares they intend to sell. A broker who enters such a trade must have assurance that his client will make settlement.  

While “long” sales mean the seller owns the stock, short sales can be either [“covered” or “naked”](https://www.mcmillan.ca/Short-Selling-in-Canada-Regulations-are-Weak-and-a-New-Path-Forward-is-Needed-to-Reduce?utm_source=Mondaq&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=LinkedIn-integration). A *covered short* means that the short seller has already “borrowed” or has located or arranged to borrow the shares when the short sale is made. Whereas, a *naked short* means the short seller is selling shares it doesn’t own and has made no arrangements to buy. The seller cannot cover or “settle” in this instance, which means they are selling “ghost” or “phantom” shares that simply do not exist without their action.

When you have the ability to sell an unlimited number of non-existent phantom shares in a publicly-traded company, you then have the power to destroy and manipulate the share price at your own will. 

And big banks and financial institutions are turning a blind eye to some of the accounts that routinely participate in these illegal transactions because of the large fees they collect from them. These institutions are actively facilitating the destruction of shareholder value in return for short term windfalls in the form of trading fees. They are a major part of the problem and are complicit in aiding these accounts to create counterfeit shares. 

The funds behind this are hyper sophisticated and know all the rules and tricks needed to exploit the regulators to buy themselves time to cover their short positions. According to multiple accounts from traders, lawyers, and businesses who have become victims of the worst of the worst in this game, short-sellers sometimes manage to stay naked for months on end, in clear violation of even the most relaxed securities laws. 

The short-sellers and funds who participate in this manipulation almost always finance undisclosed “short reports” which they research & prepare in advance, before paying well-known short-selling groups to publish and market their reports (often without any form of disclosure) to broad audiences in order to further push the stock down artificially. There’s no doubt that these reports are intended to create maximum fear amongst retail investors and to push them to sell their shares as quickly as possible. 

That is market manipulation. Plain and simple. 

Their MO is to short weak, vulnerable companies by putting out negative reports that drive down their share price as much as possible. This ensures that the shorted company in question no longer has the ability to obtain financing, putting them at the mercy of the same funds that were just shorting them. After cratering the shorted company's share price, the funds then start offering these companies financing usually through convertibles with a warrant attachment as a hedge (or potential future cover) against their short; and the companies take the offers because they have no choice left. Rinse and Repeat.

In addition to the foregoing madness, brokers are often complicit in these sorts of crimes through their booking of client shares as “long” when they are in fact “short”. This is where the practice moves from a regulatory gray area to conduct worthy of prison time.  

Naked short selling was officially labeled illegal in the U.S. and Europe after the 2008/2009 financial crisis. 

Making it illegal didn’t stop it from happening, however, because some of the more creative traders have discovered convenient gaps between paper and electronic trading systems, and they have taken advantage of those gaps to short stocks. 

Still, it gets even more sinister.  

According to Christian, “global working groups” coordinate their attacks on specifically targeted companies in a “Mafia-like” strategy. 

Journalists are paid off, along with social media influencers and third-party research houses that are funded by what amounts to a conspiracy. Together, they collaborate to spread lies and negative narratives to destroy a stock. 

At its most illegal, there is an insider-trading element that should enrage regulators. The MO is to infiltrate a company through disgruntled insiders or lawyers close to the company. These sources are used to obtain insider information that is then leaked to damage the company. 

Often, these illegal transactions involve paying off “informants”, journalists, influencers, and “researchers” are difficult to trace because they are made from offshore accounts that are shut down once the deed is done. 

Likewise, the “shorts” disguised as longs can be difficult to trace when the perpetrators have direct market access to trading systems. These trades are usually undetected until the trades fail or miss settlement.  At that point, the account will move the position to another broker-dealer and start the process all over again. 

The collusion widens when brokers and financial institutions become complicit in purposefully mislabeling “shorts” as “longs”, sweeping the illegal transactions under the rug and off of regulatory radar. 

“Spoofing” and “layering” have also become pervasive techniques to avoid regulator attention. Spoofing, as the name suggests, involves short sellers creating fake selling pressure on their targeted stocks to drive prices lower. They accomplish this by submitting fake offerings in “layers” at different prices to create a mirage. 

Finally, these bad actors manage to skirt the settlement system, which is supposed to “clear” on what is called a [T+2 basis](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-do-t1-t2-and-t3-mean/). That means that any failed trades must be bought or dealt with within 3 days. In other words, if you buy on Monday (your “T” or transaction day), it has to be settled by Wednesday. 

Unfortunately, Canadian regulators have a hard time keeping up with this system, and failed trades are often left outstanding for much longer periods than T+2. These failing trades are constantly being traded to reset the settlement clock and move the failing trade to the back of the line. The failures of a centralized system…

According to Christian, it can be T+12 days before a failed trade is even brought to the attention of the IIROC (the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada)…

**Prime Brokers and Banks are Complicit**

This is one of Wall Street’s biggest profit center and fines levied against them are merely a minor cost of doing business. 

Some banks are getting rich off of these naked short sellers. The profits off this kind of lending are tantalizing, indeed. Brokers are lending stocks they don’t own for massive profit and sizable bonuses. 

This layer of what many have now called a “criminal organization” is the toughest for regulators to deal with, regardless of the illegal nature of these activities. 

Prime brokers lend cash account shares that are absolutely not allowed to be lent. They lend them to short-sellers in order to facilitate them in settling their naked shorts. 

It’s not that the regulators are in the dark on this. They are, in fact, handing out fines, left and right—both for illegal lending and for mismarking “shorts” and “longs” to evade regulatory scrutiny. The problem is that these fines pale in comparison to the profits earned through these activities. 

And banks in Canada in particular are basically writing the rules themselves, recently making it easier (and legal) to lend out cash account shares.

Nor do law firms have clean hands. They help short sellers bankrupt targeted companies through court proceedings, a process that eventually leads to the disappearance of evidence of naked shorts on the bank books.

“How much has been stolen through this fraudulent system globally is anyone’s guess,” says Christian, “but the number begins with a ‘T’ (trillions).”

The list of fines for enabling and engaging in manipulative activity that destroys companies’ stock prices may seem to carry big numbers from the retail investor’s perspective, but they are not even close to being significant enough to deter such actions:

\- The SEC charged Citigroup’s principal U.S. broker-deal subsidiary in 2011 with misleading investors about a $1 billion collateralized debt obligation (CDO) tied to the U.S. housing market. Citigroup had bet against investors as the housing market showed signs of distress. The CDO defaulted only months later, causing severe losses for investors and a profit of $160 million (just in fees and trading profits). Citigroup paid [$285 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-214.htm) to settle these SEC charges.

\- In 2016, Goldman, Sachs & Co. agreed to pay [$15 million](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html) to settle SEC charges that its securities lending practices violated federal regulations. To wit: The SEC found that Goldman Sachs was mismarking logs and allowed customers to engage in short selling without determining whether the securities could reasonably be borrowed at settlement.

\- In 2013, a Charles Schwab subsidiary was found liable by the SEC for a naked short-selling scheme and fined [$8.2 million](https://www.law360.com/articles/744936/sec-mulls-schwab-unit-s-naked-short-sale-sanction-appeal).

\- The SEC charged two Merrill Lynch entities in 2015 with using “inaccurate data in the course of executing short sale orders”, fining them $11 million.

\- And most recently, Canadian Cormark Securities Inc and two others came under the SEC’s radar. On December 21, SEC instituted [cease-and-desist orders](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2020/34-90740.pdf) against Cormark. It also settled charges against Cormark and two other Canada-based broker deals for “providing incorrect order-making information that caused an executing broker’s repeated violations of Regulation SHO”. According to the SEC, Cormark and ITG Canada caused more than 200 sale orders from a single hedge fund, to the tune of more than $660 million between August 2016 and October 2017, to be mismarked as “long” when they were, in fact, “short”—a clear violation of Regulation SHO. Cormark agreed to pay a [penalty of $800,000](https://www.sec.gov/enforce/34-90740-s), while ITG Canada—one of the other broker-dealers charged—agreed to pay a penalty of $200,000. Charging and fining Cormark is only the tip of the iceberg. The real question is on whose behalf was Cormark making the naked short sells?

\- In August 2020, Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank) was fined [$127 million](https://www.wsj.com/articles/scotiabank-fined-127-million-for-price-manipulation-false-statements-11597877100) over civil and criminal allegations in connection with its role in a massive price-manipulation scheme.

According to one Toronto-based Canadian trader who spoke to Oilprice.com on condition of anonymity, *“traders are the gatekeeper for the capital markets and they’re not doing a very good job because it’s lucrative to turn a blind eye.”* This game is set to end in the near future, and it is only a matter of time.

*“These traders are breaking a variety of regulations, and they are taking this risk on because of the size of the account,”* he said. *“They have a responsibility to turn these trades down. Whoever is doing this is breaking regulations \[for the short seller\] and they know he is not going to be able to make a settlement. As a gatekeeper, it is their regulatory responsibility to turn these trades away. Instead, they are breaking the law willfully and with full knowledge of what they are doing.”*

*“If you control the settlement system, you can do whatever you want,”* the source said. *“The compliance officers have no teeth because the banks are making big money. They over-lend the stocks; they lend from cash account shares to cover some of these fails … for instance, if there are 20 million shares they sold ‘long’, they can cover by borrowing from cash account shares.”*

**The Naked Truth**

In what he calls our “ominous financial reality”, Tom C.W. Lin, attorney at law, details how “millions of dollars can vanish in seconds, rogue actors can halt trading of billion-dollar companies, and trillion-dollar financial markets can be distorted with a simple click or a few lines of code”.

Every investor and every institution is at risk, writes Lin.  

The naked truth is this: Investors stand no chance in the face of naked short sellers. It’s a game rigged in the favor of a sophisticated short cartel and Wall Street giants. 

Now, with online trading making it easier to democratize trading, there are calls for regulators to make moves against these bad actors to ensure that North America’s capital markets remain protected, and retail investors are treated fairly. 

The recent GameStop saga is retail fighting back against the shorting powers, and it's a wonderful thing to see - but is it a futile punch or the start of something bigger? The positive take away from the events the past week is that the term “short selling” has been introduced to the public and will surely gather more scrutiny.

Washington is gearing up to get involved. That means that we can expect the full power of Washington, not just the regulators, to be thrown behind protecting the retail investors from insidious short sellers and the bankers and prime brokers who are profiting beyond belief from these manipulative schemes. 

The pressure is mounting in Canada, too, where laxer rules have been a huge boon for manipulators. The US short cartel has preyed upon the Canadian markets for decades as they know the regulators rarely take action. It is truly the wild west.

Just over a year ago, [McMillan published](https://www.mcmillan.ca/Short-Selling-in-Canada-Regulations-are-Weak-and-a-New-Path-Forward-is-Needed-to-Reduce?utm_source=Mondaq&utm_medium=syndication&utm_campaign=LinkedIn-integration) a lengthy report on the issue from the Canadian perspective, concluding that there are significant weaknesses in the regulatory regime. 

While covered short-selling itself has undeniable benefits in providing liquidity and facilitating price discovery, and while the Canadian regulators’ hands-off approach has attracted many people to its capital markets, there are significant weaknesses that threaten to bring the whole house of cards down. 

McMillan also noted that “the number of short campaigns in Canada is utterly disproportionate to the size of our capital markets when compared to the United States, the European Union, and Australia”. 

Taking Wall Street’s side in this battle, [Bloomberg](https://blinks.bloomberg.com/news/stories/QNLPZ6T0G1KW) notes that Wall Street has survived “numerous other attacks” over the centuries, “but the GameStop uprising could mark the end of an era for the public short”, suggesting that these actors are “long-vilified folks who try to root out corporate wrongdoing”. 

Bloomberg even attempts to victimize Andrew Left’s Citron Research, which—amid all the chaos—has just announced that it has exited the short-selling game after two decades. 

Nothing could be further from the truth. Short sellers, particularly the naked variety, are not helping police the markets and route out bad companies, as Bloomberg suggests. **Naked short sellers are not motivated by moral and ethical reasons, but by profit alone.** They attack good, but weak and vulnerable companies. **They are not the saviors of capital markets, but the destroyers.** Andrew Left may be a “casualty”, but he is not a victim. Nor likely are the hedge funds with whom he has been working. 

[In a petition](https://blogactionday.change.org/p/u-s-securities-and-exchange-commission-sec-enforcement-to-investigate-andrew-left-of-citron-research?original_footer_petition_id=23189747&algorithm=promoted&source_location=petition_footer&grid_position=3&pt=AVBldGl0aW9uAAff1wAAAAAAYAoOkIbS1NoyZmQyYjJmNQ%3D%3D) initiated by Change.org, the petitioners urge the SEC and FINRA to investigate Left and Citron Research, noting: “While information Citron Research publishes are carefully selected and distributed in ways that do not break the law at first sight, the SEC and FINRA have overlooked the fact that Left and Citron gains are a result of distributing catalysts in an anticipation of substantial price changes due to public response in either panic, encouragement, or simply a catalyst action wave ride. Their job as a company is to create the most amount of panic shortly after taking a trading position so they and their clients can make the most amount of financial gains at the expense of regular investors.”

On January 25th, the [Capital Markets Modernization Taskforce](https://savecanadianmining.com/save-canadian-mining-congratulates-ontarios-capital-markets-modernization-taskforce-on-addressing-predatory-short-selling-in-final-report/) published its final report for Ontario’s Minister of Finance, noting that while naked short selling has been illegal in the United States since 2008, it remains a legal loophole in Canada. The task force is recommending that the Ministry ban this practice that allows for the short-selling of tradable assets without first borrowing the security. 

The National Coalition Against Naked Short Selling - Failing to Deliver Securities (NCANS), which takes pains to emphasize that is not in any way against short-selling, notes: “Naked short-selling transfers the risk exposure and the hedging expense of the derivatives market makers onto the backs of equity investors, without any corresponding benefit to them. This is fundamentally unfair, and must stop.”

Across North America, the issue is about to reach a fever pitch over GameStop. For once, regular retail investors have a voice to use against Wall Street. And for once, Washington appears to be listening. The House and Senate both have [hearings scheduled](https://nypost.com/2021/01/28/congress-announces-hearings-on-reddit-fueled-gamestop-trading/) over the GameStop saga. 

Paradoxically, the same company that basically started the retail investor coup—zero-fee trading app Robinhood—is now under fire for pulling the rug out from under the same democratic movement. 

After retail investors joined forces against Wall Street short-sellers to push GameStop stock from $20 to a high of over $480 in less than a week, Robinhood made the very unpopular move of instituting [a ban on buying](https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/01/28/gamestop-stocks-brokerages-limit-trading-sparking-outcry/) for retail investors. Under the rules, Wall Street could still buy and sell, but retail investors could only sell. This new band of investors—which includes pretty much all of Robinhood’s clientele—are up in arms, with customers now suing. They won’t go away, and they have Washington’s ear … and Twitter and Reddit’s social media power. This is shaping up to be an uprising.

What happens with GameStop next could end up dictating a new form of capital markets democracy that levels the playing field and punishes the Mafia-like elements of Wall Street that have been fleecing investors and destroying companies for years. 

Retail investors want to clean up capital markets, and they just might be powerful enough to do it now. That’s a serious wake-up call for both naked short sellers and the investing public.

Viva la Revolucion.

Edit 2: I posted it on r/Stocks and receive this response:Let me say this, I was a broker from \~1988-2002 and in the '90s on Naked Shorts was an issue. I was on a conference call talking to regulators (along with \~30 other folks) debating the pros and cons, even though it probably least understood Shorting is essential for the markets to work correctly, however, Naked Shorting is a huge threat to individual cos., market makers, and the brokerage firms, very much on the discount brokers. With wirehouses they will find a borrow before they'll execute a short, in fact at one time for several years you had to call stock loan, make sure shares were available, and put the Auth # given to you by stock loan on the ticket!! Then with discount brokers who had a skeleton back office you place a trade and the Short Sale it's immediately filled and nobody sees if there are borrows available now or when the trade was placed. As much as so many dislike the BIG FIRMS this is primarily a disc. firm issue. On that call, the regulators said ""we'll keep a close eye (via Stock Watch) and as we see naked shorts we'll call and make sure they have shares to borrow. Over the next 10+ years, I've never spoken to anyone that had heard from the SEC ever!!

# TL:DR

So yesterday, March31, the weird deep ITM call options started happening again. I jumped down the rabbit hole and found what I believe are 44million obfuscated shorts, and you can read more about that here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhv22h/the\_si\_is\_fake\_i\_found\_44000000\_million\_shorts/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhv22h/the_si_is_fake_i_found_44000000_million_shorts/)

There you will find yesterday's data, historical data, and the SEC publication that explains what mechanism is likely taking place here.

# Why is this huge?

After publishing yesterday's findings, my biggest worry was nothing happening today. Then, my theory would have been built on a blip. However, we saw second consecutive trading day with this activity, and the activity doubled.

So I believe this lends support to these two hypotheses:

1. This activity for one reason or another IS cyclical
2. The cycles ARE getting tighter and more brutal

# April 1st Deep ITM Call 'Anomalies'

Today April 1st, at 1:58:05pm, 1:22:50 pm, 1:22:52pm, and 3:29:24pm another round of deep ITM call 'anomalies' took place. This is a repeat and increase of what we saw at 1:58pm yesterday, when $52m+ was ""spent"" in these anomalies. 303,900 shares or so were conjured in this way. Today, that value was much higher.

# Altogether: 

# We are in the second day of the deep call activity cycle

# April 1 - 10335 contracts - 1,033,500 shares laundered, FTDs reset, whatever you wanna call it. 

# 3x as much as yesterday! Good on ya Ken!

Turns out you can actually search the SEC's vast archive of 10-K filings for specific phrases. Let's see just how common this language is, shall we? First, the actual excerpt from the 10K filing in its entirety:

&#x200B;

>***The market price of our Class A Common Stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control.***  
>  
>Stock markets in general and our stock price in particular have recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies and our company. For example, on January 28, 2021, our Class A Common Stock experienced an intra-day trading high of $483.00 per share and a low of $112.25 per share. In addition, from January 11, 2021 to March 17, 2021, the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the NYSE ranged from as low as $19.94 to as high as $347.51 and daily trading volume ranged from approximately 7,060,000 to 197,200,000 shares. During this time, we have not experienced any material changes in our financial condition or results of operations that would explain such price volatility or trading volume. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock. In particular, a large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which has put and may continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A Common Stock, further influencing volatility in its market price. Additionally, these and other external factors have caused and may continue to cause the market price and demand for our Class A Common Stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent our stockholders from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our Class A Common Stock.  
>  
>***A “short squeeze” due to a sudden increase in demand for shares of our Class A Common Stock that largely exceeds supply has led to, and may continue to lead to, extreme price volatility in shares of our Class A Common Stock.***  
>  
>Investors may purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock to hedge existing exposure or to speculate on the price of our Class A Common Stock. Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of shares of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as a “short squeeze.”  
>  
>A large proportion of our Class A Common Stock has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood that our Class A Common Stock will be the target of a short squeeze. A short squeeze has led and could continue to lead to volatile price movements in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions, the price of our Class A Common Stock may rapidly decline. Stockholders that purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock during a short squeeze may lose a significant portion of their investment.  
>  
>***Future sales of a substantial amount of our Class A Common Stock in the public markets by our insiders, or the perception that these sales may occur, may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.***  
>  
>Our employees, directors and officers, and their affiliates, hold substantial amounts of shares of our Class A Common Stock. Sales of a substantial number of such shares by these stockholders, or the perception that such sales will occur, may cause the market price of our Class A Common Stock to decline.

367,What is WRONG about the $2456 per share theory? And why $600k is achievable.,1622981944.0,"What everyone needs to understand is this...we are NOT seeing the whole picture!  It's the iceberg image.  We are only getting the tip of it that sticks out of water because that's all that is publicly reported.  The other 80% of the iceberg is underwater and is NOT reported to us.

This announcement we are ALLLLLL waiting on will reveal the truth about the 80% that is NOT being reported publicly.  

We DO KNOW we have at least 130 million FTD's, which is about 30% of the entire float.  

We also DO KNOW that we own AT LEAST 90% of the float, which is based ONLY on the 20% of info being reported.

We speculate that there are at least 3 billion and possibly as many as 10 billion NAKED SHORTED shares (Fake/synthetic).  That is where things get interesting because people MUST go to jail over this and NEW LAWS MUST be implemented.

So based on the info above that gives a $2485 per share target...that is ONLY going by what we DO KNOW publicly.  🤣🤣🤣🤣 Hence my bear poop response to Joe's question.  They are going off a reported short interest of roughly 100 Million shares, which we ALLL KNOW is total, utter and complete hogwash!  

So if they surmise a share price of $2485.60 based on 100 million shares short, and there turns out to be 3 billion shares short, then we will figure it as follows: 

3 billion / 100 million = 30 x $2485.60 = $74,568 per share.  

Furthermore, we can figure that it is $24,856 per share additional per 1 billion shares short. 

4 billion short = $99,424 per share
5 billion short = $124,280 per share
6 billion short = $149,145 per share
7 billion short = $174,001 per share
8 billion short = $198,857 per share

Well it's not going to be linear that's for sure. (It won't go straight up to $600k)

For trading in general, I follow the 3 day run rule on major moves.

A stock will take off and Run 3 days straight. 

On the 4th day it gaps up or opens flat then pushes a little higher, then the bottom falls out. 

I figure this may be how it plays out once the news comes out and they shake it up along the way, but I figure the 4th day is sell-off day.  Could be the 3rd though 🤷🏻‍♂️

I figure we may see between $250 - $500 by next Friday. 

We've never been here before so it's anyone's guess. 

There will be a continual changeover of shareholders. Those of us holding since Jan/Feb are the apes or strongest hands because we've held since $14 and the drop back to $7, back up to $15 then back down to $8.  Now that we are up 300% plus we are not fazed by the erratic movements. We know the target is at least $600k per share. 

The ones that have come in during the last week are the weakest, until the next set come in after finally seeing action or hearing about it for the 1st time. So those buying now between $30-$60 may get shaken out on the next round of volatility when we hit $100 and it gets shaken down to $50.  

When it runs back up after shaking them out, they will have a psychological block and not want to pay higher than they got kicked out at. They will wait for a dip that never comes. 

They start 😭😭😭 as it runs higher and higher and they can't pull the trigger to get back in. 

It will be BYE BYE PAPERHANDS. 

Then deeper pockets will be entering and buying in the $100-$300 range and may get shaken out when it hits $500 and drops back then runs back to $500.  They will be happy to see $500 again and duck out, likely not to return.

They will  be 😖😠😖😠 that they didn't get in sooner and hold.  It will be BYE BYE DEEPER POCKETS! 

Once we reach $1k, it will be a masterful game of psychological war. They will shake it hundreds of dollars a day and try to shake out the apes.  This will reveal who really is an ape. 

$1K could come within 10-14 days of the announcement or sooner. I don't know, but it will be epic to watch.  

Beyond $1k to $2k or higher will like extend beyond 30 days and up to 3 months because it will be a back and forth battle to shake out any shares possible. The shorts will continue to pay interest daily. 

If the apes that are diamond handed own between 200-300% of the float they will frustrate the shorts because they refuse to sell for less than $600k and eventually it will pop like a rocket.  The clearinghouse will be the only thing to push it to that level because there will likely be zero buyers to bid it up beyond a certain point.

The only thing that will seal the deal for a quicker MOASS would be the SEC announcing a lawsuit against firms who have broken the laws and purposely sought to harm AMC and their shareholders.",2021-06-06 05:19:04,😆,1619134636.0,,2021-04-22 16:37:16,367,"WardenElite is KILLING it live right now - TRIPPLE A MUST WATCH !

Let uncle Holstynator come by and put some wrinkles on this shiny brain of yours.

&#x200B;

I am very, very tired of you guys throwing around low-ass numbers, occasionally mentioning a 100k, 500k or 1MM to farm karma, but you're probably the same people who jump of the rocket before we even left our gravitational field.

&#x200B;

Something you have to understand. Eventually, the shorts HAVE to cover.

&#x200B;

It doesn't matter if the covering liquidates ONE of the hedgefunds.

&#x200B;

It doesn't even matter if the covering liquidates ALL of them. EVERY share will have to be bought back, the only thing missing from the equation is: What is YOUR price?

No, really. This is it. Name your price, any price. It literally is that simple.

&#x200B;

You may not have understood this yet, just like no one understood how valuable the shiny internet coin with a B was ten years ago - but what you are holding is potentially the single greatest asset in the history of mankind, one that can shift the international market as a whole, this is bigger than ANY of you can even FATHOM.

&#x200B;

A million is A LOT of money to a lot of you, but Kenny G made a couple of those every day during the pandemic. Think it's a lot for him?

&#x200B;

Think Shitadel is the ONLY hedgefund invested? Nah, my monke friend. We have probably 7-10 funds shorting GME HEAVILY, and who knows how much money these fucks really have, I don't trust their self-published reports.

&#x200B;

So, a reminder for every single one of you: This is NOT a once in a lifetime event. *This is a one time event.* You're witnessing the big bang of the financial sector, the big deluge of money, THIS, ladies and gentlemen, will break every wall and dimension known to mankind.

&#x200B;

You're a 16 year old chimp with ONE share?? This share CAN go for five million.

&#x200B;

You're a 25 year old college student with 10 shares? Welcome to the 0.1%, my friend, because you can net yourself up to 50MM$.

You're a 40 year old cuck and king fucking kong with 100+ shares? Well hello there, you'll drown in pussy (or dick, let's be respectable) when this is over.

&#x200B;

TL; DR: ANY price is the RIGHT price. NO price is a meme. HOLD, BUY, HOLD and strap into this rocket that will send you not into the stratosphere, not out of the galaxy, but to a different dimension where tendies grow on trees and the rivers are banana milk.

Disclaimer:  I am not a financial advisor. Everything below is pure speculation and informational. Each person must do their own due diligence and make decisions based on that.  

I've been involved in trading for 23 years and have had many ups and downs and witnessed many things so I wish to lend my experience to this current situation. 

As a CEO of a company preparing to issue shares to initial investors in the coming months, then go public in a few years, I will tell you how irritating it is for me to watch along with the apes (my fellow investors), the dirty, underhanded, blatant, in our face manipulation that is taking place against AMC specifically! 

Ape is a new term coined for those apparent know-nothings that are helping to reveal the deep corruption that exists on Wallstreet and hand these suits their behind on a silver platter.  

You see, a group of Hedge funds decided that AMC was going to go bankrupt so they shorted the stock. That means they didn't own shares, instead, they borrowed them from shareholders like me and sold them into the market.  

Shorting is a useful tool to keep companies in check if they are lying about the numbers, but if overdone, it can negatively affect a company and it's investors.  Shorting should be kept in check, and there are rules to do so, but they are seemingly ignored and broken regularly, especially with AMC. 

Then the Hedge Fund sent out reps to do interviews and paid TV talking heads to begin bashing the stock and claiming it was going to $0.  Crookedness, right?   

In the case of AMC, they have sold all the shares available in the market that were owned by investors. They pay interest daily on the shares they short. 

PLUS, on top of that, they sold much more.  They entered what's called 'naked short' territory...in a BIG way! 

Speculators put the amount between 100% - 1000% over the amount of shares the company even has.  Pure crookedness, right? 

They do pay interest and have to cover their position within a certain time frame or It's called a fail to deliver (FTD).  

The problem is that they don't care and the punishment is not strong enough to deter this practice. They may make $20 million on their crooked, lying, manipulative moves, but only get fined $5 million.  Well what's to stop the practice if they still come out ahead? 

The regulators continue to allow it, which means they don't care or are bought off.  Congress will hold hearings which is nothing more than a dog and pony show.  The politicians have public positions and private positions.  They say one thing in front of the camera but believe something else behind closed doors.  It's all about the $.  It will take millions of people blowing up their phone lines and emails demanding they do their job! 

In AMC's case, the company has roughly 450 million shares that they chose to go with when the set the company up, or increased to over time.  Of that 450, there are supposed to be roughly 418 million shares in the market that is in the hands of institutions or personal investors. 

When the company does well and makes a profit, the value of the shares go up and shareholders can get a dividend.  If people think the company will do very well in the coming years, they buy in and it increases the share price due to supply vs demand.  

Companies can trade on Future Value (FV) which means the stock price is pricing in what they're going to be worth.  FV can range from 1-40 times the current book value (BV) of the company stock price...profit divided by total shares.  

Bio tech companies would be in the 30-40 range because of potential breakthrough technology. Normal companies like AMC would be at book value or maybe 1 or 2 times BV. 

With AMC, the stock should be trading over $500 a share right now in my opinion due to the overwhelming # of shares bought in the last 8-12 weeks, which reports show BUYS outnumber SELLS better than 3 to 1, with institutions also increasing their Holdings of AMC to now be over 16% of the shares. 

With the blatant manipulation and naked short selling, they are artificially suppressing the stock price.  They are selling shares that don't exist.  

How does a stock have 3-1 buys vs sells and the price drop?  Crookedness, right? 

They also do what's called short ladder attacks where they trade 100 share blocks back and forth between each other to bring the price down in a short period of time.  The volume doesn't line up with the price drop, which is why we all can see exactly what's happening. 

The CEO, Adam Aron, is going to do what he can to protect the company's interest and the shareholders. He is restricted a bit tho in that he can't make just any statement that may be considered manipulative to influence the price of his company stock.  This is why we are watching and listening very closely to the hints he's dropping. 

He put out a request to add 500 million shares to the company, which raised eyebrows and upset many investors because it would dilute the shares, weaken all investor positions and be a major gift to the short sellers by letting them off the hook. They would get to buy out their shorts at the lower price, which is a win for them. 

But after a few days, Boss apes started figuring out there must be a plan and that became clear over time. 

The short sellers dove in at the company's announcement seeking to add 500 million shares and the short sellers shorted the stock all the more on the news which drove the price down.  They were hoping to demoralize and disenfranchise investors to sell and go away. 

Oh but those apes tho!  

They flipped the script and started buying at the lower prices, adding to the real share count in the hands of investors.  More apes came on board and kept the buying pressure up. 

It wasn't long before the CEO announced they were taking the 500 million request off the table.  A brilliant move by the Aron to set the trap and then ensnare them! 

AMC would still file paperwork giving them the right to sell 43 million shares of company Holdings at the market price.  Would it be the current market or were they forward thinking of what would be coming if short sellers were forced to cover?  

Next play made was when Aron announced that they were delaying the annual shareholder meeting to July 29th and stated that they wanted to give their millions of individual shareholders a chance to vote.  That is not normal company protocol or verbiage.  Apes quickly figured out the underlying meaning...millions of individual shareholders, which is extremely abnormal. 

Aron confirmed later in the day that there are over 3 million individual shareholders.  Wow!  Insanity! 

If 3 million are holding an average of 100 shares at $10 per share average, that's only $1000 to them, but that brings the potential # to 300,000,000 shares in our hands. 

Well the institutions hold 16% or 72 million shares. Many folks are holding over 1000 shares, some over 10k shares. 

This is why estimates are believed to be between 1 billion and 6 billion shares in the hands of investors. 

Aron just announced that they would reveal the number of actual shareholders and the share count on June 2nd.  That was a warning shot to the short sellers and price manipulators. That they better start buying out real shares now or they are going to be in big trouble. 

Why?  Because if they wait til the announcement and it is made known that there are more than 100% shorted shares, it will send opportunists into a buying frenzy for a little piece of the action.  Buyers will come flooding in.  Manipulators won't be able to stop the spike because it will bid the price higher and higher very quickly. They won't be able to sell enough fake shares to keep the price suppressed. 

You see...if 3 million people are holding at least 2 x's the actual shares that exist, then those shares have to be bought back to cover the short positions over the amount that should actually be in the market.  

If no one is willing to sell or sitting on the sell side with orders to sell then shorts are trading back and forth with Market Makers and the price keeps bidding higher and higher until they find someone willing to part with their shares.   They have to keep bidding the price up and up and up in a bid for shares until they find enough shares to satisfy their short positions. 

If shareholders are not parting for less than $500 a share and only half of their shares at that point, they will only satisfy a portion of their short positions.  They have to bid it higher still, which could drive it well beyond $500.  Some are saying they're not willing to part with a single share for less than $1,000 whereas others want at least $100,000 per share to teach these crooks a lesson. 

As a CEO, I would like to squeeze them to the point they go bankrupt because of their corrupt ways that will no doubt continue if we do not teach them the lessons they deserve.  It's obvious the Regulatory bodies are not going to do so.

# Chapter 1: Comparing GME to Volkswagen

>*""In history, a great volume is unrolled for our instruction, drawing the materials of future wisdom from the past errors and infirmities of mankind.""*  
>  
>\-Edmund Burk

It's really hard to predict the future, but one can obtain some foresight with hindsight. I will examine the Volkswagen short squeeze and attempt to draw conclusions that can be applied to GME.

When people think of the Volkswagen chart, they usually think of this picture:

https://preview.redd.it/8q3tv408stl61.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=588fdd5bbd35dd22da794963878b83b58e73d447

This chart is a daily chart. The scale of the X-axis is 1 day, where each candlestick represents 1 day. As a day trader, this data is pretty useless to me because the fidelity of the data is really low. It's like watching an IMAX movie at 720p.

So I did some digging looking for some more accurate data on VW. Thanks to  [u/myhomeswarty](https://www.reddit.com/user/myhomeswarty/) on [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lzfu45/vw_2008_short_squeeze_historical_data/), I was able to obtain some 10 minute data in excel. The scale of the X-axis is 10 minutes per candlestick; thus this this data is about **14x the fidelity** of a daily chart. I formatted the data and generated a candlestick chart for some deep dive analysis. Again here is [the excel chart](https://gofile.io/d/txVFki). Before I compare GME to VW, I'd like to address this question:

Why am I comparing VW to GME when these are two different stocks trading under very different market conditions?

Because there are useful similarities that persist across *all trades and across all stocks.* Prices can vary, but fundamental market dynamics remain the same.

You'll commonly see on Reddit a picture of the VW chart with the ""you are here"" label.

https://preview.redd.it/ivd9m9f9stl61.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5064a4b6e0dfbea07d35493a67acb62adfe91c1a

In my opinion, one should not make these kind of time comparisons. It really makes no sense, especially in hindsight when weeks have passed and GME is still in the same spot on that chart.

Honestly nobody knows where GME is at, but I can guess that the whales who decided to activate the GME rocket boosters with their gamma ramp are currently piloting our little rocket through the sky. We're not in space yet, but we've got the momentum to blast out of the stratosphere and travel our way to the moon. Anyways, back on topic.

# Chapter 2: What you can learn from the VW squeeze. Triangle wedges and the art of pattern recognition.

What I want to show you all is the comparisons that *are actually useful*. I believe that between Volkswagen and GameStop, they share traits that are caused by fundamental market dynamics.

Let's start with the 10 minute Volkswagen chart and compare it to the 1 Day Volkswagen chart. The 1D chart I will be using is $VOW traded on the XETR exchange where the squeeze occurred. It can be hard to find the right chart. [Here it is](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=XETR%3AVOW).

You'll notice that if you make the time scale smaller than 1D (like 4H), the chart refuses to show data from before 2014 likely because any data smaller than 1 Day from before 2014 is not stored. You can check Yahoo Finance and other sites. There simply is no data.

I would guess that finding 1 minute data would be challenging and likely involve paying a fee to some historical data storing service to access old VW data. Anyways, the 10 minute data should be high fidelity enough to analyze. Thanks  [u/myhomeswarty](https://www.reddit.com/user/myhomeswarty/) for finding this data.

With this higher fidelity 10m chart, what do you notice? Zoom in to the picture to see the dates at the bottom.

**10m Volkswagen Chart**

https://preview.redd.it/5k45jpjastl61.png?width=2140&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa7565771d6aa993e234c006d44ce054422366a5

Let me put the 1D chart next to the 10m chart to make it more obvious.

**10m and 1D charts stacked**

https://preview.redd.it/qijx1questl61.png?width=1399&format=png&auto=webp&s=382c23a600c61923c5cbe4cfd4d192c452f05f00

As you can see, the pink region (10/27/08 candlesticks) on the 10m chart corresponds to that one bar to the left of the big spike on the 1D chart. The orange region (10/28/08 candlesticks) is all smushed into the center green spike. And the cyan region (10/29/08 candlesticks)  corresponds to the tiny green bar to the right of the center spike.

The interesting part is the orange region, because **that's the region retailers will trade: the peak of the squeeze.** The interesting thing I see is a triangle wedge. We'll dive into that later and discuss why the presence of a wedge is important.

I think what people might find scary about the 1D chart is the huge drop after the squeeze. I see a lot of people thinking that the peak is symmetrical. **The peak is not symmetrical; the price will likely not drop down all the way to the base of the spike in one swift motion.** In the VW 10m chart, I see that to the right of the peak, there is what appears to be a triangle wedge.

https://preview.redd.it/6x7a1lslstl61.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7eaf662dd61cab016fdac74d5a59a25f39a0add

>Triangle patterns are aptly named because the upper and lower trendlines ultimately meet at the apex on the right side, forming a corner.  
>  
>Triangles are similar to wedges and pennants and can be either a continuation pattern, if validated, or a powerful **reversal** **pattern**, in the event of failure.  
>  
>[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/triangle.asp)

Even if you miss the peak, **there's a second chance to sell** because the price will bounce back up retracing some percentage of the height of the triangle. In fact it should bounce a couple times within the narrowing channel before ultimately crashing to pre-squeeze levels.

You might think this is some conspiracy theory. Triangles! Loominarti! How can you be certain we'll see a triangle?

Take a look at the DryShips short squeeze.

**Dryships 30m, short squeeze 2016**

https://preview.redd.it/h72ef53nstl61.png?width=1540&format=png&auto=webp&s=558807a1d046d6171a2a4954c05565ecc18d6ce5

Hah! No triangle! So this is a conspiracy!

Nope. Just zoom in.

Triangle wedge detected!

One can detect these wedges on almost every single momentum rally driven to unsustainable price levels.

You'll see that the second triangle in the GME rally formed a lot lower from the peak. This was because Robinhood and several other brokerages stopped users from buying. **That is market manipulation and the only reason why the second triangle formed really low.** If GME were to squeeze without market manipulation, one should see a healthy triangle wedge form like the triangle on the left during the first spike.

Why do triangle wedges form? Think about it like a pendulum. When a stock climbs, it's momentum eventually tappers off and reverses like a pendulum. It will swing in the opposite direction and eventually run out of downwards momentum. It swings back and forth until it reaches the apex where it comes to rest. Then the string snaps and it ""breaks out"" either up or down where it will eventually start forming another triangle.

Just rotate that image 90 degrees and you'll see what looks like a stock chart triangle.

Now that you can expect a triangle to form, you should also understand that **there exists a second chance to sell**. You won't fall off a cliff and instantly become a bagholder. Instead, imagine there being a floating trampoline that you can jump on a few times before the fabric breaks and sends you falling down.

&#x200B;

Now how long will the peak last? I don't know, but I speculate it should last longer than the approximately hour long peak Volkswagen had. **We may have at least a solid hour to time the peak!**

# Chapter 3: Why selling early is disadvantageous and how to use triangles as signals to time an exit

**Selling too early can drastically reduce your gains.** If enough people sell early, that can also reduce the price ceiling of the squeeze. The more float that becomes available, the higher the supply and the lower the price. Looking back at Volkswagen, on 10/29/08, **Volkswagen released just 5% of the float, but that resulted in about a 33% price drop between closing price on the 28th and opening price on the 29th**

>On Wednesday 29, Porsche, perhaps realising their actions had caused some damage, generously provided an extra 5 per cent of the shares to the stricken shorts. By Friday, Volkswagen's ordinaries closed at €497, down 50 per cent from the Tuesday highs as the squeeze loosened.

**Diamond handing leads to more locked up float which leads to a higher price ceiling for the squeeze.** Not only does selling early reduce your potential gains, it also reduces the price ceiling potential. Now the comparison to Volkswagen is just to show the effects of supply and price. Don't take those number literally, GME has much higher short interest than VW and much more institutional and retail ownership. One cannot really can't estimate how much an X% of float released will affect the Y% price drop.

Now let's look at a hypothetical chart of what GME might look like in the future. Given the unique nature of a triangle pattern, there are many places to pick a selling point. I think it will be tricky to spot the true Alpha Triangle. The one triangle at the tippy tippy top.

There may be **multiple triangles** on the way up. It might even be difficult to tell when the actual shorts start covering as many of the triangles before the peak will occur during gamma squeezes.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ywymcij2ttl61.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=21becb52c4c2fd75b17ceff26537d4f6da772040

After the apex of each triangle is a **breakout**. Usually a large movement in either direction.

https://preview.redd.it/56kw61x5ttl61.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=31100027f5a951a0595b4f544687a954b1247579

I believe that the differentiator between a period of small gamma squeezes, and the period when shorts actually cover, is a smooth rally breakout. Watch out for this.

https://preview.redd.it/1o8ozw57ttl61.png?width=2331&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7eb99f9b375b7921d9212787c890ec062f730cb

This smooth rally breakout should have a vertical height **much longer than any previous breakout rallies**. People expect this stock to hit into the thousands, so it would be reasonable to assume that there will be a smooth rally breakout of at least $500 dollars in length. After that breakout occurs, the momentum is too great to form triangles. It will tear through the stratosphere until it eventually loses steam and forms a peak triangle. Please take this with a grain of salt. Trading halts might cause small eddies to form mini triangles on the way up. **You should anticipate multiple trading halts and see ""eddies"" appear when the momentum is disrupted.** This could be either a smooth rally, or a bumpy rally. Nobody really knows.

The height of these smooth/bumpy rallies should be positively correlated with the buying momentum. I would wager that covering shares will result in higher momentum than hedging by market makers. This is because MMs can pace out how quickly they want to buy up shares, whereas if multiple shorts begin getting margin called, even though shorts have a couple days to meet the margin call, **there are way more shorts than market makers**, resulting in a frenzied race to be the first to cover all their shares. This leads to more momentum than a gamma squeeze, and thus a longer breakout rally.

Of course the stages of the GME squeeze won't be binary. There will be a mix of covering, momentum trading, and gamma hedging at each step of the way. But ultimately at the end, the largest concentration of covering should happen leading up to the peak.

In short, keep your eye out for a really long breakout rally triggering multiple halts. This is a sign that you might be nearing the peak. Eventually, if you think it's peaked and hit your price target, the next step is to trade the triangle.

# Chapter 4: Trading the triangle

How does one trade a triangle?

https://preview.redd.it/04u1wy8bvul61.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc95d36d08106c71dd67e0442e1f8103ba91b4e

From my experience, I usually pick across 4 different regions on the triangle to sell. I sometimes sell everything at one spot, or I sell a pic at each peak. I would personally spread my GME sell orders across different regions and **not sell my entire position at once**, even if the triangle finishes and begins to breakout. This is because it could go to the upside and go even higher. Therefore it would make sense to keep some shares and let those ride out. **You can use Limit Sells to pick a precise exit point. Or you can use a Trailing Stop Loss for more advanced setups if you really want to maximize gains.**

So what does each letter in the above image point to?

# Region A, slightly below the beginning peak of the triangle

The first peak of the triangle. Often you might think this is the peak, but it actually keeps going upwards signaling that the triangle has not yet formed. Thus, I usually only sell enough shares to cover my initial investment and then sell a few extra for guaranteed profit.

**Pros:** Potentially the highest price you can sell at.

**Cons:** The stock can reverse and keep shooting higher. Thus you could also potentially sell at a lower than expected price

**Recommended strategy:** Sell enough to cover initial investment with a moderate amount of extra shares for guaranteed gains.

# Region B, the second peak that verifies the triangle pattern

The second peak forming will let you draw out a prediction for what the triangle will look like. You only reach B after the peak has formed and the price is falling back down. By connecting the two peaks and drawing both a flat and angled support, you end up with two possible predictions of what the triangle will shape up to be.

https://preview.redd.it/h17hhng9ttl61.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=86e585e528344586bf15195bc52319972b8e7dfa

By drawing these two triangles, you can form an estimate of how much time you have left to decide on your exit strategy before the apex forms and the price breaks out.

Point B is the ""telling peak"" that will allow you to draw predictions. It's also a great time to sell a large amount of shares as it has basically confirmed the triangle formation. Keep in mind that **sometimes the chart can be misleading**. It could just be a descending channel or an extended sideways trend. Nevertheless, you can still draw out triangles in anticipation that the price continues to bounce within the triangle.

In any case, whether it's a descending channel or a triangle, you can assume that this is the second highest the price will go (unless you expect a breakout to the upside after the apex forms. In which case, this is not the Alpha Triangle).

**Pros:** Potentially the second highest price you can sell at. Can confirm the triangle pattern and help you anticipate future price movements.

**Cons:** This could be a false signal of a triangle. The worse case scenario is you sell too many shares and the price bounces and goes even higher.

**Recommended strategy:** Sell a moderate to large amount of shares, but not too many as you want to leave some in case it shoots up after.

# Region C, the apex has formed

By the time the apex forms, you will have confirmation that this is a triangle. At this point, you need to make the decision on whether or not to sell the majority of your remaining. **Pay attention to the news. Refresh reddit. There may be new developments that signal that the squeeze can continue.** In which case, the price will breakout to the upside and you should not sell. Otherwise, if you are confident, sell almost all your shares, but leave a tiny amount to ride region D if it breaks out to the upside.

**Pros:** Confirmation of the triangle pattern. A good place to almost completely exit.

**Cons:** The price may breakout to the upside again and you just sold for a low amount.

**Recommended strategy:** Sell the majority of your remaining shares if you are confident it will not breakout to the upside again. Check the news to see if there are telltale signs that the squeeze will continue.

# Region D, the breakout

Usually day traders have a threshold that confirms a breakout. Essentially the price needs to move sufficiently above or below the apex to confirm that the breakout is in the right direction. I usually just eyeball it and count 4 individual 1 minute candle sticks that are consecutively above or below the apex. That's how I confirm the breakout. Once the breakout is confirmed, you are now in Region D. The strategy for this is simple. Sell all your shares if it breaks out to the downside. Hold your remaining shares if it breaks out to the upside. Then wait for the next triangle to form and repeat this strategy. **The biggest challenge is finding that Alpha Triangle.** There's a chance you might be trading a non Alpha Triangle, so you might want to reduce how much you sell in each region inversely proportional to how confident you are that this is indeed the Alpha Triangle.

**Pros:** Confirmation of future short term movement. Breakout to upside = short term bullish movements. Vice versa.

**Cons:** Sometimes the breakout might be a fakeout, and it can completely 180. This doesn't happen often though.

**Recommended strategy:** Breakout to the upside = hold. Breakout to the downside = sell.

# Chapter 5: Summary and a Word of Caution

Comparing time data between VW and GME doesn't make much sense. But comparing trends and market dynamics does.

You've seen that triangles typically form after unsustainable peaks. Trading GME will involve spotting these triangles and looking out for the Alpha Triangle. To summarize the steps in this trading plan:

1. Look for a smooth rally. Above this will likely be the **Alpha Triangle**, the highest triangle ever.
2. Trade the Alpha Triangle, and leave some shares in the event that the price goes even higher.
3. Rinse and repeat until the stock crashes and hopefully you have fully exited.

Do take all this with a grain of salt though, as a few exceptions exists that do not form triangles, but rather descending channels or a sharp price cliff. The reason why I am convinced we will see a triangle, is because triangles form from the return of buying pressure after the drop, thus reversing the downwards momentum and swinging back up like a pendulum. I expect a return of buying  pressure because **it will take a long time for shorts to cover**. There will be continuous buying, so I don't think the price will drop sharply back to 40 dollars.

Remember that selling early is disadvantageous as it reduces the potential price ceiling. **It's better to sell on a downtick than on an uptick.** You won't know how high it can climb, but you can tell with a high degree of certainty if you've reached a local peak when the red candlestick pops up.

And lastly, remember there is no ""us"" or ""we"". These are simply day trading observations and strategies applied to GME. Trade GME however you want to. If you are convinced my exit strategy makes sense, feel free to give it a try! I will come back to this and add edits as I watch GME when trading resumes and try to add insightful additions to this DD. I hope to see all you apes on the moon very soon  💎👐  **🚀** !

**TLDR;** Selling early is bad. **Sell on the way down**. **Look out for triangle patterns** and understand how to trade them! **Don't sell everything at once, scale out slowly**. Try your best to time the peak and know that a telltale sign that you are near the peak is a huge green candle stick before reversing. **The peak is not symmetric! The price won't drop immediately back to 40; it should bounce a few times!**

**Aim for the fucking moon! Settle for more, not less :D**

**Edit 1:** I noticed some of you mentioned High Frequency Trading algorithms in your comments. Did I account for those? Yes I believe I did, just haven't mentioned explicitly. High frequency trading is typically the bane of day traders. They are designed to beat human traders by trading microseconds before us. However, ""Stocks in Play"" are stocks that have a significant proportion of human traders, like GME for example. Thus sometimes HFT algos actually amplify retail driven trends. I believe HFT algorithms contribute to the formation of these triangles, especially algorithms like ""Buy the new Low"".

>The most disappointing HFT program known today is the so-called “Buy the New Low” program. A stock will make a new intraday low which will make many day traders go short and ride the downside momentum. The program will then start buying the shorts from the day traders and ultimately push the stock higher, causing all of the day traders to panic and cover. It sounds pretty effective, especially since the institutions that run these HFT programs have essentially unlimited buying power. The problem with this algorithm is when another large institutional seller is behind the trade and wants to dump their large positions. No matter how many shares the program buys, the stock will never push higher. The more the program buys, the more the institutional seller and day traders will dump their shares on it.  
>  
>This algorithm failed miserably in September 2008 when the investment bank Lehman Brothers (ticker: LEH, now de-listed after bankruptcy), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp (ticker: FRE), and many other mortgage holdings and investment banks, all started a massive downward drop in price. Programs were trying to buy their stock to squeeze and burn the short sellers, but since those stocks were already fundamentally broken, their stock price never went higher. Day traders and huge institutional sellers dumped their shares on the program. Those programs and their developers were obliterated, left holding a literally huge number of worthless shares of LEH and FRE and other bankrupted holdings  
>  
>How to Day Trade for a Living by Aziz

Though ""Buy the New Low"" probably doesn't run anymore, I believe similar algorithms do that create buying pressure in conjunction with human traders forming the edge of the triangles. Both humans and computers have a desire to buy the dip so to speak. I believe HFT algos also amplify rallies. Thus in our smooth rally, HFTs will likely buy in early on in the rally, and sell high late into the rally. This ultimately amplifies the height of the rally.

&#x200B;

**Edit 2:** INDICATORS!! **Should we use indicators?** I usually trade without them, but sure why not because they can help you better estimate the peak. I personally like MACD a lot to look for reversals.

Eyeball where you think the MACD lines will intersect and go negative. The peak should be slightly to the left of the intersection.

There's also RSI. I believe this stock can stay in the overbought zone on the RSI for a long time. So just look for overbought on the RSI and expect it to stay there a while.

An extra word of caution. Above I said that at point D, if it breaks out to the downside, it will crash. Yes, but maybe temporarily. It might form another triangle and then break back to the upside. This is why I recommend you **set a sufficiently high price target** before you anticipate any Alpha Triangles. If you want to trade with higher risk, then consider buying back in if it forms a triangle again and breaks out to the upside. I would buy back at point D again when it begins climbing. **Keep in mind this downside then upside scenario is unlikely if the price target is sufficiently high.**

Lastly for this edit, why am I sharing my exit strategy? Traders are compelled to share their strategy because if everyone uses their strategy, they have an easier time trading the strategy! The more people that use the same indicators and the same timings, the more effective the trading strategy. Don't try to do something different. Go with the crowd. Do what everyone else is doing.

**Edit 3:** Will the smooth rally be guarunteed? Will shorts be margin called or can they hold through this? No one knows. There were definitely shorts that held through the VW squeeze who actually added shorts at the top and made a hefty profit on the way down. In the worst case scenario for us, the Alpha Triangle may appear at the top of a gamma squeeze and the price will be lower than anticipated. This could be because shorts hold through, Robinhood stops buyers, etc.

**Edit 4:** Seems my image links were messed up and it was just showing preview image links instead of the actual images. I fixed that issue.

The act of dividing potential allies and communities who could come together to rise up is one of the oldest and most infuriatingly effective tricks in the book. Too often social justice movements have splintered as a result of not being prepared to counter such moves.

**WHAT ARE WE FACING?**

* **Downvotes** \- Important information being suppressed and not being able to reach front page of reddit.
* **More Tickers** \- Dividing our investments into smaller positions making it easier for HF to take them on one by one.
* **False information** \- Misinformation to get our hopes up just to tear it down, creating doubt and fear
* **New Spam Accounts** \-  To make the narrative seem as if we moved on and have doubts about the squeeze
* **Banning top DD posters** \- Trying to remove our trusted knowledge and information to change the narrative
* **Fake News** \- Scaring away any potential new investors using main stream media outlets

# TOPPLE THEIR DIVIDE-&-CONQUER GAME

&#x200B;

* **Show support** \- upvote all helpful information and positivity making our voices loud and heard.
* **Educate** \- Don't only educate yourself, educate others. All of us have fallen for misinformation at some point, rather than accusing people of being shills try and teach them why they are wrong.
* **Downvote Shills** \- Despite what I just said about educating, some people are in here just to spread misinformation and doubt, if you see this, downvote and report.
* **Show Your Strength** \- Show that you don't mind waiting for them juicy tendies and that it doesn't matter is the squeeze is today or next year. Maybe for $20 it's not worth the wait, however we are after much more than that.
* **Form More Groups** \- It's inevitable for reddit to go down during the squeeze, join the r/GME discord, it's also possible that even this sub will be taken over by new mods and ruined, so like the saying goes 'don't keep all your eggs in one basket'

Thank you for reading this post.

This is just an idea, depending on how much support I get, I might start running some social media campaigns on Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook and some others about GME, any suggestions are welcome. My day job is a marketing manager, and I think it's unfair we are up against main stream media. Just and idea.

Listen up my fellow ape brothers and sisters, I have lurked this beautiful community since the 45s, commenting and trying to help our fellow apes with what I can. STRAP THE FUCK IN BECAUSE I AM ABOUT TO TELL YOU WHY SITTING ON THIS ROCKET AND WAITING IS THE BEST DECISION APES COULD HAVE MADE FOR THEIR LIFE.

**I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I AM IN NO MEANS A FINANCIAL ADVISOR, SO EVERYTHING I WRITE HERE IS JUST MY OWN OPINION I WANT TO SHARE WITH EVERYONE AND NO PERSON OR APE SHOULD TAKE ANY OF THIS NONSENSE AS INVESTMENT ADVICE.**

# The GAME that we have gotten ourselves into:

Now in order to figure out why this ticking time bomb of glory is so precious, beautiful, and unprecedented, we must first dive into what this little game is we are playing.

The game we have entered into my fellow apes, is one that is not only played with our beloved GME, but with countless other stocks in the market. Almost always, this game is played by the shorts and the shorts alone, banding together in hordes and driving companies into the dirt all the while reaping INSANE profits on their 'plays'. The shorts are usually successful in these plays, due to their gargantuan presence and influence throughout the market. They are able to psychologically beat those that oppose them through controlling the market by methods such as, short attacks, ETF shorting, naked shorting, and payment for order flow, as well as controlling the narrative by paying the media, journalists, growth hackers, and social media experts. They know the market is ultimately a giant PSYCHOLOGICAL game, they know that fear, uncertainty and doubt will kick in and cause further selling pressure from the way they attack the price at vulnerable times. Ultimately they want to cover their position once it is profitable for them, meaning the price is lower than the original value they bet against. There are countless amounts of companies with different short interests, this value can range from 0 percent to 20 percent to higher. **From an industry standard basis, 20 percent is considered a high short interest. For example, in Jul 13 2020, Tesla experienced a soar to approximately 1554.65 USD from approximately 200 USD... this happened with a short interest of around 25 percent.**

**NOW THIS SPECIFIC GAME WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF IS VERY DIFFERENT TO OTHERS LIKE IT.**

THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE DIFFERENCE:

The shorts have shorted more than 100% of the shares available AND THEY HAVE TRIED TO SHORT IT TO ZERO BRINGING THE PRICE TO AS LOW AS 3 DOLLARS A SHARE IN 2020... IN OTHER WORDS THEY HAVE CREATED A GAME WHERE...

I WOULD LIKE TO QUOTE THE WONDERFUL MARK CUBAN HERE:

**""Their goal is to NEVER cover their short, because that would get the company going out of business or getting delisted.""**

**In other words,**

**THE SHORTS WE ARE AGAINST CAN ONLY WIN IF GME = 0**

Yes, I see the red pill is starting to kick in Neo.

This scenario CANNOT happen, the fundamentals of GME guarantee that with a 99% certainty. This also means that the shorts have already lost the game. Now imagine a chess match with a lone king on the board against an entire army of bishops, pawns, rooks, and knights... The lone king can still move and ""kick the can down the road"" all he wants, but the end is pretty much guaranteed.

# The ENDGAME:

We are now in the endgame, and have been here for a while. The endgame started after Jan 28th when the restrictions came in, alongside short attacks which tanked the price gradually to around 40 dollars a share. At this point we know, based on the GME SEC filing that was recently released, that more than 100 percent of the float was and still is shorted. Wonderful, GGWP.

Ok but now, why does the price keep going up and down?

So here is where things start to get interesting, and this is where I start to knight you with the Sword of the Thousand Truths just before I finally give it to you to wield on your warpath to the holy lands.

**What you are currently seeing on the tickers everyday on market open, is not the real price of GME. The real price of GME is buried under so much shorting pressure (short attacks, ETF shorting, naked shorting) that lifting it would blow up the price to historical unprecedented galactic levels causing shock waves across the universe as we know it.**

This phenomenon can be further added to if we look at the following amazing DD:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel\_has\_no\_clothes/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/)

Through this DD We can come to the conclusion that we are playing against an absolute degenerate of a cheater in this game. So even though he has lost the game despite disgustingly cheating the system, he will continue to perform illegal practices and tactics to further tame and manipulate the stock, being very careful for it not to break tipping points where it could explode beyond control... aka buying himself time... aka kicking the can down the road... aka denying the inevitable... aka remember yourself when you were beyond angry in a video game because you were losing so badly you just wanted to fuck shit up before you were out.

**THIS ALSO MEANS THAT THE PRICE IS ARTIFICIAL, AND THAT THE SHORTS WILL TRY TO GRADUALLY SHOW THE HOLDERS OF GME MORE AND MORE HIGHER PRICES IN THEIR OWN RANGE THAT THEY CAN AFFORD WITHOUT BEING ABSOLUTELY MARGIN CALLED TO DEATH.**

**THINK ABOUT THIS AS A NEGOTIATION BETWEEN US AND THE SHORTS...**

**The shorts keep coming to us offering different prices for our priceless diamonds,**

**Shorts in Jan 28: Aight guys we are offering you maximum of 460 dollars for a share of your GME... Oh look the price is going more down, more people are accepting our offer, haha you better sell yours too!**

**Shorts in Feb: Hahaha, I told you idiots to take the offer on 460 dollars, now look where we are, we dont negotiate with longs. Last chance to take whats on the table with 150 dollars a share. This company is valued at 15 dollars a share, 150 is a steal!**

**Shorts in later Feb: I told you, this is a dying company. 45 dollars a share better sell now hahahah. You should have listened!!!**

**Shorts in March after radio silence: Okay guys... well this is awkward... so maybe it didnt work out the first time, how about I come back to the table like in Jan, but because you didnt agree to my price I am only willing to go as high as 360 dollars a share! You better take it now or else I am not coming back I SWEAR!**

**You get the picture...**

# So they control the price?

Well that is not entirely correct. They can heavily manipulate the price, but they in no way totally control it. They have to manipulate the market as realistically and quietly as they can.

Here is an interesting excerpt from the Tesla short squeeze that applies here:

""And then something happened which at first glance looks illogical. Usually, one would say that the higher the share price, the higher the short share goes. **Indeed, the development of the business must cover the share price development.** **The more the share price rises, the better the business must go or the outlook must be. When the price decouples from the fundamental basis, the short-seller attacks. So much for the presumed logic. However, a problem for short-sellers arises when the price goes up and up and up, and they have to buy stocks to cover their obligations, which creates an enormous demand on the market.""**

Yes, now apply all that to GME.

GME has placed itself in a position where it cannot ''decouple'' from its share price due to its incredible fundamentals. In my opinion is the best investment I could make by such a long shot that there are really no investments that exist like it.

You see, GME is what i like to call a double edged sword, where you have an investment that has points of power on multiple fronts. This makes it a strong investment regardless of petty temporary movements.

**GME has three incredible fronts as an investment:**

1. **Incredible, company fundamentals. GME is in the process of transforming into a digital powerhouse for video games, and it could not be in a better leadership position with GOD ENTREPRENEUR Ryan Cohen spearheading its future. The industry and focus of the company is in a very flexible position where it has immense opportunities to expand into and conquer varying markets. GME is literally a future GIANT in the making with its leadership and brand value.**
2. **GME is shorted more than 100 percent of its float confirmed! This means that attached to a company that can fundamentally be more than 1500 USD a share by, for example 2025, there is downward pressure on the stock that exceeds its available shares. THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SCENARIO BECAUSE THE RISE OF THE PHOENIX HAPPENED AFTER THE SHORTS HAD GATHERED IN TO FEAST. THIS SCENARIO CANNOT CEASE TO EXIST DUE TO THE NATURAL NEW SHIFT AND DIRECTION OF GME AND THE INABILITY OF THE SHORTS TO CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS THEY WANT TO LITERALLY DIE AS COMPANIES.**
3. **A new wave of unparalleled customer loyalty and fandom that is growing in its numbers everyday. Now who better to lead these already loyal customers whilst bringing in waves of new and satisfied customers all the while leading the company to its promise land of glory... The master of customer excellence, Ryan Cohen.**

So why is it good to understand this?

Because this shows me that UNDENIABLE UPWARD ORGANIC PRESSURE on the this over boiled pot is coming with the many catalysts that will come from GAMESTOP's side in this battle, one of the most outstanding ones revolving around the shareholder voting meeting that will take place around June.

# The FINISHING BLOW. THE END OF THE SHORTS.

The end is near for the shorts. This game is over, they just haven't threw in the towel yet. The price is artificial and we know for a fact we are dealing with a criminal who cheats the system. Cheating the system can only however buy you time, and that is what is happening right now. They are just delaying the inevitable.

**What is the finishing blow? It is definitely a catalyst that will come from GME's side, be it a new CFO, CEO, announcement of game plan moving forward, dividend, or lenders recalling their shares to vote in the meeting taking place in June. The possibilities are endless, THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD CARE ABOUT IS NOT WHEN IT BLOWS, BUT THAT YOU ARE ON IT WHEN IT BLOWS. It can be literally anything that comes from Gamestop's side fundamentally as a company.**

My guess? It revolves around the shareholder meeting in June.

**So what is the takeaway from this? You have made the best investment of your life, no matter what, no matter how long it takes, remember the facts as I outlined above. STOP BEING SO EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED TO THE CURRENT TICKER. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT. They can show you whatever price they want, IF IT DOESNT LOOK LIKE THE MOASS THEN IT IS NOT THE MOASS.**

**The only weapon you need throughout all this is one thing, wield it with you at all times, for the journey ahead is unpredictable. The only thing you need to constantly reassure yourself in this, is that you placed your investment in the right place from all the fundamental angles (what the shorts hate), and now that the equation is perfectly set up for the MOASS you need one thing and one thing only: PATIENCE.**

MY GOLDEN STOCK EQUATION: (AMAZING FUNDAMENTALS) + **(PATIENCE)** = PROFIT

MY GME EQUATION: (AMAZING FUNDAMENTALS) + **(PATIENCE)** \+ (RIDICULOUS SHORTING) = MOASS.

Make **PATIENCE** your manual, your guide, your light, your ethos, and everything you need whenever you fear the primitive ape in you start to get worried due to THEIR THEATRICS.

Sit and enjoy the ride, interact with this beautiful community, and enjoy exploring more about this saga we are all apart of through the fascinating DD that is posted daily on the sub.

**TLDR**: **The end is in sight apes, GME is a company with incredible fundamentals due to its transformation (what shorts hate), so the catalyst will come, and it will SURE AS SHIT come from Gamestop's side (new CEO, CFO, shareholder vote etc) . It will be beautiful to watch as we soar past the galaxies in this rocket. Organic upward pressure from a transformed company is the worst enemy of shorts that want to never cover so just be PATIENT. MOASS IS COMING.**

AND MY GOLDEN RULE WHEN YOU FOUND YOUR RIGHT STOCKS IN THE FUTURE AFTER MOASS: HOLD TILL PROFIT OR BUST (and buy the dips).

Also huge PSA to all: Watch the show: Billions (from Showtime). It is absolutely incredible from a film standpoint, but more than that you will gain creative insight about what goes on behind the scenes with these HFs in a lot of detail. Absolutely great complex drama, really recommend it!

Remember there are no loyalties on Wall St. SEC might be corrupt BUT we are dealing with a lot of money here. They'd love to get some of that money more than they would to protect their friends. There is no loyalty on Wall St when it comes to money.

**TL;DR: Retail investors not only hold more long positions that the entire number of shares outstanding, but also control a bunch of shares through deep ITM call options. Therefore, long whales selling during the squeeze would only cause a dip and would not be enough to end the squeeze. In addition, a lot of long whales will not or cannot sell during the squeeze in my opinion, more details below. Conclusion: $2,000,000/share is definitely possible.**

&#x200B;

# A) Estimation of retail long positions

As far as I'm aware, there isn't any data that can provide an exact number of shares held by retail investors, so I'll have to estimate that number.

First, let's look at the most obvious indicator: the r/wallstreetbets [subreddit growth](https://subredditstats.com/r/wallstreetbets) during the fake squeeze in January.

https://preview.redd.it/pmqiwcitzep61.png?width=775&format=png&auto=webp&s=e21adb54879104daa80d6684cfa3602a86bce6b6

On the 23rd of January, the number of wsb subscribers was right around 2 million. It then skyrocketed and reached 9 million by the middle of February, so it's safe to say that the 7 million new users are at the very least interested in $GME. Now, let's assume that each new user holds *on average* 10 shares.(keep in mind that a whole lot of users own hundreds, if not thousands of shares, and DFV owns 100,000 shares by himself, so I think my estimation is quite conservative)

**That would mean that wsb users alone own 70 million shares.**

**That's over 100% of shares outstanding and 155% of float.** [Outstanding vs Float](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/062315/what-difference-between-shares-outstanding-and-floating-stock.asp)

Please note that this number does not even include all other retail investors, nor Reddit users on other subreddits such as r/GME and r/Wallstreetbetsnew, nor wsb investors who have not created a Reddit account/subscribed to wsb. So the actual retail ownership might actually be a LOT more than that.

*Also note that a good portion of the float is locked away in ETFs and mutual funds that rebalance quarterly or even yearly.*

&#x200B;

# B) Shares held through options

You may have herd the term **delta hedging** thrown around quite a few times around here. [In case you've never heard of delta hedging](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltahedging.asp)

Basically, the market makers who sell options contracts have algorithms that will keep them delta neutral, which keeps their risks low. Now, as a call option goes deeper and deeper in-the-money (ITM), its delta becomes closer and closer to 1. Since options are leveraged at 100x, this gives a delta of 100 for each deep ITM call options.

For example, let's say a market maker (MM) **sold** one deep ITM call option. Because they are short the option, their current delta would be -100.

**How do they stay delta neutral?**     2 ways:

1. First way would be to **sell a deep ITM put option**, which is the exact opposite of what they just did, which brings their delta to 0, since deep ITM put options have a delta of -100. Because they are short the option, the delta of this transaction is +100, which brings their total to 0, AKA delta neutral.
2. Second way is to **buy the underlying stock**. The delta of one share of the stock is +1, so that means that the MM would have to buy **100 shares** (delta of +100) to stay delta neutral.

Now that we've gone over the basics, let's see what happens when $GME squeezes. When the price of GameStop shares reach 1k, 10k, 100k, 1mil, etc. every single call option currently held by retail investors will be deep in-the-money. That means that the market makers who sold these contracts would have an extremely negative delta.

**But here's where it gets interesting: the MM can't use the first way of delta hedging, with the put options they sold, because all of their short puts would be far OUT-the-money, which means that all those contracts would have a delta close to 0.**

**THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN BE DELTA NEUTRAL IS THE WAY NUMBER 2: BUYING 100 SHARES PER CALL OPTION.**

*That means that a good chunk of institutional ownership is* ***actually held by retail investors***\*, because as long as retail holds onto their call options, the market maker is going to hold onto the shares needed to keep a delta of 0.\*

For example, DFV, by holding on to his 500 deep ITM call options, would actually control 50,000 shares of $GME. That brings his total to 150,000 shares held under his diamond hands.

Currently, [call open interest](https://marketchameleon.com/Overview/GME/OptionSummary/) on GameStop is 390k (as of 10 AM EST), so hypothetically, if $GME reaches 1k right now, the MM would have to buy and hold 39 million extra shares for as long as the call options holders want.

&#x200B;

# C) Short selling

Now, let's see how short selling works and how it affects the number of long positions. Imagine this:

* A company with the ticker $EMG issues 100 shares and sells them on the market. Float (which in this case is the same as outstanding because there are no insiders) is therefore 100 shares. This number does **not** change.
* Buyer ***Long1*** buys these 100 shares and stores them with his broker. That means that the total number of long positions is 100.
* Now, shorter ***Short1*** borrows these shares from the broker and sells them on the market
* Buyer ***Long2*** buys these 100 shares and stores them with his broker. Now, the total number of long positions is 200, or twice the float, whereas the number of short positions is 100.
* Short interest is therefore 100% (100 short positions divided by float of 100 shares)
* Now, shorter ***Short2*** borrows the 100 shares from ***Long2***'s broker and sells them on the market.
* Buyer ***Long3*** buys theses shares.
* Total number of long positions is now **300**, which equals **300%** of float
* Short interest is now **200%** of float.

https://preview.redd.it/kegamv6wzep61.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ea34085ecbd2a9168d7fbfe7961e87f03839509

We can see that short selling **artificially dilutes the shares by increasing the number of long positions.** ^((take this with a grain of salt, this is all my own understanding of the market, please correct me if I'm wrong))

*What does this mean?*

It means that if the shorts want to cover (or ***have to***), they'll have to buy back 200 shares to return to the brokers.

But remember, there are now 300 longs out there that they can buy back from.

I wanted to clear that up, since I've seen a misconception going around quite a lot saying that,

>the shorts have to buy your shares multiple times over

This is **misleading**, because shorts don't necessarily need *your* shares. Sure, they need more shares than were ever issued by the company itself, but the shorting process itself creates artificial shares.

Back to our example, after shorts cover (by buying 200 of the 300 longs out there and returning them to the brokers), there will only be 100 shares left, which is exactly where we started.

HOWEVER, since they need to buy back a very large number of shares, the supply won't be able to keep up with the demand, so the price will shoot up until they can find longs willing to sell their shares. Let's say that ***Long1*** decides to sell his 100 shares. The price will stop going up, and might even dip slightly, since supply just increased. But once the order is filled, the shorts still need 100 shares more, so the price will keep going up until either ***Long2*** or ***Long3*** are willing to sell.

[Long whales selling would only be a dip during the squeeze](https://preview.redd.it/3phegvwyzep61.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb5c4c567d24db8ac0699a699b27fd2f9071f7d9)

1. ***Short1*** need to cover their 100 shares short, so they put in buy orders, supply cannot keep up, price goes up.
2. ***Long1*** sells their 100 shares, the buy orders get filled, price stalls.
3. Because of the price increase, ***Short2*** gets margin called and need to buy back 100 shares. Price goes up again.
4. At some point, ***Long2*** decides that the price is good enough, so they sell their 100 shares. Supply meets demand, price stops going up.
5. Return to equilibrium. ***Long3*** still hold their shares.

We can see that once the shorts all cover, the number of long positions will be equal to the number of shares that the company issued once again. This means that of the 300 long positions in total, the 200 first longs who are willing to sell will be able to sell at the price they set, and the remaining 100 longs will hold through the squeeze and not profit from it.

**The squeeze only ends once the total number of long positions is equal to the number of outstanding shares.**

So why do I bring this up? Remember how we estimated that retail held far more shares than were ever issued, either through long positions or through deep ITM options? Yeah, that means that *even if* every single long institution and insider sold 100% of their shares, retail would *still* have the power to decide the peak price of the squeeze, because shorts NEED the shares that retail hold. If retail wants to start selling only at $2,000,000/share, the price will get there **no matter what**. Whales selling would only be a dip, then once their order is completely filled and the supply dries up again, the price will shoot back up until they can find the next seller.

And that brings me to the next section: why long whales will not sell during the squeeze.

&#x200B;

# D) Who will hold through the squeeze?

So, we learned from the example that, at the end of the squeeze, the total number of long positions will be back to the initial number of shares issued by the company. For $GME, that means that there will be 70 million long positions left after the shorts cover every single short position they had.

We also know that [institutional holdings](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME) exceed the total number of shares outstanding. We don't know the exact number, since the date of reporting differs for each institution, but it's safe to assume that the real number is close to 120% of shares outstanding.

https://preview.redd.it/p9tasb910fp61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=372ccb47278dcd0ccc4a6f3de6b897f1807b31c2

Who will not sell during the squeeze? (note that this is only my educated guess, we have no way of knowing for sure)

**Exhibit A: Insiders**

According to the [short-swing profit rule](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/704384/000119312504051976/dex995.htm) (here's an [explanation by investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortswingprofitrule.asp)), insiders cannot make a buy and a sell transaction within 6 months of each other. This means that they can't just sell all their shares during the squeeze and buy them back a week later. If they do sell, they'll have to wait another 6 months to buy them back.

Now, I'll admit, I don't know much about insider trading and the stock market in general, but I feel like it wouldn't be advantageous for board members to reduce their voting power during the digital revolution of their company. [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME) says that over 27% of shares outstanding are held by insiders, which is about 19 million shares.

https://preview.redd.it/qjjwgr630fp61.png?width=399&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dd1869e596fbfaa47c1afd0cf8b6ea8578cab19

**Exhibit B: Papa Cohen, BlackRock and Vanguard**

First of all, since RC owns more than 10% of the company's shares, he is considered an insider by the SEC's definition. That means that he also is not allowed to buy and sell shares within 6 months. Therefore, I think it's safe to say that RC's 9 million shares will be held through the squeeze. Otherwise, RC would lose his voting power to kick out the dead weight on GameStop's board of directors for 6 months.

In addition, as explained by [this DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md89wg/king_kong_magnum_opus_dd_posted_on_behalf_of_wuz/), BlackRock and Vanguard, which are two of the biggest institutional longs of $GME, are probably helping RC get the votes he needs to kick out the useless board members that slow down GameStop's digital revolution. So these shares would also be locked away during the squeeze.

That gives us 9 million shares from RC, 9 million more from BlackRock, and 5 million from Vanguard, which totals over 23 million shares held by these three Long Moby Dicks.

**Exhibit C: ETFs and mutual funds**

As noted previously, mutual funds and ETFs usually rebalance quarterly, which means that they will likely miss out on the squeeze, since the MOASS is expected to last less than a month. That means that however many shares they have will be locked away, and can't be bought by shorts trying to cover.

https://preview.redd.it/6lis6xd50fp61.png?width=906&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6122f02dc5aed4df2c459bda931acac024cd1fe

According to [Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/holders?p=GME) again, the top 10 mutual funds hold more than 17% of shares outstanding, or over 12 million shares.

There are likely millions more from all the other ETFs and mutual funds that didn't make the top 10.

&#x200B;

**So in total, it would mean that at least 54 million of the 70 million outstanding shares are actually locked away and will not be sold during the squeeze.**

*Side note: it might look like I counted RC's 9 million shares twice, since I said he was an insider by the SEC's standard, however when looking at the* [*insider transaction history*](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/insider-transactions?p=GME)*, we can see that RC's 9-million-share purchase is not listed, therefore he isn't part of the % held by insiders.*

&#x200B;

**This means that every ape will likely be able to get the price they want for their shares.**

&#x200B;

# E) GameStop will not issue more shares

Another thing I'd like to address is the fear that GameStop might raise money by issuing millions more shares and saving the shorts in the process.

*But here's why GameStop won't bail out the hedgies.*

Firstly, during the earnings call, we found out that GameStop actually has plenty of cash to spare and that their earnings were better than expected. Plus, they've gotten a shit ton of free publicity from the January fake squeeze, which means that they're probably making more money than ever before.

Secondly, just think about it. Why would GameStop save the shorts who tried to bankrupt them with illegal naked shorting and maybe even more shady shit I'm not aware of? Why would GameStop issue shares at 1k or 10k when they know they could raise funds at 500k if they need the money? Why would GameStop stop a short squeeze that would benefit millions of retail investors?

GameStop's customers are Redditors. GameStop's customers are retail investors. They're not hedge funds. They're not market makers. They're not any other institution.

If they dilute their shares and help the shorts, they would only shoot themselves in the foot. They would face immense backlash, similar to Robinhood. They would lose the faith of millions of individuals/potential customers. They would NEVER recover from such a nearsighted action, and Ryan Cohen, as the (possibly) new CEO, will never let that happen.

Plus, at this point, since the real short interest is likely to be anywhere from 200% to 900%, they'd have to issue tens, if not hundreds of millions of extra shares in order to save the hedgies. There's simply no way they'd be able to pull that off.

&#x200B;

# F) Sit back and relax

Being long on $GME is literally the easiest thing you could do. You just need to hold! Holding long positions costs nothing and we now know that GameStop is not going bankrupt any time soon. So long positions can literally be held for an infinite amount of time, whereas the shorts pay interest for each short position they have. They can't hold forever. In fact, they probably can't hold much longer at all, in my opinion, considering how many short positions they might have and considering the new DTCC rules that may come into effect soon.

As always, be nice to each other, if you're getting too stressed, turn off your monitor and go do something else.

This is my first attempt at an actual DD, so if there's anything wrong, please let me know. Updoot for visibility :)

-	SEC Awards More Than $9.2 Million to Whistleblower for Successful Related Actions, Including Agreement With DOJ
-	Feb. 23, 2021

Notice the bolded part? The SEC will give you money, doesn’t matter where you live. 

So here’s what you do:

-	Wait until you’re off work
-	Use a computer or phone that your work doesn’t know about. Assume any computer they’ve touched, even ones you’ve just emailed on, are infected with malware and are watching what you do. Literally. Don’t be in the same room as the one you work in when you’re talking to the SEC. Borrow a friend’s, family member’s, or a roommate’s computer. Rent time on one at the public library, etc. Get a burner phone if you can. Communicate exclusively by email or fax if you can’t.
-	Call that number above, or go to the SEC’s website I linked and use one of their other means of communication.
-	This all sounds overly paranoid, but it’s more about preserving the data on your work computer/phone. The less you use it for other things, the less risk the hedgefunds delete everything and kick you out. The data on your work phone/computer is literally gold right now. The SEC investigators will help you figure out how to preserve it and extract all that delicious cash.
-	You’ll want to get in touch with a lawyer to represent you. The lawyer will mostly be to help you navigate the US legal system and organize your whistleblower documents as you assemble them. But also assume you will get sued by your employer. It won’t go anywhere. The contract you signed was illegal in the US before you even signed it.

It sounds daunting, but there’s potentially tens of millions of dollars sitting in your boss’s bank account that could be in yours. Is that worth your time? Think about it.

Edit: If you spot a shill in the wild, link them to this post and [the one with all the actions the SEC has taken against Citadel so far.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4c0p4/citadel_has_no_clothes/) Seriously, just look at any of the fines Citadel has paid out already and imagine what 10% of that would look like sitting in your bank account.

Edit 1: I assume you have monitoring software installed on your device(s) that you agreed to download when you signed up for the job. This is questionably legal, depending on what they’re monitoring and who owns the machine, and might technically be malware. If there’s something scummy you think they might do with that info, assume they’re doing it. If there’s information you’d mind losing, back it up on an external drive or a cloud service. Log off your websites and clear your saved passwords. Switch to a different device for private time browsing. This advice applies even if you aren’t a whistleblower.

TL;DR: Shills, if you’re reading here, you know your boss is fucked. Here’s how to get paid on the way out.",2021-03-22 12:38:16

Why? 

Because when a margin call happens, Shitadel and co need either to provide more collateral for their short positions (which is very costly and risky), or they need to close their short positions.

Either way, the stock price is about to explode, as there are 0 shares left to short, and the buying pressure keeps rising.

Now I wonder how many more GME post like that exist.

I think some of you are missing elephant in the room. As I indicated in my example, there is a proceeding of removing posts of the magnitude that is unknown. Some of those posts present information of significant value and refer to GME itself. This list is incomplete and it is only a sample of an issue.

As I was going through the comments, I saw this from u/traderbabe22 and her words really resonated with me, so I wanted to leverage the popularity of my post to spread her message. 
  
.  
  
Welcome to my 2 cents, from a simple trader and a mom's perspective:  
  
COVID destroyed our primary income. Fortunately, we have made it this long because of my day trading since last summer. Yes. I am a relatively new trader. I didn't know shit about all this stuff last year. But man, WHAT a ride this has been. I've made some mistakes, for sure. Learned the hard way.  
  
But what has happened this last month? This wasn't a matter of just making a trade on bad DD. No, we had good DD. It wasn't just my failure as an investor. Its happened to MILLIONS of traders, seasoned traders, even DFV, not just newbies like me.  
  
For Paper Hands, let me put it this way. I know you can't help but think, ""What does all this matter when they can do illegal shit to screw the little investor over anyway?""  
  
I will say, RH and HFs fooked with the wrong lady! NOW I'm in it to the end.  
  
Let me tell you why:  
  
Like I said, I'm just a mom, a wife and a fairly new investor. And I did pretty well, considering.  
  
And hey....I was just day trading GME for a bit, watching with fascination the talk, and riding the wave. Not in the 'movement', per se. Made $6700 in 2 days for the first time ever.  
  
Cool. Cool.  
  
But then The HALT.  
  
I was completely unprepared for such an unprecedented move. I don't use RH, so I could still buy n sell, but their decision had global ramifications.  
  
THEN, I saw. I SAW what these reddit guys were talking about. Watched it with my own eyes. Hell! I've never been a regular reddit watcher before! But this was the only place I could find the best info. Everywhere else I looked was full of media manipulation.  
  
I watched the daily ladder attacks, the media frenzy, and heard the brokerage firm excuses. Then..... the crooked politicians got in on the game. I knew if they were investigating, its not to protect US. It was to protect THEM. I was just shocked. (Did I say I was new to investing?)  
  
So I woke up. And I got mad. Then I bought more GME. ;)  
  
I am furious at the blatant and aggressive market manipulation, the collusion with big brokers, pissed at my own broker Fidelity for helping to tank the stock at critical juncture with RH.  
  
I'm sick at learning just how badly WallStreet is controlled by market manipulators, and most of all by HFs who short a company stock, and then set out to smear the company they targeted and absolutely destroy businesses for personal gain. Pelosi explained it well when she admitted that politicians do the same thing. Its called the ""Wrap Up Smear"". They know they are lying, manipulating the people, but they dont care. They want to WIN. They want POWER. So they lie, slander and gossip, the media reports the lie as 'fact' and then the politicians use the media to 'prove' their own lies.  
  
""See there? even the news is saying it. It MUST be true.""  
  
This is what HFs do to companies they short. They short a stock, then lie about the company's 'failures' or impending doom. They manipulate, use naked shorts, selling off shares to one another, creating the appearance of mass sell offs, to support their speculation., And most importantly, they use the media to further panic investors, tanking the stock...all the while making $$ while said company goes down in flames.  
  
Now...I have no problem with shorting a stock, IF its done purely on speculation, good DD, and there is no manipulation to create the downfall of that company for giggles n $$. But the illegal or crooked shit is exactly what is happening, ALL the time.  
  
The retail investor is awake. We now SEE and we cant UNsee what we have learned.  
  
And I am forever grateful that my eyes have been opened. I am grateful for the reddit users who have put so much into their research for all of us. I am grateful that I feel more prepared as an investor. Even though this has been monumentally painful and a huge hit for me and my family, I know what to look for. I am no longer a sheep at the mercy of the wolves, completely unaware of their presence or their tactics. I am temporarily poorer, but I am awake. And that is priceless.  
  
Truth is, I'm having online garage sale to help make rent and other debts this month, because even if I sold my GME now, it wouldn't pay my bills. And that $$ would be GONE forever down the bill-hole.  
  
I made good money for a few days. And I went aggressive at $300 right before RH fiasco. Since then, I have bought some on the way down to lower that CB. I have no more money to sink into this after it tanked.  
  
I now have several dozen shares at cost basis over $200.  
  
Hell! I've held on this long, even when it tanked to $38! Clearly, I'm not panic selling.  
  
SO......after all that is said....What is/will be MY GOAL/PRIZE?  
  
Well, I see it this way. This is a once in a lifetime chance to be part of something monumental, market changing, AND to help my family get out of the age old cycle of earn $$, pay bills, earn $$ pay bills.  
  
And yes, I also want to stick it to the criminals and end this shit. Crooked HFs too big to fail? Really?  
  
Nah. They are going to have to cover their shorts, at some point or another.  
  
But hey, if the BIG squeeze doesn't happen, I'm still holding my shares. I've moved on to making $$ other ways, and not depending on the squeeze.  
  
When it happens, it happens. And it will change my family's future forever, because I held out for top $$.  
  
If it doesn't, I will let my portfolio grow organically over time, because I believe GME can become the #1 Gaming destination, online and off, IN THE WORLD. Squeeze or no, GME base price is soon going to be well over $300 with Ryan Cohen n team on board.  
  
So hell yeah, I'm HOLDING.  
  
What is it Mr. Wonderful always says? Your money should have little baby dollars, and they should make more baby dollars.  
  
I think GME squeeze could be legacy making $$. Generational $$ MAKING $$.  
  
I'm riding this to the moon!!  
  
Squeeze or no.  
  
DISCLAIMER: I am a MOM, not a financial advisor. Do what you want. These are only my thoughts, NOT financial advice  

TL/DR: Mom pissed, lost almost all my portfolio. Barely hanging in there, but I'm STILL holding, for my family's future and damn, just on principle. I'm sick of cheaters.

Form ADV? Among other things, contains the most up to date information on any registered investor of firm and can be 100+ pages long. One can normally obtain the form here (scroll to bottom search bar): [https://www.investor.gov/CRS](https://www.investor.gov/CRS) 

**When:**

However, as of this morning (mar 27, 2021) it’s been disabled. I have been using this site wo issue for a  l o n g  time so to see this gov.’t web search _suddenly stop working_ **raises no red flags**. I did post about the good intel that you can find on this form about hedge funds for the first time 6days ago and it was working fine then too

Good times people /s

Anyone happen to have the link to Citadel’s form adv for a trade? (Edit: you guys have since found a few for me to look thru, thank you!)

However, also I think it will help identify what needs to be addressed and prioritized first  i say this recognizing there’s a black hole of important information we can’t get access to but, I think we could start first, then cross that bridge when we get to it.

Let's talk about that with simple math.,1620438452.0,"Current amount of dogecoin in circulation: 129 billion

Daily amount of Dogecoin entering in circulation: 14.4 million (10.000 per minute)

Now, for the fun part:

new coins per day / circulating x 100 = % inflation per day

14.4m / 129b x 100 = 0,01116% inflation per day or 4,07% APR aka 4.07% year/inflation

&#x200B;

Now, let's do this same operation with the US dollar and I'm gonna use a governmental source to do this ([https://www.uscurrency.gov/life-cycle/data/circulation](https://www.uscurrency.gov/life-cycle/data/circulation)):

Most recent data is from 2019 so I'll take 2019 vs. 2018 for this comparison. Amount of notes/bills of different denominations (in billions):

[$500 to $10.000 bills are left out because no precise information is provided, then again the amount of those bills is so small we can confidently assume its impact is negligible](https://preview.redd.it/tj51urdpgqx61.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=34df5a6a381f60bf370d972fe3e0d2ac66060850)

Now, we just have to multiply the amount of each bill with the correspondent value and we get this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n5qt1d9eiqx61.png?width=2452&format=png&auto=webp&s=995e21a711b664e4dfd9999b588fbd490caf5ad9

Now the difference between 2019 and 2018 is: 1752,3 - 1668,5 which equals to: 83,8

So, new B dollars per year / circulating B x 100 = % inflation per year: 83,8 x 100 / 1668,5 = 5,022%

**US Dollar vs Dogecoin (Inflation)**

**5,02% --- 4,07%**

**So, the truth is the Federal Reserve is diluting the value of the US Dollar FASTER than Dogecoin.**

**Finally, dogecoin's inflation will decrease over time as there are more coins circulating vs the same amount of new doge introduced every year (5,256 billion). So, by 2022, Doge's inflation will be less than 4% and will keep slowly going down.**

Here are my takeaways.,1617338961.0,"I'm embarrassed that it took me this long to realize that Matt F was the same person I worked with, as I assumed the name was a coincidence. But since we're obviously in a simulation, I guess I wasn't too surprised when I saw his pic in the LinkedIn post today and did a huge double-take.

I'll cut to the chase:

* He's incredibly level-headed and calm. No big, boisterous personality — he shows up to get shit done
* That said, he's nice about it. I know that's a lame way of putting it, but the combo of someone who wants to get down to brass tacks AND create a healthy work environment can be tough to find in leadership (in the Seattle tech market, anyway)
* He led a pretty risky transformation while we worked together — although it wasn't a customer-facing change, customers would have been massively impacted if it would have failed, and the company would have suffered big time. Sorry for the vagueness (usual reasons) but the point is, it went smoothly thanks to him — and the aspect that looked like it wasn't going to go smoothly? We set it aside, came up with an alternate plan, and the big picture all came together flawlessly in the end. 

I think Matt's energy will be ideal for GameStop's transformation. No one wants to rely on corporate PR fluff about company direction, so I have confidence knowing Matt's the one ultimately leading the execution. I know how he operates day-to-day and I can assure you (if nothing's changed) that he'll be transparent with dev teams, involved in the weeds, and won't pull any punches when it comes to telling the other execs what needs to be done.

Happy to provide proof to mods but guessing I haven't said anything important enough anyway, ha. That's a good thing though! Strong hire with no known skeletons.

[Ryan Grim And Wall St Whistleblower Claim Banks Engaged In SYSTEMIC FRAUD In Commercial Real Estate](https://youtu.be/pRHwhvUc54A)

So I was scrolling through the abyss of YouTube and came across this video that was posted on **April 20th** this year. After watching it I was both shocked but also **JACKED TO THE TITS!**

Basically, Ryan Grim and whistleblower John Flynn explain that banks have resorted to the same tactics used in the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, but are doing it through the Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities Market (CMBS).

From what I understand from the video, the lenders (banks) are massively inflating income from commercial properties (retailers) on their documentation, before selling the mortgages on the CMBS market at a higher price. This causes the buyers of these mortgages to think they are legitimate when in fact, the income from these properties can be nowhere near what the banks recorded on their documentation.

Grim says that this is great for everyone involved, **AS LONG AS THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW AND REAL ESTATE PRICES CONTINUE TO RISE.**

I think that is the most important statement of this entire video and also where I think $GME starts to come into play.

In the last couple of weeks, we have seen a huge increase in banks raising liquidity while at the same time the SEC is investigating naked short selling in hedge funds as related to the January $GME short squeeze. Why do banks need the liquidity you might ask? Because they know that overleveraged hedge funds are on the verge of being exposed and are likely to be margin-called in the near future.

**""But the economy is at all-time highs, tech is booming"", and that is exactly the problem.**

If Citadel or other large hedge funds begin to fail, we are going to start seeing a massive sell-off in tech and the entire market in general. A massive market sell-off could cause investors to move to real estate, but wait, the CMBS mortgage prices are massively overinflated and nobody knows about it right now, then what happens? Well, I don't know for sure, but **I think it would be pretty fucked.**

I also believe that there is a possibility that banks may have been doing this for a while now, but the problem probably became much worse in the last year with COVID forcing almost all retailers to shut down, seizing income. In order to find buyers of these commercial mortgages for retailers that were shut down by COVID and otherwise unattractive to investors, why not inflate their income now to find a buyer for the mortgage, COVID isn't gonna last forever, the businesses will recover eventually and no one will find out, as long as the market keeps growing, right?

WRONG. VERY WRONG. What if hedge funds expose themselves to massive risk through naked shorting and are forced to sell all of their positions to cover themselves? That would be a problem.

***What if the bubble that the market is in right now is a result of the fraud committed by lenders massively overinflating retailer incomes in the CMBS market during COVID and $GME is the catalyst to expose the short squeeze 2.0 after hedge funds are margin-called, triggering a broad market sell-off of all stocks?***

If my wild, smooth-brained, crayon-fueled conspiracy theory is even somewhat true, I think we apes may have uncovered something much deeper than GameStop, a scary possibility that the entire house of cards may fall right before our eyes.

This could be worse than 2008 and I think that is the scariest part. Nobody was held accountable for the criminality committed on Wall Street in 2008, so why should we expect that they learned their lesson? They clearly just moved the same tactics to a different type of security and are probably doing the exact same thing again.

You can't teach an old dog new tricks, so why should we expect hedgies and Wall St to play by the rules when they have broken them time and time again with no consequences? We can't.

Please give the video a watch, it is only at 177K views and I do not believe that it has been getting the attention it deserves. This could be huge.

TLDR: no, just read it you fuck.

Edit TLDR: **There is a strong possibility that the same tactics that caused the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis are being used in the same way in the Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities Market currently, and a $GME short squeeze that potentially crashes the stock market could spill over to the real estate market, eventually exposing fraudulent over-inflation of retailer income in the CMBS market in commercial properties reported by lenders (banks), ultimately leading to distrust in the entire American economy as we know it, leading to an inevitable recession with increasing retail investor distrust in the efficiency of our supposed ""free markets"".**

Sorry for the long post, I have a lot to say.

FULL DISCLAIMER: I am just some guy who has read tons of all the wonderful due diligence posted on r/GME and r/WallStreetBets over the past three months, especially by the likes of u/rensole and u/HeyItsPixel (if you either of you two want to look over what follows and poke holes or offer insight, I’d much appreciate it). All this reading has added some very fine wrinkles in my brain and I’d like to share with you all how I think this is going to play out over the coming weeks (yes I said WEEKS). This is just my opinion and in no way is any financial advice. Do your own research. If you have questions, counter theories, holes in my logic, please add it to the comments. I will try to address it.

First things first, I don’t want to be called a shill. I am a real person who’s mostly been lurking on this sub but I’ve begun to speak up a little more and more.

To hopefully prove to you I’m not a shill this is me:

LinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/clmoffatt/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clmoffatt/)

Twitter: @ clmoffatt (I rarely tweet)

Website: clmoffatt.com (I post a blog entry about once every four years, LOL)

Why remove my anonymity? I have some speculation later in this post that MAY appear to some to be fear, uncertainty, doubt (FUD). I still want to say these things. I don’t want these things to be dismissed out of hand because I think it offers value so I want to say it. I also don’t want to be called a shill because I am not. Maybe doing this will garner a little trust for me on your part.

I’ve worked in and out of the financial industry for the last 13 years (writing software). I worked for one of the largest clearing firms in Chicago from ’08 – ’12. I also just recently finished a contract (almost three full years) with a large pension fund manager at the end of January. And just for a little extra spice, I was interviewed by Citadel for an open contract position, for which thankfully, I did not get.

All this being said, I am in no way a financial expert and I’m not claiming to be one. I just have been on the inside and seen how the sausage is made. I have a few more wrinkles on the brain than your average ape which is why I want to share my thoughts with the rest of you, beautiful diamond-handed apes.

Before we start, I want to define the players so it is easier to refer to them within this post.

· Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) – think of this entity as the clearing firm for the clearing firms. When I worked for a clearing firm, we cleared all of our daily activity through the DTCC.

· Shorting Hedge Funds (SHFs) – these are the hedge funds that are trying to drive GameStop to bankruptcy so they can make a quick, tax-free buck, while causing an American business to fail while costing thousands of people their jobs. They are doing this by taking massive short positions in GameStop. These are Citadel, Melvin Capital, and I’m sure many, many others.

· Long Whales (LWs) – these are other hedge funds and institutions that are bullish on GameStop and are taking long positions in the stock. These whales have huge deep pockets with lots of capital at their disposal. They are looking to make billions from this GME play and in the process bankrupt many of their key competitors in the process, namely Citadel.

· Retail Investors (RI) – any regular person with a brokerage account who wants to invest in GameStop on their own. This could be people with hundreds of dollars to some who have millions, maybe more.

· Redditors – a subset of the retail investor group that are providing valuable research, due diligence, and humor during this saga. I love all of you diamond-handed apes.

So, Friday went down pretty much how I thought it would.

Please read my Friday post, I don’t think it was read by enough of you.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3egk7/be\_patient\_and\_trust\_the\_process/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3egk7/be_patient_and_trust_the_process/)

I said it would be likely that Friday would have GME finish flat or down for the day. Now up 6% on the day is hardly flat but the overall sentiment of the post still stands. The LWs wanted as many of the out-of-money call options being held by the SHFs to be worthless by the end of the day (reasons explained in the linked post).

We now have the same situation again for this week. I believe the SHFs have lots of call options expiring this Friday in the price range from the current price all the way up to $800.

The SHFs and LWs are now playing a game of chicken. Who’s going to blink first? It doesn’t matter because the LWs and RIs can hold forever because it isn’t costing either of these groups anything. It’s costing the SHFs millions of dollars to continue kicking the can down the road. The SHFs bought tons of options contracts between $300 and $800 expiring both last Friday and this coming Friday. The LWs noticed and countered, “fine, I’ll make that play worthless.” The SHFs tanked the price last Wednesday, the LWs and RIs bought the dip and raised that price right back up to the opening price for the day.

It’s almost as if the LWs are saying to the SHFs for every attack you have, we have a counter-measure. Your demise will be at a time and place of our choosing, quit f-ing around and take your lumps.

I wish I could find that brilliant post from last Friday that I read about how the Thursday closing price was significant because it allowed the for the trading of options expiring the next day. This was a huge light bulb moment for me and I’ll explain its significance in a bit.

So, this is how I see the end game playing out.  This is what I would do if I was the LWs.

I would try and keep GME under $400 for the week ($300 if they can pull it off but with the stimmy money coming that may not be possible). This again makes the SHFs many, many call options worthless, costs them millions of dollars in lost premiums, millions of dollars in short interest to continue to hold short, and ultimately denies them access to the precious shares.

Why not just pop this thing off this coming week and get it over with? Because those LWs want all of dat toothpaste (seriously, go read my post from Friday if you haven’t) and because two significant developments happen the week after.

The first significant development is the new DTCC rules go into effect for the following week. All the entities that use the DTCC are also responsible for its solvency. If you’re a LW, and you kick off the mother-of-all-squeezes (MOASS) BEFORE those rules go into effect, well you are kind of shooting yourself in the foot. Why do that? Just wait a week, bleed the SHFs some more, get all of that toothpaste.

The second significant development is that GameStop is having its Q4 earnings call after EOD Tuesday, March 23. I fully expect this earnings report to be bananas great for GameStop way exceeding the expectations. GameStop shed/closed many poor performing locations, they are reorganizing the leadership, they are pivoting the business. These are all the reasons why I think GameStop is a good buy despite any squeeze. Throw on top the fact that the next generation consoles dropped for both Xbox and Playstation in Q4 and most everyone got a $600 stimulus check in that same time frame. If you were fortunate enough to keep your job through the pandemic and also went to full-time remote, in most likelihood your expense dropped significantly to just the essentials, rent, food, utilities, etc. but your income stayed the same. Plenty of discretionary cash just sitting in bank accounts. All these people were also stuck at home with not much to do, why not buy one of the next gen consoles and play some video games. I’m a PC gamer myself, but I too played lots of games during the pandemic.

I think the earnings call will be really positive and GME will pop big time on Wednesday.

Why is waiting for after the earnings call good for the LWs? Plausible deniability ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible\_deniability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability)). When all of this has played out, there is going to be A LOT of finger pointing and claims of market manipulation. Hell, this is already starting to happen. I think we can all agree that the SHFs have definitely been manipulating the stock price of GME. I also think though that the LWs have been manipulating it as well to play out their end game strategy how they want. If the LWs wait until after the earnings call and the stock’s subsequent ‘pop’, they can just say the earnings call was fantastic, that made everyone even more bullish on the stock. This is what caused the price to go up. It wasn’t us manipulating the market.

This ‘pop’ I feel will just be too much upward pressure on the stock and that the gamma squeeze will begin that Friday, March 26th with the MOASS happening the following week or the week after that.

This is how I think the LWs are going to kick off the gamma squeeze. A few paragraphs ago, I mentioned about being able to trade options contracts the day they are expiring. This is where it will come into play. I was watching the options chain on Friday for contracts expiring by the end of the day. As the day wears on, these out of the money (OTM) options become next to worthless. I saw $600 strike price call option contracts trading at $0.06 around noon (that’s right six cents). By the end of the day, anyone holding these contracts are practically trying to give them away. In fact, I held two call contracts expiring EOD Friday that sold off early in the day to try and recoup what I could. I took a significant loss on them but better to get something for a thing that is going to be worthless at the end of the day. I didn’t get back my full clip of ammunition but I got back a few of the bullets. I’ll be able to use these during the end game.

Now I think last Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday was the LWs ‘dry-run’ for how they are going to play this out. They knew at some point all those shorted shares the SHFs were borrowing were going to drop at once. The SHFs made this play on Wednesday and the LWs and RI countered.

The SSR was very obviously tripped on purpose early Thursday putting it into effect for the rest of Thursday and all of Friday. While I feel the SSR is significant, it isn’t necessary to pull this off, it just makes it easier to do so. I’ve read a bunch of DD on the SSR and its significance and it appears that the stock can still be manipulated and shorted even with the SSR in effect. Like I said, it just makes it tougher to do so with the SSR in force.

The key trying to get the GME to close on Thursday which allows for the trading of expiring option contracts the next day. If we see this again (my guess would be March 25th), my ears are definitely going to perk up and the hair on my neck will be at full attention.

So, with the SSR in place and the ability to trade same day expiring contracts, the stage will be set for the gamma squeeze. With the SSR in place, the SHFs will have a difficult time executing one last ditch effort at tanking the stock like they did last Wednesday. With the ability to same day trade expiring contracts, the LWs will start buy all of these up on the cheap because those holding the contracts don’t want to be bag holders. They will now hold thousands of seemingly worthless OTM contracts. But these contracts are soon not going to be worthless. They’re going to be worth diamonds. They will have access a shit-ton of actual shares for next to nothing. The LWs will then just start buying and buying. I’d expect volume to go just crazy right here. The stock price will rise causing more and more of their ‘worthless’ contracts to be in the money (ITM). This causes the option holder to cough up the shares and if they were ‘naked‘ options, they now have to buy them at the current price, increasing demand, increasing the price, vicious feedback loop. BOOM GAMMA SQUEEZE.

This gamma squeeze then kicks off the MOASS for the following week (or the week after). This part I’m not a definitive on because I don’t know how much upward pressure it’s going to take to trip the MOASS. It really doesn’t matter though because it’s going to happen.

Now for what I see as two potential monkey wrenches (maybe we call them ape wrenches) that could alter this endgame.

First, the stimmy checks. You diamond-handed apes are going to be handed fresh bananas. I’m sure many of you are going to use those bananas to buy more GME stock. I say good for you, you beautiful smooth-brained ape. Trade bananas for stock, sell stock to get many, many tendies. I like that trade. I just honestly don’t know what kind of upward pressure this is going to put on the GME stock. It may cause it to ‘pop’ too soon. Either way, it’s not a necessarily a bad thing to ‘pop’ early, it’s just not ideal. I think it is better for everyone who will still be standing (including the DTCC and our government) if this happens after March 19th.

Second ape wrench being how much these shares are going to be worth. This is the part where some may accuse me of spreading FUD. That is not my intention but I want you to be aware of this because it’s a real possibility. We’re going to get paid, of that I’m certain. It’s just going to be a question of how much.

If the SHFs refuse to cover their shorts, their brokerage (if using one) will liquidate their other positions to raise capital to begin covering their short positions. The brokerage will do this when the margin calls for holding those positions becomes untenable (the week after the gamma squeeze). If the brokerage cannot liquidate enough to cover, then the clearing firm they use will do the same thing to them, liquidating the brokerage’s other positions to close out the shorts. This is what will happen to the market makers (MMs) shorting as well. Their clearing firm (CF) will liquidate their other positions to cover their shorts. If the clearing firms, cannot completely cover all of the shorts with the liquidated positions, then the DTCC will do the same thing to the clearing firms that cannot cover. The DTCC has very, very deep pockets and a crazy insurance policy for this sort of thing. However, if the DTCC cannot cover all of the shorts, I guess it will once again fall to the American people to cover for Wall Street’s risky behavior. It’s going to be a shit show for sure.

So, what are these shares going to be worth? Theoretically, these shares will have infinite value. The SHFs (and by extension the MMs, CFs, and DTCC) HAVE TO BUY them from the LWs and the RIs. By some estimates I’ve seen about how much of the float is being shorted, the SHFs will HAVE TO BUY these shares multiple times. I’m convinced that AT LEAST 200% of the float has been shorted. I’ve seen estimates that it could be as high as 900%. WE JUST DO NOT KNOW. Think about that, the SHFs will have to buy the entire float not once but twice at a price set by the LWs and RIs.

This is where it gets interesting. You apes have been so conditioned to HODL for these past three months (many of you even longer). The less supply of shares (because everyone’s still holding) the more worth the limited shares available becomes. If the prices (and I do mean IF, a big f-ing IF), gets too ‘crazy’ the government MAY have to step in and sort all of this out. They MAY have to say every share is worth $X dollars and then we get paid based on this arbitrary figure. For me personally, anything less than $2,000,000 a share would be a slap in the face. Yes, $2MM a share is my new floor.

What’s a ‘crazy’ price? I haven’t a clue. But I think there is a number out there where this event could get triggered.  Just something to ponder. I do really believe that it is in the best interest of the U.S. government to let the market play out and then just bail out if necessary. It would be really damaging to the markets if the government stepped in and said all shares are worth $X.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

I know predictions are looked down upon on this subreddit but I’m going to make of few because I believe them to be logical and well researched. In no way is any of this a certainty and if it doesn’t happen on the exact dates specified doesn’t mean it isn’t going to happen. The squeeze will happen. This is just my reading of the tea leaves.

I believe GME will trade mostly sideways this upcoming week. We’ll see red days and green days but I’d expect the price to stay below $400 through the week.

The week of 22nd will see the new DTCC rules go into effect and GME has its earnings call. This earnings call will cause a ‘pop’ in the price creating upward pressure for the end of that week. The long whales will attempt to trigger the gamma squeeze on the 26th.

MOASS occurs either the week of the 29th or the week after.

Just HODL you filthy apes.

BEGIN SOAPBOX RANT

If you’ve made it this far please indulge me while I get on my soapbox and speak to the bigger implications of what’s about to occur.

I am going to be speaking strictly from an American perspective because it is what I’m immersed within and what I know the most. For any non-Americans, what I’m about to say may be applicable to what’s going on in your country as well. So, when I use terms like society going forward, I’m specifically speaking about it from the American perspective but it definitely is applicable to the whole world.

What is going down with GME isn’t much different with what happened in 2008.

Why does this ‘shit’ keep happening again, and again, and again, and again.

Accountability. Such a simple word. For far too long we as a society have not been holding those in power accountable for their immoral, unethical, and criminal behavior. Whether it is the corrupt politician, the crooked business man, or the police that oppress and murder our fellow citizens.

When we don’t hold the bad actors in our society accountable, it only emboldens them to do worse the next time. The thought being, “Well, I got away with it that time, what more can I get away with.” But in fact, we’re even worse than apathy toward holding the bad actors accountable. We reward them. We continually elect and reelect corrupt politicians, we give tax payer money to crooked businessmen who then pay themselves fat bonuses, we shield bad police from prosecution while awarding them with fat pensions.

One person, ONE PERSON, went to jail over the 2008 meltdown. Wall Street took exceptionally risky bets out of pure greed, those bets were bad bets and failed bets but we were all left holding their bag. Not only did none of them go to jail, some of them became even more wealthy.

I don’t care if you’re on the right side of the political spectrum or on the left side. Take a long hard look at our society and take a good long look in the mirror. If you’re honest with yourself, truly, brutally honest, you know what I am saying is correct. The ‘system’ is broken. It has been for probably 40 years. One of the biggest reasons it is broken is because no one is held accountable for their bad deeds.

The people that caused this mess need to be held accountable. They need to be criminally prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for the fraud they’ve committed. Failure to do so will only result in another ‘crises’ like this happening again.

I am hopeful, ever so hopeful that some real change will come out of these events when it has all finally transpired. I want to live in a different society, one not run by greed and profit, but one ruled by compassion and love. There is enough abundance in this world for everyone to share and prosper. What type of world would you rather inhabit?

I WAS TOLD ITS NOT A DD WITHOUT ROCKETS🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

ID LIKE TO PREFACE BY SAYING I AM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR NOR IS THIS FINANCIAL ADVICE. PLEASE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND MAKE YOUR OWN INVESTMENTS BASED ON THAT RESEARCH.

That being said here we go.

The DTCC has released new rules that essentially will split the bill with hedges and clearing houses etc. Now even the NSCC is trying to put out rules to split their bill too. The NSCC new rulings are set for 4/21. Time is running out for the companies to cover losses, THE DTCC, NSCC and more.

Why?

Mid March they found out the entire market is a fucking ticking time bomb waiting to explode. The US govt literally handed free money to hedges to stimulate the economy during the pandemic. That was the hedges job during the virus. Now on the 31st coming up that money is gone, no more, the rule is expiring and they won't be funded anymore. (Unless extended)

Who are they?

The DTCC is essentially the worlds largest bank give or take handling over 90% of all existing US money. They are the only people who receive ALL MARKET DATA meaning they don't have to guess about anything they have every bit of info they need on these hedges positions.

Why would they do this?

There's massive upside for many many stocks bc of the amount of free money pumped into hedges during the pandemic. This of course went to shorting an absolutely shit ton of stocks as we all know. Then the stimulus checks have essentially pumped more money into the hands of individuals then there has ever been before. This combined with the hedges free money disappearing the 31st can cause massive damage to the DTCC possibly for more than they are willing to depart with.

How do we know hedges are in danger?

Goldman Sachs has margin called Archegos and liquidated over billions of dollars in assets for underlying positions. This margin call is ONE OF THE LARGEST MARGIN CALLS IN HISTORY. Archegos  had high stakes in Chinese companies and US Media networks. For an example of what liquidation does to a stock refer yourself to VIACOM the price has drop over 50% in days due to liquidating positions. (Possible Distraction?)

What does it all mean?

IMO we've managed to scare the largest bank in the world, THE DTCC, they see their wellbeing at risk and are acting as fast as possible to split the bill with as many people as possible before shit really hits the fan and stocks like AMC/GME have INNNSAAAANE UPSIDE POTENTIAL come to be realized.

Hello Apes -

I know that in the past, we've discussed briefly contacting media personalities to combat the narrative of the (bought) Main Stream Media.  I think this is an important angle we should explore.

When I woke up, I read through the new DD and the posts from u/heyitspixel & u/rensole about the troll/shill campaign that seems to be threatening their lives.  At the very least, this is fucking with their heads, and I cannot stand by and let this happen without considering using the power we have in numbers to combat this fuckery.

I propose this.  I've done some research on who might be best to contact regarding this whole situation.  They all have Twitter, and they all can be influenced publicly with a Twitter storm of messages.

**\*** I realize there are probably many many more.   I suspect that if we can create a big enough list of potential journalists to tweet at with a significant amount of our DD and evidence that we can attract at least ONE suitor.  I'd be happy to add to the list since I think the more the merrier.  Please feel free to suggest an edit.

**\*\* I'm not biased here politically... I don't care what media venue or personality we include in this storm.  The more eyes the better...**

# What is my goal?

Exposure.  WHY?  Well, WIN LOSE OR DRAW in our mission to the moon, these fuckers need to have this shit outed.  People need to be engaged and NOT just us apes.  The plebs who are losing money with the hedgfunds through their pensions, the people who can't afford a fractional share of GME.

# How do we proceed?

We compile all the best evidence from the wrinkle brain repository.  Dark Pool Trading, FTDs, SEC do-nothings, Congressional Shillery, Hedgefund Fuckery, Troll Army Attacks, & Paid Social Media Shillery.

Someone with a better skill of prose should craft a short plea and EVERYONE here with a Twitter account send a tweet to all targets including all the independent journalist we know on YouTube & Twitter.  WE PUT PRESSURE ON THE THEM TO SPEAK.  Nearly all of these outlets are viewer-funded.  The MeMe stock saga is MUST WATCH content.  For them this will be an opportunity of a lifetime.

**Media Outlets to Target:**  Joe Rogan, Jimmy Dore, The Young Turks, John Stossel, John Oliver, The Intercept, The Daily Poster, SubStack, The Daily Show, The Hill (Rising), 60 minutes, 20/20, Project Veritas, StockSleuth, ICJU, BuzzFeed News

EDIT 1:  Added two more potential targets.

EDIT 2:  As far as media outlets, I think the obligatory Joe Rogan, Jimmy Dore, John Oliver, are important.  They may not pick it up, but they have a ton of Twitter followers.

EDIT 3: Added more targets, including lawyers for cases against Citadel.  Adding a media outlet section we can spam for pressure.

EDIT INFINITY:  Jesus H... I'll be doing this all day. LOL.

YOU ARE HELPING THEIR MARGIN.,1617238020.0,"This is going to be quite a long arse post. Most of what I am going to say is going to sound slightly negative. I myself am all in on GME. At the current price point I have almost doubled my money. Am I selling? No. Do I believe in the squeeze as much as ever? Yes. But in every war you learn to hear both sides. It is only healthy to fully understand what's going on so you can better plan your moves.

None of this is financial advice. This is just one apes interpretation and understanding of what is going on. Do your own DD. Buy or sell without listening to others. But in a hypothetical world if a squeeze was to happen for XX stock this is what I would advise.

TLDR; Buy and Hold **SHARES**. contact your representatives. The SEC, etc. you may think what can 1 person do. but ape together strong. It's easy to ignore 1 or even 10 people. But hundreds, thousands, constantly? No.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before I start let me say this again. The last time I said this I got downvoted to hell and called shill. But I shall reiterate. Kenny G and Co. are smarter than most of us. Hell they are probably more conniving than most of the world in all aspects. This is even more so the case when it comes to the financial markets. This is their domain. Know your enemy. You can hate them, not respect them, but until the war is done and won, acknowledge their abilities at playing this game. regardless of what illegal means are being employed. Only in that way can apes together think level headedly and fight smartly.

\*\*If they are so smart how did they end up in this situation?\*\*It happens to the smartest of people. But in my opinion how did January happen? Lack of respect for the abilities of apes. As simple as that. Even as things got progressively worse for them towards the end of 2020, they still could never fathom the retardation of apes, they still thought they could crush apes. Why? The question should by why wouldn't they? They were bringing in record profits even during the pandemic by doing what they always did. Life was easy. They were on autopilot mode. They had previously brought corporations to their knees. Crushed them to the ground and made huge profits. If they could do that to large corporations with 100s of millions to fight against them, why in the world would they even consider apes a threat? Long story short they got caught with their pants down when apes went into frenzy in Jan and this being a new phenomenon, they did not have any contingency plan in place. Everything was done of the fly and they couldn't scramble together to stem the tide.

\*\*How is this different now?\*\*Now they have a game plan. There has been more than enough time for them to come up with something. You best believe if they can't do it they would have hired and gotten help from the best in the world to come up with something. They also could have bribed people. They could have blackmailed some sod in the SEC with incriminating photos. They could threaten someone's kid's education, etc. They have their tentacles all the way up the highest levels of the system. These aren't conspiracy theories.. **Hundreds of Billions are at stake**. You could murder someone in the U.S. for less than a few 100k. You best believe there is some high level fkery on going behind the scenes. These are titans of the industry, you best believe they are doing everything to stay on top. **But don't forget most uprisings and revolutions are brought about by the people having enough of it. Even the biggest dynasties can crumble to the might of the people.** At the end of the day, these are all speculations and just some of the myriad of tactics they might use. I'm here to talk about the things I can say to a high degree of certainty about the tactics they are employing with options and why we should not touch them with a 10 foot pole.

**Citadel LLC**I keep seeing posts talking about Citadel as if they are only a hedge fund. Fck me. if that is all they were, this would have been long over.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel\_LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC)

""**Citadel LLC** (formerly known as **Citadel Investment Group, LLC**) is an American multinational [hedge fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_fund) and [financial services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services) company. Founded in 1990 by [Kenneth Griffin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_C._Griffin), the company operates two primary businesses: Citadel, one of the world's largest alternative asset managers with more than [US$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$)35 billion in assets under management (as of October 1, 2020);[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC#cite_note-3) and **Citadel Securities, one of the leading** [**market makers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker) **in the world, whose trading products include** [**equities**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock)**,** [**equity options**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_(finance))**, and interest rate swaps for retail and institutional clients.""**

They are one of the biggest market makers in the world. This is the fking issue. What are market makers you ask? the description itself explains it. Simple apes always be speaking as if Citadel is just a Hedge fund and they may be colluding with market makers to do all their option shenanigans and why would market makers want to risk doing that.The thing is **THEY DONT HAVE TO.** FFS they are both the hedge fund and the market maker. How fked up is that? This is the type of beast that we are up against. This is Hidden dungeon final boss levels of magnitude (**which is why once defeated, the loot will be legendary**). But by no means is this going to be an easy process

""Citadel Securities is the largest market maker in options in the U.S., executing about 25 percent of U.S.-listed equity options volume.[\[53\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citadel_LLC#cite_note-53) According to the *Wall Street Journal*, about one-third of stock orders from individual investors is completed through Citadel, which accounts for about 10% of the firm's revenue""

Ok now to my main point about options. It annoys me to the max when others post ""DD"" on the options chain, option positions, their opinions on what happens if we end at xx amt. Half of these apes don't understand the basics of how delta hedging works. The worst misconception that people keep having is that Friday is always exciting. it isn't. Its the most boring day. Don't take my word. open up your chart. Look at **EVERY SINGLE FRIDAY** since January. Find me a single Friday in which we have had big positive movements? In fact the opposite is more true. We often trade sideways if not downwards on a Friday. The big movements usually occur midweek. Market makers aren't ""hedging"" everything at one go as the prices hit certain levels on a Friday. That doesn't even make sense.. that isn't even hedging anymore lol. If people want more explanations on how this works I am happy to go into further detail but for now I'll leave it at that.

\*\*So why are options bad?\*\*Options aren't bad. I love options. This is a casino. with other stocks its a fun roller coaster.**But for GME it fkin hell sure is bad.** As show above. who writes your options? Who has all your option positions? all the DD fellow apes here post on options, lacks something. The overall picture of **WHO OWNS WHAT OPTIONS AT WHAT EXACT STRIKES.** people keep hypothesizing that we are perhaps bein helped by friendly whales so that we are causing them max pain.. but from the start I have said that they are the ones that may be the ones causing us max pain. let me explain how and the context behind why I believe so based on these premises:

1. They have maphack. They can basically see everyone's positions. They know where their friendlies stand, where their enemies stand.
2. They have the ability to do naked shorting and they still have some funds in their war chest left
3. Apes have limited funds in our war chest left to create big price movements (I for one am such a person, already all in)
4. Their ability to manipulate price in their favor, dollar to dollar is greater than an apes through manipulation of the system and use of algorithms to game the system (by this I mean if ape spend 100k on stock maybe price go up 3 dollars. If hedgie spend 100k might be able to drop the price by 10 dollars)

This is why Fridays almost never go in our favor. Even if we try to put a positive spin on things when we end at certain price, to be honest we never know if this is the exact price they wanted it to end at. **EVEN IF THE PRICE GOES UP A DECENT AMOUNT IT MAY ALSO BE WHAT THEY WANT**. Let me explain why this is so.

\- lets say Hedgie has 500millions in losses because he shorted GME at 50 dollars and the price is now 100 dollars

\- Hedgie has everyone's options positions. So he looks at where all the enemies calls are positioned. lets say there is a fk tonne of ape calls at 150strike.

\- Hedgie says ok lets buy a lot of 130strike call options

\- Hedgie doesn't spend the week heavily shorting GME. He just controls the price movements and shorts it when needed to make sure momentum doesn't get out of hand and saves all his gunpowder for friday. Lets the price slowly climb through the week from 100 to around 145

\- Apes are happy cause price is going up, thinks we are winning. TO THE MOON. buy more options cause stock seems bullish. Wont sell options for profit because DIAMOND HANDOS

\- Hedgies know this. the movement is about DIAMOND HANDS (**which is even worse when it comes to options because then they might not even delta hedge your options because they know they are going to drive the price below that and you aren't going to sell your options for profit beforehand because diamond handsss - I'm not saying dont diamond hands. but fk if you do that for options they are going to use it against you. do it with SHARES SHARES SHARES. NOT OPTIONS. DONT PLAY OPTIONS)**

\- So come friday. Hedgies drive the price to end at 140 or 141 or 142. Their short position has risen to 900million in loses from the 40 dollar increase in price. **BUT THEY EAT ALL THE MONEY FROM THE 150 AND ABOVE STRIKE PRICE OPTIONS PLUS THEY MAKE BANK FROM THEIR OWN 130STRIKE OPTIONS.** As long as these amounts > then the 400mil extra the suffered from the increase in price which is definitely the case, **Their margin position gets better and better if they rinse and repeat this week after week.** **which is why they probably still have not gotten margin called. They are more likely the ones causing us MAX PAIN than the other way round.**

The vice versa is true if they choose to buy put options instead of call options.

This is my hypothesis of why the price fluctuates between the 100-300 dollar range. they are fucking with apes who are buying options and stealing their money, all the while giving them a better and better margin difference each week from the profits.

I myself have had options which were up 300%. I have diamond handed that shit to hell and it expired worthless. Lucky most of my holdings in GME were actual shares.

\*\*So what advice do I have to counter this for fellow apes? (this is not financial advice)\*\*If you are currently holding options... **SELL THEM and BUY SHARES.** you are simply being played with options. you may end up winning a little here and there but as a whole, you just got lucky because you were not at a position where the HF wanted to drive the price to. Because not enough apes and friendlies were at that strike price to matter to them. But options are already risky enough as it is. Add in HF fukery and its not worth it at all anymore. CITADEL IS THE ONE SELLING YOU THE OPTIONS. you think they sell it to you knowing they gonna lose it? Also options on GME are so fking expensive. I burned like 10 - 20k on them in the earlier days because I diamond handed that shit when I could've just bought more shares and diamond handed that shit instead and have no worries.

I have said this in other posts, but only as comments. **RIGHT NOW THEY ARE IN CONTROL OF THE PRICE. WE HAVE LITTLE SAY IN IT UNLESS THERE IS SOME BIG CATALYST. OR UNTIL THE SQUEEZE HAPPENS AND A FEW DAYS BEFORE THAT. BUT THE PRICE DOES NOT MATTER. YOU COUNTER EVERYTHING THEY TRY AND PULL IF YOU SIMPLY BUY AND HOLD. I REPEAT BUY AND HOLD. BUY AND HOLD. DONT DO ANYTHING ELSE. DONT BUY ANYTHING ELSE. BUY SHARES AND HOLD. THAT COUNTERS ALL FKERY THEY CAN TRY AND PULL. STOP FEEDING THEM WITH OPTION PREMIUMS**

If no one bought options in a perfect scenario, THEY WOULDNT HAVE MAX PAIN IDEAL PRICES TO DRIVE THE STOCK TOWARDS. THEY CANT SHORT IT INDEFININITELY CAUSE THEN APE SEE BARGAIN AND BUY. THEY WOULD BECOME HEADLESS CHICKENS NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO. ONLY WAY OUT THEN FOR THEM IS TO GO LONG ON THE STOCK ALSO TO COVER LOSSES AND FK OVER OTHER SHORTS. THEN IT WOULD BE SHORTS VS SHORTS SEEING who bails on the other first.

At the end of the day they still have that lump sum short position that they haven't cleared. They still have to buy this back from us eventually. Squeeze is not Squoze. But helping them with their margin sure isn't making this process any faster and you are doing more harm then good playing options unless you yourself are a whale with the power to influence price.

**Edit 1**: Forgot to include this part. Not saying this is actually happening.. but can you also imagine **if** there were friendly whales who are trying to help themselves and help us. If they knew that this week hedgies have chosen to go long.(they probably have more data than us and insider info) But we apes hear other apes saying we need to reach $200 this week! its already at 195! there are xxx number of calls that would be ITM if it hits $200! Now imagine if most of those calls were from the hedgies. Friendly whales try their best to keep the price below that to bleed them out for that Friday. Then manic apes throwing their last few dollars genuinely thinking it would help to get the price over $200. Friendly whales at their desks be like FML whut these apes doin?! Then price ends at $201 and apes celebrate while friendly whales banging their heads on their tables.In conclusion, we don't have all the info. We never know. We don't know all the little pieces of the puzzle. The best is we can do is hypothesize. Even if we find info online, how do we know how reliable the data is? It could be a trojan horse for all we know. So rather than be a nuisance, just buy and hold normally, we know for a fact that can only be good thing. but don't set price targets, especially based on option activity. and yes again. don't play options.

**Edit 2**: \*\*Many people are asking but if I scalp options and make more money to buy more GME then what's the harm?\*\*its the exact same logic as people who day trade GME. Again I will re-iterate. It is not my place to tell you what to do with your monies. This is not advice. But if you wouldn't day trade GME then you shouldn't do the same with options. If everyone do the same then when liftoff? But in terms of the technical aspect on how it benefits hedgies and negatively affects apes, there are too many variables involved to give you guys a definite answer because by playing options you give hedgies many options (no pun intended) to handle the situation. but the more options are bought, the more info and markers you give them to work with. the more ways they can fk you or apes together as a whole. I do not know their exact liquidity, I do not know their maintenance margin at the moment. But this would be my best hypothesis on how they are handling the situation if you buy:

**Deep ITM options** : they delta hedge this accordingly and just make money off the spread like any MM would

**ITM options** : depending on what is their plan for the week. They could handle it the same way they handle Deep ITM options or if they know they are driving the price down by expiry, they don't even delta hedge these as they know they will expire worthless.

**OTM options** : Again same logic as ITM options. totally depends on their play for the week

**Deep OTM options** : They probably dont give a fk about you. The fact that you have bought deep OTM options is likely that you aren't going to scalp these for tiny profits until the squeeze

Think about it this way. their short positions that they got buttfked with are **sunk cost**. what they are doing each and every week is just to ensure that for that specific week they end up positive.

The only way I can possibly think of to fk them is to prematurely exercise your ITM options. But as much as retarded apes like to say, lets be real. how many people actually even have the cash to exercise their options. I dont expect anyone to also. They know you are planning to sell your options. so when you sell your options some other schmuck buys them. As long as before that option expires they drive the price down to make them worthless, then why bother to delta hedge?

So how do we stop this from happening? don't buy options. lol. same answer.

and with the people who are talking about covered calls and different strategies and spreads. chillax I am not referring to you guys. doing all that is fine and dandy. My post is intended for people who are playing options nakedly or for people who genuinely think buying options for GME are safe and fair or are helping with the gamma squeeze just because so many simple apes have been hollering gamma squeeze gamma squeeze like its the first words they have learned. IMO the gamma squeeze is extremely unlikely given the fact that MM sees all. MM is the fkin eye of sauron. How can they possibly be caught in a gamma squeeze when they see all the positions...?

The amount of simple apes out there astounds me. when I first released this post, the first 2 comments were innocent simple apes telling me that I am the minority. others have done trusted DD to show that a gamma squeeze **""IS NEEDED""** for the SS... and i'm sitting here like.. wtf?

So I shall end this edit again with... Buy and Hold. that way you suffer nothing. because to be honest, this stock is not mooning if there isnt a reason to. I dont want to be negative nancy but I am saying at this point in time it might be a stalemate for a little while. But we still hold all the cards. We cant lose if we just hold. They still bleed daily (again unless youre feeding them options plays)

There has to be a catalyst. or an action from a big whale, like in the Shkreli squeeze. We don't know when that is. but so what? we hold shares. we can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent. when this moons we might all be millionaires. you cannot wait till then? Honestly. they cannot drive the price below a 100. or even close to 100. at those prices we would just gobble them back up.

**Edit 3**: I see some people asking about the deep OTM optionswhen I say they don't give give a fk about the deep OTM options, I mean those that ape buy, not those that currently exist, which they probably own. Again these are only my opinions but here goes.

1st possibility: Hedgie has certain amt of maintenance margin right? Pass a certain point they get margin called right? So how do they show their broker/regulators that they are sufficiently covered? they buy a lot of deep OTM options. Remember when they bought these they were relatively cheap. We don't know their exact short positions so there's no way to determine what is the critical price GME has to hit before shit hits the fan...but as price increases, they lose more and more money on their shorts, but their 800 calls start gaining more and more value. One goes down one goes up. This helps them maintain their maintenance margin without getting margin called that quickly in event of upward price movements as one helps mitigate the other albeit unevenly. Again we dont know the breaking point at which the losses from the shorts outweigh the gains from their calls enough so that they get margin called because we dont know the exact positions... but yea just my 2 cents worth. but we definitely know it has to be over 350 since they were ok with the price reaching that level before shutting it down.

2nd possibility:  Also owned by hedgies. Used as a red herring. A trojan horse of sorts. They knew apes would suss out the big 800 call volume. remember the march 19th hype? but think about it. simply because of spending a few million on this distraction, how many simple ape jump into buying calls for march 19 that expired worthless all the way up to 800 ? these were all premiums they gobbled up for free. FFS they might have been the ones themselves to leak the info that ""oh checkout all these weird large call options at 800! some big money must know something we don't!"" Then ape go me want banana too me buy many deep OTM options. then many ape die.

The point is they dont want / dont expect these calls to ever make money. they are there for show more than anything. ideally they still want the stock to crash and burn.  


**Edit 4:** To all the people screaming but in January gamma squeezed happened. How dare you invalidate the theory of the gamma squeeze! Explain January!! I did. You just didn't read. What happened in January happened within a few days. Many apes with banks full of money poured into GME with call options and shares in a short span of time. This was worldwide news. That kind of unexpected influx caught them with their pants down. Now compare that period of time vs now. Where is your sudden influx of volume going to come from? Is this the same situation? No one is claiming gamma squeezes don't exist. It just does not apply as much anymore in this current situation. Do you think because you just learned what gamma squeezes mean that its a common occurrence and an everyday thing? But feel free to have your own opinion.  
Also people say why not just use a broker that doesn't route through Citadel. Eh.. do you think most MM/brokers dont sell data or share it? payment for order flow isn't a new thing. It has just been brought to light because of what happened with Robin hood. Even facebook sells your data. you think any MM/broker don't engage in this? It's free money for them. is your broker a non-profit? I use IBKR and even they admit they do payment for order flow, just that its a much smaller % of their overall revenue, which means nothing at all. Just means they have other revenue incomes. But long story short, they all do it.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I know I said I would continue this post with the Shkreli squeeze but it would be weird if I did a post on the loan fee rate, loanable shares and its relation to the squeeze in this post itself so I will do it on another post possibly tomorrow. But have a read on it first if you haven't. I know others have talked about this before. But it seems like people keep talking more about the VolksW squeeze in comparison to GME. I find that the Shkreli squeeze has way more similarities. Also MM (such as citadel) could be hiding the actual data and releasing whatever info they want to the public - as we know, the fines are negligibly small [https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/](https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/)but TLDR maybe.. just maybe whale intentionally loaning out shares and waiting for right time to recall them. letting more shorters short themselves into oblivion so liftoff has that much more squeeze power.

But it's an incomplete picture because:

1. It only gives the data for the last trading day.  We need historical data to find trends.
2. It only gives the number of orders.  We need order sizes to compute volume.

My brother and I set out to find the missing data and compute how many shares of GME are in Fidelity's retail accounts.  Here's what we've figured out:

## Mining historical data

Starting 3/18 we scraped Fidelity every day:

https://imgur.com/a/Zi0Xoo4

Which we then painstakingly transcribed into a table:

[Since 3/18, every day there are more buy orders than sells](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRjpGn7c6iozFnAs_nQFQUYNxTbS-Etkha5GUCVa5Br0y2Kv-sZ_tBKtc_tPhDYbPbps92jC3tSXLqH/pubchart?oid=124323433&format=interactive).

## Estimated order sizes

Neither of us have direct access to level 2 historical order flow data, so we improvised by scraping [""Stocks Big Plays""](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdwwRjEyseTOUYxUWZn2Uqw)'s YouTube channel.
We were able to find archived streams for all of the days in our data set except March 23 and March 28.
We then transcribed the top bid and ask orders at 9:30, 10:30, 12:00, 13:30 and 15:55, giving 5 data points per day. 
[The distribution of order sizes looks roughly Pareto (not surprising)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRjpGn7c6iozFnAs_nQFQUYNxTbS-Etkha5GUCVa5Br0y2Kv-sZ_tBKtc_tPhDYbPbps92jC3tSXLqH/pubchart?oid=442492841&format=interactive):

https://imgur.com/a/pSZt6YW

This gives us something to work with, but there are some issues:

1.  *Noise*:  We can try to compensate for this with more samples and also biasing our estimates to be more conservative.
2.  *Algo trades*: We observed weirdly regular blocks of bid/asks would sometimes flood the books on both sides (eg. 33, 33, 33...).  Fortunately these seem to be wash sales and so their net effect on purchased shares should be close to 0.
3.  *Whales*: Some buy orders are waaaay too larget and not likely retail.  These are usually in blocks of of 500 or more shares.  We exclude outliers by discarding order sizes greater than 1 std deviation above the mean.

With these adjustments we get the following stats

|    | Average | Std. Dev. | Average (Excl. Outliers) |
|:--:|--------:|----------:|-------------------------:|
| **Bid** | 112.46 | 270.71 | 51 |
| **Ask** | 109.54 | 232.66 | 65.66 |

## Putting it together

We propose the following simple formula to estimate the shares purchased each day:

```
Net shares = (Avg. buy) * (# Buy orders) - (Avg. sell) * (# Sell orders)
```

Based on the above analysis, we can plausibly assume the average buy is 51 shares and the average sell is 66.
[Plugging in the numbers from Fidelity, we get the following cumulative share purchases:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRjpGn7c6iozFnAs_nQFQUYNxTbS-Etkha5GUCVa5Br0y2Kv-sZ_tBKtc_tPhDYbPbps92jC3tSXLqH/pubchart?oid=1738592533&format=interactive)

https://imgur.com/a/eX8ZleU

Or in other words, **FIDELITY CUSTOMERS PURCHASED 6.1 MILLION SHARES OF GME SINCE 3/18**

If we include whales as retail, the number goes up to 17 million.
Since Fidelity represents at most 15% of all retail buyers, *I extrapolate that more than 40 million shares were purchased last month alone*.

------

**EDIT** To account for these numbers maybe being too high, I used only 1 std for removing outliers instead of 2 std.  If we use a range of 2 stddev, we get an average buy price of 56 and sell price of 77 and a higher total purchased share count of 6.3 million.  

Also for those who still think these numbers are unrealistic, FT has reported that retail trading continues to grow and is now the 2nd largest volume of all trading, after HFT/algo trades.  We are bigger than the ETFs, mutual funds and hedge funds:

https://archive.is/drLS7

**EDIT 2**  To be clear these numbers are for customer *orders* not transfers.  This is 6.1 million new shares net purchased during the last month, not including any transfers.

**EDIT 3** The median buy order size in this data is 34 and sell order is 56.  If you use these for order sizes, you would get 2.6 million purchased.",2021-04-17 21:31:22

# Notes on the earnings call conference.

 This was a completely normal call. They go through the results as published.  This wasn't never going to be a call about dropping huge news bombs, Q&A's or even hearing from Cohen. Remember, RC isn't C suite (yet) and has no responsibilities to the shareholders. 

We will now start to get a steam of good news stories over the next weeks now we are not in a black out period. Just stay the course apes. 

# --------------------------------------------------

# 

The report is overall good. There are some missed targets, but given that it was during the hardest year for retail ever then it can only be seen as good that revenue was only down 3.2% y/y. This is a massive reversal on its downwards trend.

Gamestop is continuing to suspend guidance, this is due to covid-19.

We have a new COO former Google and Amazon exec Jenna Owens.

Sales in Feb up 23%!!!!! Q1 is going to be deadly!!!

# Current CEOs comments:

George Sherman, GameStop’s chief executive officer, said, “I am proud of how our entire organization came together in 2020 to adapt to the challenging pandemic environment, effectively serve our customers’ demand for gaming and entertainment products, and navigate through the year with strong liquidity and a strengthened balance sheet. Our execution led to a profitable fourth quarter that included a **6.5% comparable store sales growth,** a **175% increase in global E-Commerce sales** and a **$92.6 million reduction in SG&A**. The past year also saw us take steps to accelerate our de-densification efforts and streamline our store footprint, leverage our retail locations to provide same-day delivery and curbside pickups, and continue to enhance our suite of E-Commerce platforms. We also added important experience to our board by appointing several new directors with backgrounds in corporate finance, E-Commerce and technology and subsequently established a strategy-focused committee to accelerate our transformation.”

“**We are off to a strong start in 2021 as February comparable store sales increased 23%**, led by continued strength in global hardware sales. As we look ahead, we are excited by the opportunities that are in front of us as we begin prioritizing long-term digital and E-Commerce initiatives while continuing to execute on our core business during this emerging console cycle. Our emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue,”

There's a lot of reddit users/lurkers who never actually post or comment. I may not be speaking for all of us quiet redditors but I may be speaking for at least a small percentage of us. 

The past couple weekends WSB has been flooded with negativity, bots pressuring to sell positions, and harassing/berating GME holders specifically. There have even been sponsored ads for 'bars of silver' lol. 

Based upon the recent removal of original mods (even though it's been claimed that order has been restored) its unlikely that things will go back to normal on WSB for awhile. I'd take the current posts and overall sentiment you read over there with a grain of salt. This also applies to all stock related subreddits as bots have pretty much infiltrated anywhere GME posts exist. 

Go to Google trends and search 'buy reddit accounts' or something similar and you will see the exponential increase in January 2021. 

If nothing has truly changed about your convictions related to GME and there are no updated factual statistics presented then there is no plausible reason for you to abandon your bullish sentiment. If you do find something compelling please share it so we can all benefit. 

It was a luxury being reassured by fellow 🦍 with 🙌💎 and DFVs daily screenshots. Now comes real gut check time to see if the whole premise of retards holding strong together can send us to the moon and then on to Valhalla. 

I think Cuban made some good points during his AMA and as a billionaire he told us to HOLD if we could afford to. That being said he doesn't actually have a stake in this and it's much easier being said than done. If you are heavily swayed by emotions with price swings or bearish posts you read on here it could be a sign that maybe a little too much skin was put into the game.  

Why is there so much noise if shorts truly covered? Why are the calculations for short interest being modified daily and formulas used to calculate interest changed all together? Why had the media been running stories of shorts having 'covered' for the past week when this was never newsworthy in the past? Why are we seeing huge price drops / red swings on less volume with higher % buy orders in a day? Why are there circuit breakers / trading halts for volatile upswings but not downswings in share price? Why do investigations appear to be going after the retail investors/redditors as opposed to the HF guys? Why has WSB been taken over by BOTS and every GME post is taken down within hours by AutoMods?  

These are all questions that may be perceived as negatives/bear premise that I see as positives confirming my bias lol. I am not a financial advisor and this is for entertainment purposes only especially since I can't read and draw with Crayons. I am an unintelligent ape since I have been holding and buying all the dips lol. 

I'm waiting till the report on Tuesday 2/9 when factual information should be made available to the public. The HFs know a lot of sentiment relies on the results of this report so they may be more inclined to manipulate it. They may also be inclined to drive the price to new lows on Monday if the report will implicate HFs/media have been straight up lying to the general public. Regardless I won't be making any decisions until this data can be interpreted. 

'The stock market is a tool for the transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient.' 

'Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy only when others are fearful.' 

Regardless next week will be hectic to say the least. 

Do your own DD and don't let others sway you. We made it this far together for a reason, and they are pulling out all the stops for a reason.

Edit:

Holy smokes you guys blew this up🤯. This is legit like my first post so did not expect many people to read this. I feel bad for all the grammar mistakes and run-on sentences now lol. Thanks for all the awards (probably should just buy GME)!

This is just my opinion and I have no idea what will end up transpiring next week. The price could go up or down, all I know is that I like the stock! I intend to hold a long term position of GME because I grew up trading-in games since the N64🎮🕹. I like Ryan Cohen and the direction he intends to take the company and am excited to see his future moves which seem to be promising so far.

I just listed a few of the questions/issues I have about the events that have occurred during the past couple weeks. There are many more points to be made and these were just a few that happened to be at the top of my mind while writing the post. There are a lot of good DD posts scattered throughout this sub and alternate subs that have not been taken down. PM me if you wants ideas of other subs to check or websites to research. 

Just to clarify I intend to use the information presented on the 2/9 short interest report to help form my decision about whether to BUY more/how much or if I will be boring and just HOLD. Real talk I'll probably just end up buying more (these levels are too hard to resist) 😅lol. I was not trying to imply any major price movements on/around this date, I truly have no idea what will end up happening no one does. Link to info about the reporting date:

**Why is GME's price changing?**

Short hedge funds (SHF) sold shares that they didn't own because they thought GME would go bankrupt.

Think of it like an airline. There's only so many seats on the flight. The hedgies thought the flight was going to be cancelled so they printed some fake tickets and sold those too. Then the flight didn't get cancelled. Now, because there are only so many seats available, they need to stand at the gate and buy back the extra tickets, then rip them up so no-one tries to use them. It doesn't matter if that ticket was a real one or the fake one. They need to buy it and destroy it until only the original number remains.

The problem is, everyone is really excited for the trip, so no-one wants to sell. So the price of the tickets is too high for the hedgies. Short term, they are printing even more tickets to give them cash to deal with the people at the front of the queue, but all that does is make the line longer. And there is still only the original number of seats on the plane.

**How can they sell shares that they don't own?**

If SHF think a stock will go down in price, they are allowed to locate and borrow shares from other people, sell them and try to buy them back later. To keep the metaphor going, they can give you a few bucks to hold your ticket and promise to sell it to me at today's price. Then if the price goes down they can buy it from you at the cheaper price to deliver to me.

What we think has happened is, they didn't just borrow your ticket, they photocopied it and lent it to someone else at the same time as they sold it to me. As in, they lent out the shares they had borrowed. Because they have a few days to sort that out before anyone notices, they usually get away with it. Normally people buy and sell all the time so it gets lost in the noise.

**Isn't relending shares you've borrowed illegal?**

Yes. You aren't allowed to sell shares that don't exist. If you see the term ""naked short selling"" this is what they mean. There may be some misreporting going on to cover up the fact but punishments are relatively lean historically such as a proportionally small fine. There's been a lot of regulation changes in a short period of time which may be gearing up to deal with that.

**What's with the massive price spikes every so often?**

This is probably cyclical. If you see T+21 or T+35 mentioned this is referring to the time after a trade that they have to find that share they promised to give you. Market Makers get a little longer than your standard HF. Because shares are so hard to find, it could be that SHF have to keep kicking the can down the road. In our airline metaphor, this is them printing extra tickets. T+21 and T+35 would be the day that people are arriving to collect their tickets so the SHF needs to order more from the printers. The last week of May was when these two dates overlapped so lots of pressure to find shares to deliver.

**If the price keeps going up, who will pay?**

First the SHF has to buy back what they can from the market. If they run out of cash, the clearing house auction off all their stuff and buy back with that. If that's not enough, the clearing house is on the hook because they rubber stamped the trades. They can use the cash they have but, if they run out, they can ask for cash from their members.

If that isn't enough, the DTCC is on the hook for failing to keep the records straight. If they run out of cash, it's down to the government for not intervening in the fraud soon enough. When it gets to this point, trillions will have been spent buying back shares.

**How long can they keep this going?**

No-one knows for sure. It seems that SHF are running low on money already. There have been massive sell offs across all their other holdings. This is why, when the market tanks, it's usually at the same time GME is doing well.

There have been lots of rule changes too. The clearing houses are asking for more collateral (the money or assets that needs to be put up as assurance in order to keep or establish these short positions). They can also ask for reports more often and can force members to close their positions sooner.

**How do we know the SHF haven't bought back enough shares?**

There may be some misreporting going on. SHF's may be mislabeling short positions as long, not reporting them at all, or putting out press releases of how they have covered their positions. The fines for doing so are relatively minor, and if it means the difference between going bankrupt or getting another day to dig themselves out of a hole, there's a lot of incentive to cheat.

There's been a large increase in whistleblower awards handed out by the SEC this year for information that leads to a penalty.

The push to vote will shine a light on this. There is a shareholder meeting on June 9th and many have already voted. The vote count will give an insight into how many fake shares have been sold. Even this number will be lower than the true number. Remember that not all holders can/will vote.

There are also other indicators that shares are hard to get hold of. Volumes traded each day have been declining meaning fewer shares are flying back and forth between traders. Shares have been harder to borrow than they were before.

**What's the company like?**

GME have had some great news lately. The incoming chairman is an e-commerce legend (Ryan Cohen) who is putting together a team to take the company into the future. He's already built a successful e-com company (Chewy) and is very customer focused with an eye for quality.

The latest news is that they are developing an NFT to be built using Ethereum. This will allow for digital games to be traded in and resold. An NFT is an encrypted record of who owns a specific digital asset.  When you buy a game download, a corresponding digital coin would be minted that says it belongs to you. If you want to sell it on, you could transfer ownership of that coin just like you do with bitcoin or Ethereum now.

They also have no debt and $500+ million dollars in the bank.

Apes had a good day today, I know I did! GME finished the day up 52.69%, or a whopping 63.41 points! This is great for us, though in the grand scheme of things, a $60 move is pussy shit,

This aint no mothafuckin financial advice, hoe.

Obligatory.

Aaaaaaaanyway, I was super hyped watching the price action play out today. GME showed really good strength throughout the day, and I was able to predict where GME would reject levels and find support. I'm gonna share with you in this post what I was watching today, what I expect tomorrow, and just give a general overview on the technicals that I've been seeing.

Something to note however, while trend lines and support/resistance levels are good to watch and are valid, the actual indicators themselves don't carry as much significance as people would like to think, simply because there are so many outside factors that affect GME's price.

For starters, this is a view of the GME 4hr chart today.

https://preview.redd.it/ruk6wu9d29p61.png?width=2874&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae44cc2e107d2a6db0a0fb0b62c3677df332cb1c

What about this chart looks bullish? Yesterday, all indicators were pointing towards a very green day for GME today. Sure enough, that's what we got. The MACD (bottom indicator) has crossed (blue line over yellow is bullish), and yesterday in my DD I noted that it was curling upwards, which is a bullish indication.

The TTM squeeze is turning bullish as well, as seen by the red bars turning yellow (yellow bars mean bearish momentum is fading and bullish momentum is coming in. Red is bearish.)

On top of that, RSI (middle indicator) was very oversold going into close yesterday, so it was natural to conclude that we would see an uptick in RSI, correlated with price.

Sure enough, RSI picked up, and so did the price.

Here's the 1hr.

https://preview.redd.it/dxg0s07x29p61.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=383f525dc3b7676b6195677bcd4e37afe855ec59

If you read my posts regularly, you know how much I emphasize gap ups and gap downs. The bottom green box represents the gap up from march 8th, wherein the gap exists around 140. This gap was filled yesterday, thus completing all visual retracements. Once this gap was filled yesterday, I had a very good feeling that we would see green today, though maybe not this much. Pleasant surprise!

I won't explain every support/resistance level, though all the lines you see above are significant levels where price bounces off of.

For example, look at this 5m view of GME.

https://preview.redd.it/gu8w35aa39p61.png?width=2764&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f33ed31e567e0363adf2a44a587fe80305ff7f2

Notice how price yesterday bottomed out on the blue slanted line? Then today, once we broke above the blue line underneath the pink box (gap down on daily chart, will attach graph in next picture), the blue line than acted as support.

https://preview.redd.it/uu41fezj39p61.png?width=2854&format=png&auto=webp&s=a2c2cda07310a669b7df1c5077a71516e5e9673b

The pink box represents the gap down on the daily chart from yesterday. Sure enough, that level proved to be a significant level to watch, where price hovered at for the majority of the day before breaking out.

Here's a view of the daily chart so you can visualize the gap down.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/u1funmtq39p61.png?width=2682&format=png&auto=webp&s=26a74c99ffabb9a64f34f724b677b02768388e8b

Sure enough, the top of the gap acted as resistance, as well as the 175 level (previous support, level we dropped to on the flash crash on 3/10)

https://preview.redd.it/zk1itw7249p61.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a296382cb91bee9eddc89ffccea58bed1a0d783

Chart is self explanatory, though you can visualize how the red line (175) acted as a resistance level, same for 178 (the top of the pink box). Also notice how once the gap was finally filled and price moved above the gap, the top of the gap then acted as support. We know this is true as none of the candles closed in the box after price broke out, though it got very close. This validates the support level, so keep an eye on the 178 area.

If anyone noticed, we actually got an intraday cup and handle today. I know a lot of people are hyping up the cup and handle pattern on the daily chart (myself included), but here's proof of how the pattern works.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q00hbhbn49p61.png?width=2674&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d928932728ae577da5bf88bd281ddfcf8459b88

Might be hard to visualize if you don't know what to look for, but remember the stages of the cup and handle pattern. High price, low price, high price again, than low price but not as low as the lowest price, then breakout. This is what we observed today intraday!

&#x200B;

Remember that volume is the biggest driver in a stock price, today we had just over 50 million volume, whereas the past week, the highest volume we saw was 23 million volume on 3/16.

Bars on the bottom represent volume, you can see clear as day today was a big volume day (relatively speaking).

&#x200B;

Tomorrow I will be watching the **194.25** level, as this is a significant level (50% Retracement), **212, and 230**. I didn't expect us to fill the gap down from yesterday so fast, but no complaints on my end.

As for support levels to watch tomorrow, watch the **175-178** level (top of gap down), **167** (bottom of gap down), and **157.85** You can visualize these levels below.

Tomorrow I expect a bullish continuation, but we all know that buying and holding is the way. If we retrace at all, above you have the levels to watch to get the best deal!

&#x200B;

TLDR: Read everything ya filthy ape. I put hard work into these DDs to educate the masses. That being said, buy and hodl. **this is the way.**

edit: thanks for the platinum! Never got an award that nice before <3

edit 2: whoa... didn't even realize this till now.  I just looked at it as a bullish engulfing candle (when the closing green candle is bigger than the entire closing red candle, signals a reveral). Well it's actualy called a marubozu and its a really rare reversal confirmation. 

often times it signals the 1/3 retracement to validate the cup and handle pattern. You know what the 1/3 retracement of 345 is? 115. Today's low was 116.9, and yesterday's was 118.62 (112.83 in after hours). What's important here is that today's trading session low was lower than yesterday's, which confirms the marubozu candle.

What's interesting is this has occurred years ago but why now and what could this cause. There's a high chance that FB crashes on market open ""due to these headlines"" but what if someone wants to liquidating their FB position without arising suspicion. We all know who loves media headlines, the shorties so I decided to look further

Coincidence I think not.

Edit: To clarify on my speculation why the shorts would make this ""news"" pop up on their holdings. Is that the market would have already have adjusted this information to be reflects in FBs price but a new dip on monday would be from these liquidating positions.

494,Best or worst decision,1617943013.0,"Quite a few people have given me shit about putting approx 40k on amc. I essentially liquidated my portfolio to bet on amc. 

The way I look at it.... I graduated from uc Berkeley in 2008 with around 34k from college debt with degrees in political science and philosophy. Couldn’t find a job that would really allow me to live, pay rent, car payment , and student loan payment. Lived paycheck to paycheck and racked up 60k in credit card debt trying to scrape by in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

I went to grad school and racked up another 200k in debt thinking I would make more money and have a better standard of living. I make more money now but still living pay check to pay check as my loan payments have obviously increased as well. 

I figure, what’s more risky... going in to debt to get a college degree so that you can spend your life working to pay that fucking bullshit debt back, or try to make some money the way the 1% has for years on end?  Is it more risky to get a college degree now or put money on amc with you apes and hope to take down this bullshit system?? I vote for the moon. 

I’m happy to stand with you guys on days like the last few. And I keep reading and learning along with you. Even if we don’t go where we’re hoping , I’ve still learned a ton and believed in something that could potentially destroy this crooked bullshit we call the market.

&#x200B;

I'm a filmmaker with a question.

Did the hearing today piss you off? Did the Hulu ""documentary"" piss you off? Does the condescension toward retail investors piss you off? WHY WASN'T COHEN MENTIONED IN THE HULU ""doc""?

No one is focusing on the real issues or telling the real story and it's driving me insane.

We can change that.

Filmmaking is an arduous and expensive process so I want to gauge interest with all of you apes before I do the deep dive and make this shit happen:

So my questions are:

1. **Do you want to see a REAL documentary about the short squeeze of a lifetime and the battle against big money?** (upvote for a yes! Downvote for a no!)
2. **What** **key points should the film make?** (Drop it in the comments)

Cinema is the art form of the people for the people. The moving image has an unmatched power to captivate, move, and inspire. This community is rich in knowledge and resources and we shouldn't just stand by while the rich and powerful get to lie to the world about what's happening.

Fuck 'em.

I may post this a few more times at different hours of the day to make sure I'm not hitting a dead spot in the day! Not spam!

EDIT: COHEN

EDIT/UPDATE:

Damn y’all support is there. You all have some great ideas and have given me a ton to think about. There’s something really powerful about this thing coming from the community itself.

I’m gonna work on next steps and update y’all as soon as I’ve got ‘em!

Time for me to get my Guinness on. Happy St. Paddy’s!

\**^(To be clear, this is not an attempt to sway public opinion about the stock in any way or to manipulate/pump etc. This is a simple question by a filmmaker to gauge interest in the topic before losing sleep for months to make a film no one wants.)*

I was going to wait until Friday to post an update on further glitches this week as I believe there has to be something to them but this to me is too huge not to share and to hopefully bring more attention.   

EDIT: I changed this flair to discussion rather than DD and as I mentioned below in this post this is a THEORY based on linear maths to show $25m+ is POSSIBLE not destiny! I believe it's important to understand the squeeze in theory is infinite if these numbers being shown in the ""glitches"" do mean something. They could mean nothing but if you can't grasp the implications of billions or trillions of possible traded volume on a company that only has 70m shares in existence with roughly only 48m shares actually being able to be traded publicly then you'll never see 100k, 500k, 1m+. Please read my post in full and I also suggest reading the other links I've posted as well before commenting you crazy fucks. 


Before we go any further I will say this, this is research but it is also speculation this is in no way definitive but it is my personal belief that everybody is seriously underestimating the banana tsunami that is coming. Think about all the other times wallstreet has crashed. It was vs bankers, other hedgies. The transfer of wealth has always been a battle of the elites being greedy just swinging their dicks around. They are used to battling each other, they have never engaged with lowly apes. They should've dealt with the first few apes when they had the chance but they didn't. They were too arrogrant and now diddy kong is looking like king fuck your wife kong and he likes the stock.   


Here is the link to the previous DD that I had worked out using the strange glitches we saw last week that totalled 1.2B, which lead me to believe the true value of the stock last friday was $7,227.83

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me2dm1/true\_value\_of\_a\_gme\_share\_is\_722783/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/me2dm1/true_value_of_a_gme_share_is_722783/)  


This is another incredible bit of DD from another wrinkle brained ape who seems to think very similar to me,  multiple apes working individually but coming out with very similar results to me with slightly different methods, sounds like good news to me. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mewkf8/thesis\_si\_is\_upwards\_of\_2000\_gme\_is\_a\_100/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mewkf8/thesis_si_is_upwards_of_2000_gme_is_a_100/)  


In an effort to be transparent and to allow Apes to think for themselves here is a counter bit of equally fantastic DD that suggests these glitches are something else, I like both theories and both suggest GME go BBRRRR.   


[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mf1f6n/i\_was\_missing\_a\_key\_piece\_of\_the\_puzzel\_this\_is/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mf1f6n/i_was_missing_a_key_piece_of_the_puzzel_this_is/)  


NOW I want to thank and credit u/TDETLES and u/DrPewNStuff for bring this to my attention and allowing me to expand on my previous theory. 

  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgl19d/calling\_smart\_ape\_yahoo\_high\_volume\_graph/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgl19d/calling_smart_ape_yahoo_high_volume_graph/)

4.29 Trillion... yes TRILLION! You can say this is a glitch it means nothing, if that's what you choose to believe I personally don't see how we can be seeing glitches at this level. How can a stock with less than 70m shares in total be showing glitches into the billions and now trillions worth of volume.   


Just like last time I recommend people watch this.   


[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25EUhZGBws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25EUhZGBws)  

Ok so using my previous DD as the base for this and what impact 1.2B would have on the price  


94m in volume from the trigger price of $46.12 lead to a price increase to $184.68 - 300.434%   


 1,201,846,831 / 94,189,110 = 12.75993404   


That suggests that we could expect a price increase 12.75x bigger than the 94m volume.   


4,290,000,000,000 / 94,189,110 = 45,546.67   


This suggests a price increase 45,546.67x bigger than the 94m volume. 

&#x200B;

[I'm not fine. I'm never going to sleep again.](https://preview.redd.it/519d5c7le8q61.jpg?width=183&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc973fe7bcd24dd88046a04b3d5b141f01c71239)

This is what I thought we were dealing with...   


300.434 x 12.75993404 = 3833.518

A 3833.518% increase on $183.75

$7,227.83  


Now the update....  


300.434 x  45,546.67 = 13,683,767.26

A 13683767.26% increase on $183.75...  


$25,143,922.35   


Now this is a theory based on the 4.29T volume and the price action being linear to the last jump we saw of over 300%. Nothing in the stock market ever works this linear I am not saying I'm 100% right on this and I encourage discussion. What I'm saying is that we have all potentially vastly understimated just how big this is through ETFs, FTDs and other hedgefund fuckery the true volume of shorts is into the trillions.   


When I post this price of $25,143,922.35 that is based purely on the math. If everybody diamond hands this COULD go MUCH HIGHER!!! There is no limit to the price of the stock. I don't want to hear anyone talking about ""oh but the market cap"" ""ha so you think GME is worth more than the planet"" Shut the fuck up. This isn't a value play this is hedgies potentially shorting this thing all the way to the moon and catapulting apes into another fucking dimension. I'm going to open a bottle of top shelf whiskey... I will see all you diamond apes on the moon.   


Apes set high scores.

I propose that we start using the term, “counterfeit share” instead of “naked” as a way to make the general public understand what’s happening here. In my conversations with people who don’t understand the situation the term counterfeit share elicits a much different response than naked short.

Edit: Wow, this blew up! I take the positive response to this as acceptance of the proposal! Let’s take it upon ourselves to create this change. We can do this by asking DD and other popular posts using the term “naked shorts” to edit or update to “counterfeit shorts”. Also, I think it would be a game changer if we could get legislators using this terminology. People like Alexis Goldstein using the word, counterfeit over and over in a hearing might be what it takes to get Congressmen and women to close their solitaire games and listen in. We need to remember the majority of legislators have no idea what’s happening with GME and we need them to understand if we are going to enact lasting change.

**4:07 Update**

Wow. That was slow. Literally nothing happened!!!

We'll try again tomorrow.

Current price: 180.32

**3:43 Update**

GME is still stalled. 

If volume doesn't break 10,000,000, I don't know the last time volume was so low.

This is not just a slow day, but one of the slowest in a while.

Volume: 8,600,000

Current price: 180.32

**3:30 Update**

GME maybe making a move? Please?

Current price: 181.14

**3:19 Update**

Sorry. Work picked up.

We've really not missed anything. It still pretty steady. I was hoping power hour would bring some excitement.

Current price: 178.47

**2:38 Update**

Please forgive me. I'm dealing with some things. I need to take a small break from updating.

Nothing to report from GME still.

Current price: 179.36

**1:54 Update**

Volume has slowed so much, we may not break 10,000,000. This is eerily calm. I feel like things are going to get insane at somepoint this week.

Current price: 181.21

**1:44 Update**

I keep refreshing my ticker because I feel like every time I look at it, it hasn't really changed.

I demand volatility! 

Seriously, I really wouldn't be surprised if this stays like this until the end of the day.

Volume: 7,400,000

Current price: 182.15

**1:19 Update** 

I tried going to the bathroom since exciting things usually happen when I go to the bathroom. 

There was some sort of fish that jumped in earlier, but the price is going back to its stability point around 181.

Volume is at 7,200,000, we may not break 15,000,000.

This turned into a crazy slow day. It makes sense seeing how there's no news to play off of.

The HFs want everyone to sell, but everyone is holding. The longer people hold, the more the HFs are getting backed into a corner. HFs are going to have to make some sort of move. This can't be sustainable for them.

Current price: 180.01

**1:08 Update**

No real update from GME. 

Banjo Mooseheart loves Sundays. Sundays are days where his parents are home and he usually gets to go on a long walk outside. [This is him waiting for the Browns game to start.](http://imgur.com/gallery/8yTex1y) He does have a window addiction.

Current price: 181.72

**12:53 Update**

GME is in the Green! It's probably just general volatility, but still pretty significant to be slowly recovering. Nobody seems to be making any real moves. They are taking out synthetic shares from ETFs, but I haven't seen anything from them lately.

We seem to be at a stalemate.

Current price: 183.43

**12:45 Update**

Y'all, is it normal to get a decent amount of hate mail at r/GME? I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would go to this subreddit to shit on people for talking about GME. I have people asking me to stop updating, or sharing a level of disappointment as thought they paid for my services. Only once did I receive anything like that at WSB and that was when GME tanked hard.

Be careful out there y'all, there seems to be a lot of bad faith actors running around trying to instill fear and negativity.

Current price: 180.00

**12:29 Update**

GME is doing nothing it seems. For some lunchtime entertainment, I offer my dog Banjo Mooseheart.

[Banjo Mooseheart lives a hard life.](http://imgur.com/gallery/pZc4FEn) Sometimes he has to get up in the morning. Those days are always difficult.

Y'all, I'm cutting people that deserve to be ahead of me. u/WardenElite is much smarter than I am and he can do cool things with candles and cups.

Please upvote [his thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/gme/comments/mfpae5) so he can be back where we deserves to be.

Current price: 179.23

**12:06 Update**

Yeah, if GME isn't going to do anything at lunch, we'll probably be here for a while. We'll need some sort of catalyst to make that interesting. I guess it's time to find pictures of Banjo Mooseheart.

Current price: 180.00

**12:01 Update**

What if an E-Sports organization sponsored me to quit my job and create content for GME and all other future meme stocks?

Nobody is really doing this in the style I do, and it seems that I've got a decent following.

I would stay with text reporting. I could do a podcast on what's been going on. I could build really cool graphs to show the data in easy to understand formats.

I'm just brainstorming ways where I can do this for you all for a living.

GME has stalled again.

Current price: 180.19

**11:50 Update**

I really don't know what their plan is going into lunch. They keep doing quick strikes and waiting until GME stabalized before striking again. GME is about to go into lunch in the green, which wouldn't really make people panic and sell.

I don't know. I don't have the brain of a HF. It just seems pointless to me.

Current price: 181.36

**11:35 Update**

Holy fuck y'all. We're number two behind rensole. I am beyond honored to be among some legendary Apes. I don't know how I made it here honestly, I'm just a smooth brained ape.

The HF attacks don't make much sense to me. Yes, they are forcing downward momentum, but the rate that they're going is so slow. I can't imagine that they're happy with this progress. These loses would be made up quickly with any sort of positive catalyst or just a bump in volume.

Don't be surprised if they try to force a crash right before lunch.

Current price: 177.58

**11:25 Update**

Volume trajectory is now under 20,000,000. This price is not representative of it's actual value and this drop is fabricated. Everyone seems to be waiting for the HFs to do what they can before jumping back in.

Volume: 5,700,000

Shorts available: 100,000

Current price: 177.52

**11:22 Update**

Some are asking about shorts. There are currently 100,000 shorts available as of 11:15. This is up from 20,000 at the end of last week.

There are shorting from so many places now that this number is starting to matter less.

I'll keep track of it though.

Current price: 177.17

**11:16 Update**

Ah yes, the old, ""let's tank the price right before lunch so everyone panics"" strategy. I'm sure that'll be more successful than the 10+ previous times you've done that.

You're not scaring anyone with these low drops.

Please cover your shorts.

Current price: 178.81

**11:04 Update**

GME. Sat. Back. Down.

I feel like at this point, we're watching a Snorlax lazily making it's way to the moon. However, this mf keeps taking it's time and stallin.

We might be here all day folks.

Current price: 181.09

**10:47 Update**

GME. Wont. Back. Down.

The only time GME when seriously went down was on Friday, where they had to move mountains to make that happen. After every attack, regardless of how low it falls, GME continues to stand and take that next step forward.

It's truly incredible to watch.

Current price: 182.27

**10:40 Update**

Does anyone else feel like these strikes are becoming less subtle? I feel like they've switched from a chisel to an sledgehammer.

And GME seems to want to get back up after every swing. It's back in the green.

Current price: 182.08

I have had MANY of you reach out asking for an update around the OBV after the craziness of the past few days so of of course I had to oblige. [If you have read my previous post,](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mb18u2/definitive_proof_that_gmes_price_has_been/) you can skip to the second half of this one :)

For anyone with any lingering doubts about GME price being getting manipulated prepare to have your 🦍🧠🤯.

I am going to show some fairly definitive proof, using a measure called **'On-Balance Volume'** which will show that all the downward price pressure has been with EXTREMELY minimal volumes.

You apes don't only have 💎✋ BUT ARE ALSO BUYING THE DIPS because total net buying volume has net INCRASED since January!

&#x200B;

**----------** **BOILERPLATE:**

I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀

**TLDR: Even after 5 days in the red, culminating in their huge attack on Wednesday, the overall buying pressure is still 14% higher than in January!  Proof that 🦍 are💎✋ AND are buying the dips! Overall positive buying pressure has only increased since January. 💎✋🚀🚀🚀**

&#x200B;

**---------- On Balance Volume (OBV)**

Before I 🤯 your mind, here is what **OBV (On-Balance Volume)** is all about:

>On Balance Volume (OBV) measures buying and selling pressure as a cumulative indicator, adding volume on up days and subtracting it on down days.

&#x200B;

On Balance Volume (OBV) line is simply a running total of positive and negative volume. A period's volume is positive when the close is above the prior close and is negative when the close is below the prior close.

>The absolute number of the OBV does not matter, what does is the relative height of the line over time.

&#x200B;

**Rising OBV reflects positive volume pressure that can lead to higher prices.** **Conversely, falling OBV reflects negative volume pressure that can foreshadow lower prices.**

&#x200B;

This means, that if we see a significant decline in share price, we should also see a decrease in OBV line at a similar magnitude.

For my fellow 🤓, here is the equation:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1uwki3q7pfp61.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e0aadb815d5229a76c55aa79c632514199597d8

Some people have asked about the limitations of OBV and [this is what is listed on investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onbalancevolume.asp):

>One limitation of OBV is that it is a **leading indicator**, meaning that it may produce predictions, but there is little it can say about what has actually happened in terms of the signals it produces. Because of this, it is prone to produce false signals. **It can therefore be balanced by lagging indicators.** Add a moving average line to the OBV to look for OBV line breakouts; you can confirm a breakout in the price if the OBV indicator makes a concurrent breakout.  
>  
>Another note of caution in using the OBV is that a **large spike in volume** on a single day can throw off the indicator for quite a while. For instance, a surprise earnings announcement, being added or removed from an index, or massive institutional block trades can cause the indicator to spike or plummet, but the spike in volume may not be indicative of a trend.

&#x200B;

**---------- Examples of share price following OBV**

Below I have 5 examples from other companies (AMD, Tesla, Cineplex, Royal Caribbean, Canopy) and all of them have OBV lines that very nicely go along with the share price.

Note: All data from TradingView (awesome app btw) and Period set to 1 day.

**This is what the relationship between OBV and price should look like.** In fact, the whole purpose of the OBV is that it actually can show when a price is about to move in a certain direction as you can see the spikes in OBV are all 1 to 2 periods before the share spikes.

* Here you can see huge positive buy pressure from Jan 12 to 27, increasing by 462% with a share price increase of $305 ([VWAP - volume weighted average price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp#:~:text=The%20volume%20weighted%20average%20price%20(VWAP)%20is%20a%20trading%20benchmark,and%20value%20of%20a%20security)).
* Then the share price dropped by $264 (80%) from January 29 to Feb 4. If this was a real drop (i.e. people were actually selling their shares), we would expect a relative decrease in the buying pressure, however we only see it go down by 9%! 🤣🤣
* When GME spiked in February, it actually gained more total positive buying pressure and surpassed the previous high point set on January 27!
* **On March 10 & 12, we were at the highest level, 25% higher than January.**
* **NEW:** After this peak, we saw a slow decline in OBV which is in line with the price drop **HOWEVER** even after the big attack on **March 24**, the OBV was once again **HIGHER than it should be** for that price drop. It should have gone down **at least another 10%** to where it was when hit $120 at the end of Feb.

&#x200B;

**THIS AS CLOSE AS YOU WILL GET TO PROOF OF 💎✋! Almost no one actually sold during BOTH these periods (January and This week), or we would have seen a huge increase in negative buy pressure.** If you just looked at the OBV, you would think that the stock price should be around $450-500

&#x200B;

The **red line is what I think the OBV SHOULD look like for the current stock price.**

&#x200B;

**Note: This observations is true if you set the period to 1 week, 1 day, 4 hours, 3 hours, 2 hours and 1 hour**

OTC trades for $GME

525,247,648/5,777,645 = 90.91 shares per trade

FINRA data pull of all tier 2 $GME shares since 02/08/2021

OTC + tier 2 trades 

1,060,898,317/15,289,319 = 69.38 shares per trade

Of course, this is FINRA data and the heggies pretty much can report anything they want. Especially with OTC data. So, the math probably looks more like this

I know you’re also thinking, how can there be 1 billion in volume since February? We better verify this with a yahoo finance day by day data pull. 

And the volume since February 8th adds up to 1,379,940,300

Wait so the market reported volume has a 319,041,983 share discrepancy than what is reported on FINRA? (BTW the volume has been 2,642,030,700 since the start of 2021 but I can’t get a FINRA data pull for January)

Hey Heggies, is there 319 million synthetic $GME shares right now?

Since these are most likely shorts underreported in OTC market trading;

$GME is likely shorted at least 457% of total shares and 706% of the float. I wouldn’t be surprised if the January numbers raise this estimate to the top end that another ape pointed out around 900%

More shorting evidence. As Citadel’s ownership in $GME share drops the price rips. They are shorting it to hold it down. Also note that their volume drops during that weeklong SSR saga. Meaning they don’t care to have $GME shares if they can’t short them.

Tier 1 shares since January 20,944,966/130,060 = 161 shares per trade. 

Alt 843,986/6,569 = 128 shares per trade 

OTC + Alt + tier 1 shares 39,992,907/187,684 = 213 shares per trade.

Alright now for the yahoo data pull, and… WTF?

The volume has been 267,687,800 since January. A discrepancy of 227,694,893! Too be fair $GME at only 20% of $XRT’s portfolio the heggies must short $XRT 5 times as hard.

So, the biggest spike in volume is right at the January peak for $GME. Basically, the short shell game started right away. No surprise seeing some volume spikes around $GME SSR times.

Update below, $XRT now only holds 6.75% of its portfolio in $GME. This shell game is coming to a close.

First thing to point out, do you see how the volume jumps prior to the January price peak? If the shorts covered and that really was a short squeeze the volume would be up with the price not before it. The shorts absolutely have not covered. This was either a gamma squeeze or good old-fashioned share buying. 

Then some boomer writes in Forbes that hyper rational traders are buying calls to trigger gamma squeezes and all the apes forget the example used was buying calls for 2% of the share price. The $GME calls are up to 40% the share price. Also, now that it is established how dangerous the dark pool is, maybe not buy calls and just buy shares? They don’t have to delta hedge for calls you can’t or won’t exercise. If you don’t buy the 100 shares at the strike, neither do they. The are NOT obligated to. Heggies are market makers. This means they’re playing on godmode. They can just send you the delta. You have no way to hold them accountable to purchase those 100 shares if you don’t exercise the call.

This is how Citadel sees you if you set a stop loss, use margins, or YOLO on calls.

TL:DR

When Citadel has the volume, $GME dips. When apes have the volume, $GME rips.

Speculation on the price of our Class A Common Stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate **short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our Class A Common Stock available for purchase on the open market**, investors with short exposure **may have to pay a premium to repurchase shares** of our Class A Common Stock for delivery to lenders of our Class A Common Stock.

Those repurchases may in turn, **dramatically increase the price of shares** of our Class A Common Stock until additional shares of our Class A Common Stock are available for trading or borrowing. This is often referred to as **a “short squeeze.”**

**A large proportion** of our Class A Common Stock **has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers which may increase the likelihood** that our Class A Common Stock **will be the target of a short squeeze.**

A short squeeze has led and **could continue to lead to volatile price movements** in shares of our Class A Common Stock that are unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance or prospects and, **once investors purchase the shares of our Class A Common Stock necessary to cover their short positions**, the price of our Class A Common Stock **may rapidly decline**.

I want as much input as we can get. This is not DD, this is speculation, and I want you to try to tear it apart from every angle.** /u/atobitt, /u/noderpsy, and /u/weeknddev **did fantastic research and speculation of their own, but with your blessing, I'd like to posit another Minimum Pain scenario, this time from the global perspective.**

You may have seen me talk about Pain Minimization in the past, meaning a scenario that not only allows the most people to profit, but also the fewest amount to get hurt. Each of these wonderful posts by the users above were individually confusing to me. Only when looking at all of them in conjunction did I start to see a bigger picture forming.

First, let's recap the players involved in the GME trade. There's the government, the SEC, the long hedges/whales, the shorties, and global retail investors. However, given /u/atobitt's revelations, we also need to consider ""US"" (America) and our role both on and by the rest of the world stage. If /u/atobitt's scenario proves true, I contest that the addition of this extra factor makes the GME squeeze  play far more confusing to analyze independently of the treasury short debacle. In fact, the only way I can see all these facts making sense is if they are intertwined, and part of a greater overall strategy.

The GME squeeze and the treasury issue beget one another, regardless of the order they take place in. However, if the GME squeeze takes place first, and also abides by the theories posited in /u/noderpsy and /u/weeknddev's posts, it can be used to conceal and alleviate the treasury shorting issue, allowing the market to remain as close as possible to business as usual, and maintain status quo on the world stage as far as the role of the US Dollar. Allow me to explain how:

**The Ideal Scenario**

To paraphrase /u/atobitt,  ""*The ENTIRE global financial economy is modeled after a fractional reserve system that is beginning to experience THE MOTHER OF ALL MARGIN CALLS.""* This is all you really need to know. If players are acting indepedently, and only in their own self-interest, regardless of whether or not a GME squeeze even happens, the outlook for America's future on the world stage is bleak at best.

As you may have learned over the past few months, the psychology of retail, both at home and abroad, is everything. In fact, it's really the only thing. As evidenced perfectly by a short squeeze, if a large percentage of the public decides a company is going to succeed, they will. If their shares are worth a certain number, they will be. And I can think of no situation worse for public perception about America, its government, its elite class, and its market, than for its own financial elite to be found to be shorting America itself. You've heard it countless times before from me, but after today's revelations, my *Fuckery Floor* just tripled. If the full depth of fraud were to be exposed to the rest of the world, the degree to which we are fucked as a sovereign nation cannot be adequately quantified with mere words.

So how do you avoid this? Is there any way to sweep it under the rug and largely maintain the status quo for the powers that be? Indeed there is, and /u/weeknddev laid it out earlier today. There have been a number of posts over the weeks about whether or not Blackrock wants to take down Citadel, or has a beneficial relationship with them, etc. Now don't get me wrong, if there was a way for Blackrock to side with Citadel over us without the entire house of cards crumbling around them, they would. But I don't think that they can, and that's why I think there's something to this honeypot theory.

Blackrock needs the status quo to be maintained. As I've said before, Blackrock absolutely shorts, but I don't think they naked short. And they certainly don't short treasuries. They understand the importance of the system as a whole continuing to exist and function in order for them to continue to manipulate it. In this case, the path of least resistance is to brutally crush Citadel and the other shorts, letting the DTCC/Fed auction their carcasses off to address the treasury issue, and buy up the dip on the back end with their (recently disclosed) high cash reserves.

In one fell swoop, they could crush all the enemies of the status quo, bolster their book of business with new clients and investments, maintain the sanctity of the market, make all retail investors happy, and catch the dip on the back end. America's reputation survives, the dollar remains the global reserve currency, the economy is stimulated by retail reinvestment into their communities, the government collects trillions in taxes, and a conversation about the bigger systemic problem is avoided. Now, I know what you're thinking. The depth of the fuckery at play here almost makes it seem as though the whole damn thing should be torn down. And it SHOULD. But that would hurt, hurt bad, and hurt for a real long time.

Which brings me to my last point. Why on Earth would the SEC give Citadel an exemption that allows for the destruction of records and falsification of documents? Well, you're gonna hate this thought experiment, but put yourself in Kenny G's shoes for a moment. You're in WAY over your head, there's no way out, and your firm is fucksville no matter what. Yeah, you can bring the whole damn thing down with you, that's an option. But there would be people out for literal fucking blood. What if the government/SEC/Fed/Blackrock extended you a lifeline and said ""ok check it out. Citadel goes quietly into the dark night, we give you the green light to destroy all records about you literally shorting the United States of America, and we won't come after you criminally or go after your personal assets. All you've gotta do publicly and repeatedly confirm that GME was a one-in-a-forever outlier responsible for this recession, then shut the fuck up forever."" Sounds like a pretty good deal to me.

So, to summarize, in this situation:

&#x200B;

**TLDR: Blackrock, RC Ventures, the Fed, the government, the SEC, the DTCC, or any combination of the aforementioned could very well be conspiring to use the GME play to bankrupt and pillage every GME shorty (and likely every treasury shorty if there are others besides Citadel) to offset the financial damage done and maintain global public sentiment. The potential fallout for not employing a coordinated strategy here is untenable. You'd be talking a global ""max pain"" scenario. But if cooperating, only shorties would die, Blackrock and other longs would come out well ahead, retail gets PAID and reinvests/spends, government gets paid and doesn't look UTTERLY incompetent, the dollar remains reserve currency and hyperinflation is averted. And hopefully, legislation and regulation reform follow, but crisis averted! For now...**

546,AMC Entertainment (AMC) Stock Highlights Corruption On Wall Street,1620083967.0,,2021-05-03 16:19:27,EGOD! 🚀🚀🚀,1615035193.0,,2021-03-06 05:53:13,546,Gamestop pressure cooker- MOASS is inevitable - Stay Calm and HODL,1616307567.0,"I've been increasing my positions since jumping on in January with 8 shares for roughly 2400. Amidst all the fuckery, the price went down steadily and I held throughout. At the time, I thought I would sell around tax time and take the deduction as a loss. Meanwhile there were many posts of averaging down and I thought why would I do that? And then we saw GME start to rise. At that point I upped my ante and yolo'd $40,000 and bought as many shares as I could when it approached $140. I continue to buy shares and am up to 421 shares at an amount of money that would take me awhile to make back.  I've watched my unrealized gains go up as high as $60,000 when the price neared $340.

I Didnt sell one share.

Why?

Well I've been using hooked on phonics and started reading news on what's been happening at Gamestop and found:

1. Ryan Cohen was asked to join the board, he never forced his way in
2. Two additional seats were added which are occupied with people close to Ryan from Chewy
3. Their board consists of 13 and I found an article on Barron's about the future of the board:

[https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-will-add-activist-investors-to-the-board-the-stock-shot-up-51610384385](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-will-add-activist-investors-to-the-board-the-stock-shot-up-51610384385)

Quote from that article:

The company (ticker: GME) reached a deal with Chewy co-founder Ryan  Cohen’s RC Ventures. Cohen, as well as former Chewy executives Alan  Attal and Jim Grube, will join the company's board, now at 13 members.  Cohen holds 13% of GameStop shares, according to a recent filing with  the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K. Symancyk and Kathy  Vrabeck told the board they don’t plan to stand for reelection at the  company’s annual meeting in June. The **board will shrink to nine** members  following that meeting. ""

So my ape brain with limited reading skills sees this as several board members are **lame ducks**. Those **lame ducks will be leaving** in a short period of time and their duties are limited to those essential for the position they are in, they are not making long term strategic planning of the company.

The CFO is on the way out March 26th and it just so happens that new board member Jim Grube was the CFO of Chewy 2015-2018. Coincidence?

Announcement of  Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee  to lead transformation-  Alan Attal, Ryan Cohen, and Kurt Wolf ---  Notice who is missing from that? The current CEO George Sherman. Coincidence?

Announcement of newly created CTO Chief Technology Officer- Matt Francis (Edit Harris to Francis thanks Eating\_\_Crayons) from senior position with **Amazon** Web Services --- The man was making BANK

Announcement of  Senior Vice President of Customer Care – Kelli Durkin, who previously served as **Chewy’s** Vice President of Customer Service

Announcement of  Vice President of Fulfillment - Josh Krueger from **Amazon** \- Another heavy hitter making bank who will oversee the management of e-commerce fulfillment centers.

So how can you attract big talent from a company like Amazon that were so nicely compensated to Gamestop when so many people were betting on them going bankrupt and shorting their stock? Because there is something major going on and it is being led by Ryan Cohen and it does not look like it will include George Sherman staying on as CEO. The media blackout by the board up until their earnings call this Tuesday has made so many people on edge.

**Who do you think is on the sharpest of edges???**

They rhyme with edge...

Ok... ok... It is the hedge funds and market makers that have shorted Gamestop (Melvin and Citadel).

With the transformation underway already, many Whales and long term investors have read in between the lines and see that GME is no longer a $4 stock, or a $40-50 stock, or a $200 stock. GME will be in the $600-$1000 range soon. So what does that mean? Many big $$$ investors are jumping in and those that have not will soon be on board. They won't miss out.

Why is that important to retail? Well for us retail investors, we have to HODL. We have to not sell and keep the line. By us keeping our positions and not selling for a few dollars profit, the **SHORT SELLERS CANNOT CLOSE** their positions. But more importantly as the big $$$ investors hop on which will be soon, they will be buying shares in bulk 100k 200k orders etc. What that is going to do is shove a big green dildo up Melvin and Citadel's ass that they absolutely won't recover from and the DTCC will liquidate them ===========(MOASS). The long term investors wont sell for a quick profit and us retail will be able to sell for a huuuuuuge profit!!!!

The absolute irony of it is that both Melvin and Citadel were betting on GME and other companies to go under and that they will be the ones in the end that do not make it out!!!

**Edit 1- I replied to quite a few comments but wanted to add the Twitter info I referred to for the Citadel twitter accounts I found. Each account has gone silent since January 26th. If they were out of the squeeze, these accounts would be active:**

As such the series of events that will happen provided apes hold is as follows:

Case for THE FEEDBACK LOOP if we buy & not sell:

Apes hold and buy ---> 20 bucks eventually ---> 
(At this point, some will sell, LOOP broken, no more $2000 per share as destination)


(fortunately we all hold and not sell, and buy more)
apes buy and hold ---> shorts become unprofitable and need to cover (short ladder attacks will happen don't panic, this will increase short interest) --> options get struck allowing more shares to be taken off the market ---> higher volatility ---> higher price 
--->apes hold and buy --> 40 bucks --> 
(At this point, some will sell, LOOP broken, no more $2000 per share as destination)


(fortunately we all hold and not sell, and buy more)
same cycle ---> this time with failure to delivers compounding ---> apes hold and buy ---> 80 bucks 
(At this point, some will sell, LOOP broken, no more $2000 per share as destination)


(fortunately we all hold and not sell, and buy more)
--> S.C (same cycle) ---> 200 --> A.H.B (apes hold and buy) and media gets involved with news headlines such as  ""GME 2.0 ? AMC"" like headlines ---> buying frenzy ---> 400 --> more media attention, more buying failure to delivers etc --> 2000, until whatever price apes mass sell and failure to deliver is met.


Will the above scenario actually happen is we apes really all hold and buy, all buy and hold and not sell whatever and how ever high the price until $2000?

I'd like to spend my earnings on things that people take for granted daily like a car for myself and my mum, and pay off debts for her too hopefully.

Why we need to increase the volume this week! What is the effect of the May 4th meeting!

As most of y’all heard AMC is having a shareholder meeting on May 4th to discuss multiple different things, most importantly for us, the 500,000,000 Class A Common Stock shares. They will have a vote on INCREASING THE LIMIT on the amount of shares available by 500,000,000. They are NOT ISSUING shares, and even if they did, that would take months.

Another important reason about this meeting, is this is what we all wanted to happen. We wanted them to have a shareholders meeting so they can count all the shares and send invites. So why is this important, well if you are new or have not been paying attention, the hedgies have been creating fake shares and have been using them drive the price down with short laddering. THIS IS ILLEGAL! If caught with fake shares, they could result to fines, license suspension, criminal charges, and also negative PR from the media. With GameStop and AMC all over the media, being caught doing something illegal could destroy that company’s reputation. So expect the hedgies try to buy back those fake shares before they start the head count. From what I read online and other discussions, this will start after closing on March 11 through March 19th. (Which is also the quadruple witching day).

Now here is the best part. Some of us own the fake shares that they created, and they need to buy them back from us. But we got 💎🙌, and we ain’t scared of these hedgies anymore. It is more annoying that they are wasting our time to go to the moon! We know we are winning and just waiting on them to give up.

So this is what to expect this week. Since the count doesn’t officially start until after Thursday close, look for the hedgies to go ALL OUT next week. They NEED our shares, so they will play mind games and try to make us panic. Look for them to drive the price down to the $6 range. Look for the media to continuously talk negative about AMC. Look for more manipulation.

Now here’s how we can counter attack. Buy, buy buy and hold, hold, hold. We need to buy up all the remaining shares, both real and fake. With 4 days until the count, how many more fake shares do you expect them create? So we need to clean out their arsenal and use our 💎🙌 and HOLD! They’ve been trying to scare us, let’s scare them.

Now here’s another mind game you need to be prepared for next week. And that is seeing the stock price jump up to double digits. Be prepared for a price increase as well as a price decrease. REMEMBER THEY NEED TO BUY THE SHARES WE ARE HOLDING! So they may let the price increase so that you sell for a profit. Especially the paper hands that have been holding and panicking for weeks. Some of them will sell at the first sight of profit and will cash out right when it starts going up. This is EXACTLY what the hedgies want! They want us to sell so they can buy back those shares. It’s cheaper to buy shares at $15 as compared to $500. So if you see the price increase, DO NOT SELL! Continue to have 💎🙌 and HOLD! The longer we hold, the higher it goes!

I’ve seen stories on here how people will use this money. I’ve seen some about expensive medical bills for themselves, their kids, or pets. I’ve seen some about paying off their debts so they can have a reset in life, I’ve seen some about being able to afford to go to school, or pay for rent and food. I’ve seen some about setting up their families for life. I’ve seen some as payback for 2008 for the experience they had to deal with and how their parents got screwed by Wall Street. I’ve seen some people wanting to afford nice things that they could’ve only dreamed of like buying a house, new car, new wife or husband, lambos, etc...

We all have goals and aspirations for this squeeze, and this could be a historic squeeze that can change the transfer of wealth from the 1% to us 🦍. We are doing this for EACH OTHER!

 So when you see the price going up! Remember who you are fighting for. Remember what you are fighting for. Remember why you are fighting for this opportunity. 

Also remember how the hedge funds wanted to bankrupt these companies in a middle of a pandemic just so they can make 100% of the gain and avoid paying taxes. They illegally dropped the price down day after day and we watched our portfolio go red. So remember the hardship we had to go through just to get this opportunity. They didn’t care about our money, so we shouldn’t care about theirs. LETS TAKE ALL OF IT!

So remember we need to BUY, BUY, BUY AND HOLD! Always remember to only buy what you can afford.

This is not financial advise, this is 💎🙌🦍 advise!

This is life advice from someone who's been there, I've made and spent over 7 figures, mistakes I've made, and what I've learned. I'm not telling you what to do, just trying to give advice from a friend who's been in your shoes.

1. Taxes. Please don't forget about taxes, you will have to pay them for your gains this year. If you make a million dollars on GME and blow it on a house and 3 cars and a $100k video game room, you will still owe the government money come next tax season. The exception however is if you reinvest it in things during the rest of the year, some of those things can be written off, I won't get into it in detail, but you should look more into this if you're looking to reinvest your money. Couple hundred bucks some meetings with good accountants are nothing when you just made over a million.
2. Fair weather friends / relationships. If you tell people ""I just made a million dollars"" guess who's going to suddenly have a lot more ""friends""? They won't be your real friends. Your real friends and the people who really love and care about you, are the ones that had your back when you had nothing, DO NOT FORGET ABOUT THEM. Just because some hot girl wants you this week for your fat wallet doesn't mean you need to forget about the girl who took care of you when you were down on your luck and lost your job. Also don't always be the guy who's \*got the tab\* buys everyone dinner, rounds of drinks on a regular basis, etc. These things add up. $500 to buy everyone dinner 2x a week is $50,000 a year. That's 5% of your net worth. I knew a guy that did this, he's on disability and government assistance right now, he has nothing. Great guy, bad with money.
3. Philanthropy. It's great to give, but take care of yourself first. Make sure you're set for taxes, set yourself up a cushion for the future first. YOU are important, YOU should come first, and then give charitably (also a tax write off). Also some charities are scams (yes, scummy), I like to use sites like Charity Navigator to see where the money is actually going, the last thing you want is to bankrupt a hedge fund and turn around and give it to a greedy charity scamming CEO that's even worse.
4. Investing. Reinvest in your future, but do it smart. $1mil isn't that much money, if you don't work, don't invest, and just spend you'll be out in several years. Whether you invest in passive income (real estate you rent out, more stocks (please remember GME is once in a lifetime, this thing doesn't happen every week don't get scammed), starting a small business, or you just invest in yourself by going back to school for something you couldn't afford before, reinvest at least some of it so you're set for the future. YOU can answer this better than I can, you know what you love, but don't get so passionate about something that you fail to see the numbers indicating poor ROI and invest poorly, sometimes passion projects (like starting an indie studio, for you gamers) can be money pits that fail. Invest, but make sure it's a financially sound investment, not just all passion project.
5. It goes fast. Really I can't stress this enough. In the 50's, a million dollars was worth way more than it is now, you don't realize this until you have it, spend it, and say ""wait what the F\*\*K where did all the money go???"". If you're at 5-10 mil you should be pretty set to afford some mistakes along the way, just always keep that little guy in the back of your head that goes ""hey, you're burning through this too fast, slow down and think smarter""

Sorry if I seem ""preachy"", again it's going to be YOUR money do what you want, I just don't want to see my new friends (you) make mistakes and wind up in the poorhouse again, because that's what the 1% is betting is going to happen. They've underestimated us once, and I'm hoping we prove them wrong again, when we don't wind up in the poorhouse in 5 years but instead become the new rich.

I'm out, have a good rest of your day :)

EDIT: Thank you for the awards and upvotes, I am honored and hope that this helps some of you make sound financial decisions and enrich your life going forward. <3",2021-03-10 11:48:22

I will again preface this by saying This is all publicly available via facebook, linkedin, wikipedia and google.

For those of you that don’t know. I wrote a DD about 25 days ago letting everybody know that firing Jim Bell was a GOOD thing. See - https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lrfvlq/jim_bell_is_a_his_firing_is_good_and_bullish/

I’ve done some more digging into his “sudden” departure. 

Let’s recap. 

Step 1: Go to company, become CFO
Step 2: Make horribly dumbass decisions
Step 3: Company goes under (Profit!) Gets nice bonus from Company going under and then another from Citadel for a job well done. 
Step 4: Repeat

Ok. But now get this! Jim Bell was added to the board of directors June 2019. Prior to him being added to the board, many longs that had shorts loaned OUT recalled their shares.  (Melvin WAS LONG AT THIS TIMEFRAME but had their shares loaned out!) but when it came to VOTING JIM BELL ONTO THE BOARD AS CFO. These fuckers needed their shares BACK to ensure Jim was voted and confirmed as CFO! Which is why GME saw a slight recovery in March-June 2019. (Which is why I’m BULLISH ON SHARES BEING RECALLED)

THEN The FTDs and Shorts in the company EXPLODED after that shareholder meeting because Jim was facilitating it from the inside. He likely got other members of the board ON BOARD which is why he and they did such shitty jobs at letting the company basically run itself into the ground. Especially during the pandemic which was a PERFECT COVER and why he “failed” to act in the best interest of the company!

Then when Ryan Cohen came on board. This Jim Bell mother fucker and 3 of his inside cronies basically tried to do a HOSTILE TAKEOVER to either get RC OUT or at least block him from getting his friends on board and ruining their plans to BANKRUPT GME and FUCKING FAILED. Look at the signature of the reporting person. 

https://imgur.com/Sbj2WaQ

https://imgur.com/Ttm76rN

https://imgur.com/JT3THYW

All those members are also leaving the company of their “own good will” yeah because they fucking tried to stab the company in the back and RC is basically kicking their asses OUT for their failed takeover.

Jesus I wish the media would investigate this shit. What these people did is basically MALICIOUS insider trading with Melvin and Citadel.

Remember I’m just some guy on the internet doing google, Facebook, LinkedIn and Wikipedia searches. I'm not a financial advisor. I am not a cop or a reporter. I am NOT a cat. In fact I could be COMPLETELY WRONG. Please point out flaws if I am wrong! Most importantly, Do your OWN DD.

Edit 1: Also I can’t find SHIT on the CEO. He hasn’t said jack shit to ANYONE for 6 months. For all we know this guy is dead and they could literally be pulling a “Weekend at Bernies” with this guy at this point until RC is made CEO (Which IS a rumor going around)

Edit 2: Some good questions in the comments. When you get home from work I’ll answer the stronger ones like - “What do you mean a slight recovery?” - - - Gotta zoom in! It did not last long but it did happen. Look at the highs and lows for each day and while June did end lower, there was a run up just before it before being shorted into the dirt again. It wasn’t a very big recovery but it was there. 

Also “who are these 3 people? How do you know they are leaving?”- - - I should have linked my source on that besides the SEC filings. But Jim Bell is their LAWYER which is why I said check the signature of the reporting person. It’s Jim Bell. 
When I get to my home PC I will post about the 3 resigning unless I can dig it up on my phone during my lunch. I’ll update again later.

 u/veradico states this below in the comments 
“Small point of correction here. Jim Bell is not an attorney. He has an MBA and a BS in econ. He does not have a law degree.

What you're seeing on these forms is that he signed as their ""Attorney in Fact,"" which simply means these three executed what is called a ""Power of Attorney,"" which gave Mr. Bell the power to sign legal documents on their behalf.”

Update 4: Found it on my break - https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-additional-board-refreshment-accelerate

“ Effective immediately and through the Annual Meeting, GameStop’s Board of Directors will expand from 10 members to 13 members. Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K. Symancyk and Kathy Vrabeck have each informed the Board that they do not intend to stand for reelection at the Annual Meeting. As such, the Board will be reduced to nine members following the Annual Meeting.”

Update 5: I missed this DD 5 days ago by u/Veschor  -https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6itgf/rcs_gme_roadmap_predictions/ -  but it corroborates my DD on the 🐍s getting thrown out of GME. Thank you sir for your work.",2021-03-22 06:28:53

This has never been a subject but now all of a sudden it’s all anyone talks about. MAKE SURE YOU READ THIS!!!,1616786700.0,"This community has seen shills and shorts project their desires onto this sub through random and coordinated posts regarding certain subjects. We saw it with weed stocks. We saw it with silver. We saw it with SI %. We saw it was SSR. The craze nowadays seems to be taxes. 

Why? Why would anyone be concerned with taxes if we all are HODLing? Have you even reached 10% of your floor price yet? The only time taxes become a problem is after you S-E-L-L. In my opinion, this is another coordinated psychological attack to get the thought of selling back into everyone’s heads once again. This past week I saw more “I’m never selling, go fuck yourself Hedge Funds” posts then I’ve ever seen before. Yet now all of a sudden when the thought of taxes come into play, the potential to “never sell” changes. Now we see posts saying “I can wait to pay taxes!” In no way do I think the authors of all these posts intend to help facilitate such a thought process, but I guarantee you some of them do and it’s important that we realize this. 

Hedge funds and Market Makers have done what they want for too long. They’ve created a system that’s bastardized capitalism into a predatory tool to keep the rich rich, the powerful powerful, and the poor poor. This isn’t an America problem. This is a global problem that will only continue unless people like you and me wake up and really start questioning the REASONS behind EVERYTHING. 

Why would companies like Robinhood come along and offer commission free investing? Is it really to democratize trading... or is it to provide an insanely unfair advantage to those that feel their power slightly slipping? Why would billionaires and other hedge funds come to our supposed “aid”? Do they care about the average investor and the struggles he or she has had to face just to exist? Or do they see it as an opportunity to... remain rich, remain powerful. Why am I posting this? Do I care about people in this sub or do I have some angle I am playing? QUESTION. EVERYTHING. 

This whole GME experience has been a blast and though I don’t have much hope in humanity as a whole as of late, you guys inspire the fuck out of me. The insane amount of effort people like rensole, warden, pixel, and so many others put in is nothing short of amazing. Keep up the positivity, but as things inevitably start improving for GME investors around the world, STAY VIGILANT. Things that are seemingly pointless could easily have massive unintended consequences. 

Don’t believe me? Just look at the story of GME. It went from the forced bankrupting of a failing company, to the revitalization of said company and the impending bankruptcy of some of the most powerful companies in the world. 

TL;DR - Taxes only matter when you sell. If you’re not close to selling then don’t worry about taxes. Question everything and make sure others are too. Certain trends don’t establish themselves in important threads like r/GME for no reason.

Ryan Cohen owns 9M shares. He also knows all the institutional players that own large portions. He also has access to a Bloomberg terminal and can see that institutions own 115% of the total number of shares. Ryan also knows that the Reddit community is huge and also has a TON of shares.

So why does this matter? Because he has the ability to do a few things which absolutely would destroy the shorts/synthetic shares. And why would he want to do that? Well, his 9 million shares at $200 = $1.8B. At $2,000/share his total is $18B, etc. This continued fuckery is messing with his giant stake as much as anyone.

So what can Ryan do as quickly as this earnings call?

1. He could offer a special one-time dividend to every share. Rocket mortgage did this and it sent their stock through the roof. And who pays that dividend. All those short positions do.
2. He could issue a stock split (ie 10 shares for 1). So everyone would instantly have 10X the amount of stock. Why would this matter? Because at just $20, everyone can easily join the revolution. Those $20 shares would likely accelerate to $40-50 quickly. That acceleration would trigger the April 16th Call Options train further crushing the shorts/synthetic shares.
3. He can recall the shares (actually likely) so they can vote on a new board. Recalling the shares exposes this synthetic share issue front and center.
4. GameStop can report outstanding revenue and show guidance that convinces everyone that the market cap calculation is way too low.
5. As the market cap for GameStop increases (either through the shares, better game plan, execution, etc), GameStop will be put into more and more ETFs.

What does this all mean? Just enjoy the weekend and chill. The short/synthetic problem is worsening. Do you know what you do when your opponent is killing himself? You let him continue to do that.

We don't need to do anything but wait until the conference call that happens after hours on Tuesday. It's likely, Ryan Cohen does at least a few of these and I expect the guidance going forward to be stellar.

I haven’t seen this talked about anywhere so I want to make sure apes are aware of what’s going on on a Federal level right now in the USA. We’re all wondering where the actual FUCK the SEC is in all this, and I think I may have found a clue. 

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen called a random ass [meeting of the minds](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/fsoc/council-meetings) yesterday in the form of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) which was established in 2010. [List of members in attendance](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/min0gb/the_holders_of_the_boss_key_wondering_who_is_at/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) I’m not getting out in the weeds with technicals here, that’s what these other smart apes are here for. Just know that this group, a panel that consists of top regulators from SEC, Fed Reserve, NYSE, and Big Brother alphabet forces... has been tasked with **Policing Wall Street Behavior that has the potential to crash the entire economy.** *This is not a new statement, but it is relevant to why it was revived.* 

Now, the mainstream media keeps saying that the focus of this meeting was [climate change](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/31/yellen-climate-change-fsoc-478769) (insert eye roll for buzzwords- it’s also carefully worded to say a market crash could be caused by the aftermath of the pandemic) but some interesting things have developed from it. Jerome Powell, the Fed Reserve Chair (the guy that makes the money printer go brrrrr) has “presided over the formation of 2 internal committees on “climate risk”- one on issues of relevance to bank examiners, and *the other on potential risks posed to the stability of the entire financial system*, the type that’s of most interest to FSOC.

Now, the good shit... The climate change part was an open meeting. But the meeting’s agenda included a [closed door deliberation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/yellen-signals-scrutinizing-hedge-funds-is-a-renewed-fsoc-focus-kmxuj4hu) on open end mutual funds and hedge fund activities.

O~~ era team of high officials within the council that will *scrutinize hedge funds in particular*, and will also look at ways of making funding markets that serve as the lifeblood of the financial sector more resilient. THE LAST TIME THIS GROUP MET WAS IN 2016.

[Here's the press release ](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/TreasuryStatement.pdf)

Also of note from the document: 

The group received an updated presentation from the Office of Financial Research about Hedge Fund activities. So they got to sit through a hedgie slideshow of fuckery. (Do you think any of our DDs made it on a slide? 🧐😂)

**“The council also discussed recent market developments related to hedge fund activities”**

“Chairperson Yellen asked interagency staff to assess potential financial stability risks associated with open-end funds, particularly focusing on **LIQUIDITY RISKS**.”


So, why am I posting this here? What does this have to do with GME? Well, nothing directly. At least, not as presented. First of all, words have meaning in a legal document, every single one. And I noticed a few little blips that refer to CURRENT MARKET FUCKERY BEING INVESTIGATED. I know the press is covering this meeting as just another day at the office for Yellen, but IT HASN’T MET SINCE 2016. WHY NOW?!?! *political speculation gets involved here and thats not what this post is about. I'm not saying it's directly because of GME, but it sure seems to be a sudden priority in a notoriously slow responding gov't*

Do the cops release details when they’re investigating a murder? No. Then the murderer might destroy the weapon and flee the country, maybe even burn down the neighborhood while he’s at it. You don’t show your hand at the poker table til the dealing’s done. 

My opinion as a crayon smoking apette? I think the Everything Short DD was spot on. I think Michael Burry has been trying to warn us for 18+ months that it’s imminent... and I think the US government is trying to get ahead of a fucking speeding freight train headed directly for our $USD. They have every reason to stop this cancer before it fully penetrates and evaporates US treasury bonds. I think they’ve known since pre-January squeeze that this was inevitable, but our little diamond hands on our GME just forced their hand. THIS IS NOT RETAIL INVESTOR’S FAULT. We didn’t create this, and we aren’t responsible for the resulting explosion just because we are the ones that exposed the fuckery! We are individual investors with individual reasons for liking the stock. 

But boy, oh boy do I like it more every day. 

💎🙌🏼🚀

TL;DR: Remember❗Hedgies aren't just shorting GME to oblivion. They've been doing this to US Treasury Bonds. Particularly 10 year ones. If that implodes, then the government can no longer guarantee the value of its own dollar, because those ""insurance policies"" i.e. US bonds are worthless=Dollar go boom 💥 Treasury Secretary Yellen called a meeting to seemingly stop that boom.",2021-04-01 15:10:05

575,YOU'VE BEEN POOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE.,1622346269.0,"Now that I've got your attention let's talk about the 100k-500k potential AMC has. Let's be honest here, the vast majority of AMC share holders are everyday people, we have never been able to afford the greatest luxuries in life. With that being established, we now have a WINNING lottery ticket in our hands. We have guaranteed life changing money comming our way. Now alot of people out there are saying ""sell at whatever price point you want"" that may be true but why the fuck would you sell at 50, 100, 100, 1000, 10000, etc. If you could be GUARANTEED 100K PLUS PER SHARE. If you just. Held. On. A. Little. Longer. 


Life is not fair. And anyone whole tells you otherwise is lying to themselves. But for once we got the mother fucking CHEAT CODE. This leads me back to the title, you've been poor your whole fucking life. You put down × amount of money and now have the potential to change your life and the lives of generations to come. So don't tell me you can't hold on for a week, two weeks , a month, even a fucking year to get that massive paycheck. I'd wait 10 years if I knew I'd be apart of the 1% in the world. This is literally a once in a lifetime opportunity, don't piss it away for a measly 1 thousand per share. HOLD THE FUCKING LINE. THERE IS NO LIMIT. The only person holding you back is yourself. We are about to see more money than we've ever seen in our lives. We are taking from the megawealthy who could give two fucks about what happens to you. They don't want you to succeed, THEY ARE BETTING AGAINST YOU. They don't care that you're living paycheck to paycheck or that you or your family member cant afford their medical bills and are in crippling debt. So why dip your finger in the honeypot when we can take the whole fucking hive? 

All that being said, I love this community and the commrodery we all share. I just do not want us to sell ourselves short. Hold for the APES that could only afford a few shares. Hold for eachother. What would you do if you never had to work another day in your life and could finally breath for once? The future is yours.

I have seen similar glitches before, but usually only for a single bar/candle. Not dozens over the span of an hour, and across multiple platforms. I will ask around and look into this further and update if I can acquire any more information. For now, take this analysis with numerous grains of salt, but also know that this does not change my psychological conclusions regarding potential SEC/government action. But I would be remiss to not update this as more info arises.





**Alright listen up, y'all. If you don't have an aneurysm halfway through, you might just end up with a couple extra wrinkles.**

Okay fine, I'll preface this by admitting that, technically, the SEC/gov could still intervene. But it would be an extraordinarily bad idea. If you've read any of my previous stuff, you know I love me some Moneyball, and to quote Jonah Hill: ""This is the kind of decision that gets you fired.""([https://youtu.be/CR\_yS6IxB-c](https://youtu.be/CR_yS6IxB-c)) I genuinely believe that today we experienced an inflection point so egregious, so blatant, that anyone on the side of the shorts in this trade will be committing career suicide.

Most of my due diligence revolves around market psychology, and I rarely delve into technical analysis, as I'm of the mind that it usually only serves to tell you how much you don't know rather than anything actionable, but in this case I'm gonna make an exception, so let's kick this off with some numbers before we dive into the touchy-feely bullshit. In the immortal words of Nickelback, ""LOOK AT THIS GRAAAAPH""

[Huehuehue](https://preview.redd.it/uvzck3z2t9m61.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d7a51e936c3e8283c6550d366e7f73f8d307df34)

Notice anything funny? I sure hope so, because I have never, in my life, seen anything quite like it. What you're seeing here, to use scientific terminology, is the stock market equivalent of a mother slapping her petulant child and yelling ""KNOCK IT THE FUCK OFF.""

While it's possible there were some retail paper hands exiting during this insanity, all signs point to this being an all-out war between the shorts and their big brothers and whales that are on our side of this trade. What you're seeing here is a small number of institutions viciously duking it out. There is some compelling info floating around that some whales were assisting the shorts around noon, as evidenced by the quick turnaround right after the drop, but that was to be expected. When you look at what starts taking place around 2:00, that's when things get interesting.

That first green candle screams ""hurr hurr we can do this shit too, we'll put it right back to where you started shorting,"" followed by a temper tantrum represented by the first giant red candle. The gap between that first exchange and the shitstorm that follows is likely explained by the big boys that are long going ""Really? REALLY? Okay then, free up some capital, it's on now."" Then all hell breaks loose. Massive (for a one-on-one battle, not normal hourly volume), rapid, aggressive high-frequency trading that you can't make heads or tails of, other than the most important detail (and the only one that matters): The tops and bottoms of these candles mostly line up.

**How I interpret this:**

Institutional longs are fed the fuck up. They are saying without saying, in no uncertain terms, ""Cut it the fuck out. It doesn't matter how long this DTCC rule change takes, because until then we'll hold you accountable for your fuckery."" People have been explaining for weeks now that in an unprecedented scenario such as this, price simply does not matter, and this is a perfect example. The real price during that time of extreme volatility is the stock market equivalent of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. The real price of the stock for that 45 minute window is essentially any price along any of those bars. It only becomes real when you observe it, and not too many of us have a Bloomberg terminal just chilling in the living room. So, for now, it would be prudent not to attribute any level of importance to price alone. You're far better served looking for DD about more tangible data than anything having to do with charts or technical analysis.

&#x200B;

**So what's this mean for us?**

In the video I linked above, the SEC (played by Brad Pitt) states: ""It's a problem you think we have to explain ourselves. Don't. To anyone."" A fine sentiment....but only as long as you're right. In most cases, being on the wrong side of history will end up biting you in the ass, and this is no exception. As I've said countless times before, this is not 2008. 2008 did not transpire in real-time. 2008 did not have the eyes of the world upon it. 2008 was a post-mortem, and by the time people figured out what the fuck just happened, they were too busy worrying about where their next meal was gonna come from. Well, sorry, we're stuck inside with nothing better to do, waiting on pitiful stimulus checks, and we already have decades of getting creative with Top Ramen under our belts.

It's one thing to try to explain why this situation is unprecedented using spreadsheets of short interest data or long-since-forgotten short squeeze comparisons. It's another to be able to point at a graph and say ""EVER SEEN SOME SHIT LIKE THAT BEFORE?"" This is just the latest in a months-long string of manipulation, disinformation, lying, and outright fraud, but it's easily one of the most damning. Any idiot can take one glance at that and realize it's like nothing they've ever seen. They may not give a fuck until half their portfolio disappears, but when it does, they're gonna start asking questions.

I've been saying for a while now that I don't think the SEC/Government understands the implications of what they're dealing with here. It would be truly insane for them to intervene on the side of the hedge funds, but I considered it a much higher probability before today. This wild graph perfectly encapsulates the danger posed by ruling the wrong way on this one. 2008 was strike one, January was strike two, and this would be a colossal strike three. The institutions on the long side with us are signaling very clearly that they agree. Not only would perpetuating the myth of fairness in our markets be deadly to retail investment, possibly forever, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if big players like Blackrock, Vanguard, and Fidelity sent their business elsewhere.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: Even the SEC and government should now be able to recognize that the squeeze is good for everyone except the shorts (except Steve Cohen who's fat as shit and could use a nice lil squizzle). HODL, you magnificent bastards. No matter how this shakes out, it will go down as one of the most monumental economic events of the century. Hopefully the SEC/government recognize this, because if not, well....this has the markings of a complete paradigm shift all over it.

edit: yeah, saying you aren't selling at x thousand is easy because compared to the price now thats already unfathomable gains. but when its at x thousand and drops to x/2 thousand, THATS when we need to diamond hand even harder. THATS when you need to eliminate the thought of it being over because it is not. we determine the price. we can choose to determine that it will be 100k+. but if we all chicken out at 5k, then we chose 5k to be our demand rather than 100k.

The amount of whining I’ve heard in the last 24 hours is fucking pathetic, and you should all be ashamed of yourselves and the failures you’ve become. Listening to y’all is worse than the most unenthusiastic, driest, toothiest, herpes-infestedest blowjob on the fucking planet. 

&nbsp;

Judging by your responses to my last post, most of you are incapable or unwilling to read some simple fucking sentences telling you to go eat dogshit, so I’m going to try out of the goodness of my benevolent heart to bestow wisdom on you grabasstic fuckclowns one more time. 

&nbsp;

No, we did not squeeze yesterday and we did not squeeze today. [As I said previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m375cb/chill_the_fuck_out_you_basic_bitches_were_gonna/), **THAT’S FUCKING OKAY.** It’s ok for me personally because I didn’t invest more than I could afford to lose unlike some of you useless bottomfeeders. It’s also ok for me personally because, while the theory about the call options did not come true, that was just one of a ton of elevating factors that I’m using to determine whether a squeeze can rip the microtesticles off of the hedge funds. 

&nbsp;

Now before I continue I want to make something crystal clear to you, twinkletits. **I am not and nor have I advised that any of you should buy, that any of you should hold, or that any of you should pussy out and panic sell like the drooling bitches I know you are. That would be financial advice, and even though I struggle to stuff my massive dick into my pants every morning, I’m not a financial advisor.** Financial advisors cost a shitload of money per hour, more than you or your wife’s six boyfriends can afford, the dirty little minx. You think one of them would come onto the internet and share their profession for fucking free? Do you also think that plants grow upward because they are seeking the motherfucking word of God?

&nbsp;

 Here’s your first bit of knowledge: anyone offering you free financial advice and telling you to buy probably already has a sizeable long position, and stands to benefit materially from your dumb asses piling into their pump-and-dump. Anyone telling you to sell probably has a sizeable short position, and stands to rake your moronic asses over the fire because you can’t be bothered to look shit up for yourself. They’re like gas station sushi or your mom telling me I don’t need to use a condom with her cuz she’s clean – I don’t trust that shit. 

&nbsp;

Listen up, Cuckleberry Finn. I’m about to make several claims in this post which I believe to be true based upon the extensive research I’ve done over the last few weeks. I know you haven’t done that research, because you’re standing there with your mouth open reading this fucking post. Your job is not to follow these claims blindly because let’s face it, you don’t know your left hand from your right hand, you don’t know your cock from your taint, and you don’t know if these are true or horseshit. It is your fucking job to research these claims and figure out whether they hold water, then make your own decisions. You’ve done a lackluster job in life running on your own decisions so far – fucking change that. 

&nbsp;

There’s a whole stack of shit going down that says something ain’t right with the rainbow bears. A lot of things are happening nearly at the same time, and these events all conflagrating simmmmmmultaneously tell me that I’m going to make some sick fucking cash come tendie judgement day. I’m going to include links because you NEET little bitchtits are too lazy and shiftless to plow keywords into a motherfucking search engine. Oh, and more items like these will probably pop up over the weekend. Don’t worry, Daddy bikebike will be here to harass you as you fail to comprehend what they mean. 

&nbsp;

#IN NO WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM AM I PREDICTING THE SQUEEZE TO HAPPEN ON ANY OF THESE DATES. I JUST SEE A LOT OF SHIT DROPPING FROM GOD'S ASSHOLE AT THE SAME TIME AND I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD KEEP MY EYE ON IT. DON'T PEG AN ABSOLUTE DATE TO ANYTHING YOU VACUOUS CUNTS. 

&nbsp;

1. Stimulus checks are dropping starting this weekend, and [a whopping 40% - 50% of those polled plan to put half of that delicious stimmie money in the stock market.]( https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stimulus-checks-young-people-millennials-planning-to-invest-in-stocks-2021-3-1030160755) I wonder if that has anything in common with the 9.5 million mostly new users signing up to /r/wsb.
2. Some wrinklebrained Newton has written up a [shareholder letter]( https://www.stockholdersrights.com/), deliverable to the Gamestop board next week, which demands that they recall all shares to call a vote. If they recall all shares, shorts must cover then and there, and this massive fraud complex is going to be exposed faster than what a failure your life is when you show up to your high school reunion and realize how much better off everyone is doing than you. Last post I linked that shit, I recommended you sign it, and I stand the fuck by that. In fact that is the only thing I’m recommending that you do other than your own DD. 
3. [GME sold a bunch of bonds back in 2016, and those bonds mature on 3/15.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/lx6sbk/gme_bonds_maturing_150321/) Shorts betted that GME would never turn around, so these bonds would never pay out. Bet they’re eating a jizz sandwich courtesy of RC and the boyz. 
4. Congress is getting ready to ram the [long dick of the public beatdown]( https://www.marketwatch.com/story/experts-to-take-aim-at-robinhood-model-during-gamestop-senate-hearing-11615235333) up robinhood and the hedge funds’ asses all over again on 3/17. Do you think Vladdy-waddy’s booty-wooty can handle the onslaught this time? 
5. ~~401(k)’s are [moving out of Melvin Capital on 3/18.]( https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3qvol/melvin_capital_potentially_moving_investors/) But how could this be? Melvin swears up and down, it fucking PWOMISES that it’s doing great. Business has never been better despite it losing 58% of its entire value last month. Well then why the fuck are 401(k)’s divesting from such a fucking winner?~~ corrected by /u/the_captain_slog [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m3xb8r/comment/gqrl6wr) see? I can factor in shit as I find it from other DD's because I'm never stagnant, you shitstains. **ALWAYS BE RESEARCHING AND LEARNING.** 
6. Quadruple Witching Day is still 3/19. These witches ain’t bitches; they know what’s up. They smell blood in the water and can’t wait to menstruate all over these greedy pricks. 
7. The State Street Global Advisors' SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT) [rebalances on 3/19]( https://www.ft.com/content/3d9c8383-a083-44a3-9c7e-54bb36c95a51). 
8. The new DTCC rule is looking at Melvin and Citadel with beer goggles and a throbbing semi.
9. GME is dropping a [phat fucking earnings call on 3/23.]( https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/03/09/2189924/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Fiscal-Year-2020-Earnings-Release-Date.html) I feel like this one’s gonna be hella positive. How many of you cucks have bought Nintendo Switches and shit in the last few months? Don’t tell me you haven’t grabbed an extra Zelda figurine or two to jack off to at night while you listen to your wives slobbering on Chad Thundercock’s meat tornado through the wall. 

&nbsp;

That’s ~~nine~~ eight fucking items, each of which could individually cause a squeeze. So my analysis of the call options was wrong. I’m not a fucking evolutionary economist, but I bet I’m smarter than you diabetic lumps of beef fat. 2 wrong, 8 correct, I’m still listening to the majority here. I still think a squeeze is fucking on, and I’m still deep in this hoe. I’m so convicted that even though I’m only holding 16 (I bought one more today) shares I’m over here taking massive bong rips and dropping more intelligent DD than most of you assblasters can even dream of. 

&nbsp;

Now here’s where your obligations come in. You, you minions of moronity, you chuds of conformity, you basement dwelling larvae, you LOWEST FUCKING COMMON DENOMINATORS, need to assume that everything I just said is total bullshit. You need to go fact-check it. You need to see if there are other factors that could cause this, or other ways that this whole hog-fucking pony show could go tits up. 

&nbsp;

I can think of one. The government could step in and say “party’s over, y’all have to go home now.” Now go do some research as to why or why not that could happen. Betcha there’s a lot more, pro and con. There’s a whole comments section to post them in. I don’t give a fuck what happens to you, but I’m providing you information and a space in which to analyze it. If you choose to cram it up your twats and light it on fire, I can’t and won’t save you from yourselves. 

&nbsp;

It’s fucking incredible, honestly. I heard so much pissing and moaning and dickwringing in the last post. “OMG SQUEEZE WHEN, SHOULD I SELL, SHOULD I BUY, PLEASE TELL ME O DARK LORD, I’M INCAPABLE OF HOLDING MY COCK WHILE I PISS AND NOT BLASTING MYSELF WITH A FRESH STEAMY STREAM OF HOT GOLDEN UREA.”

&nbsp;

Some of you dickskins have an iota of experience, but most of you are clueless, so I’ll dumb down to you. It costs like three ATP molecules to get a grip of your micropenis and use its sad little tip to type “how does the stock market work?” into google. And then you click on shit that you don’t recognize, and you read. You keep clicking on shit till there ain’t any more words that don’t make sense to your pecan-sized protobrains. With any luck, some shit will osmose through your obtuse skulls and you'll become better traders for it. 

&nbsp;

And here’s the deal. Three months ago I wasn’t investing seriously, I wasn’t paying attention, I didn’t know what limit orders were or calls or puts or naked shorts or the DTCC or the SEC or anything. I sacked money away in a normal-ass 401(k), threw a little in Betterment and VTI every month, fucked my girlfriend three times a week in two different positions, bought tickers I didn’t recognize cuz I thought they were funny, and felt great when I made 10%. I thought a hedge fund was the cost you paid a gardener to come trim up your fucking yard because all of you pinche gringos are so allergic to the sun that you dare not venture outside and get your pasty, clammy little hands dirty. But before I threw my hard-earned cash into $GME, I realized the mechanisms of this trade were unlike anything that has ever happened before, and I needed to understand the whirlpool of crazy shit in front of me before jumping in. So I decided it was worth my time to learn about what I would be risking it on. So I researched. I worked hard. Literally 4 to 8 hours a day on average. I hauled ass to move my brain up to a level capable of doing more than drooling on my shirt. I ready every post i could find on wsb, watched every single Roaring Kitty video, and looked up every term i didn't recognize. I'm still not a fucking expert and you get bet your fucking ass I'll be pursuing improvement every day, because I piss excellence and I refuse to half-ass anything. 

&nbsp;
 
So what do you do now? Odds are you aren’t gonna do shit. You’re gonna piss and moan and blame your shitty financial decisions on bad luck while smarter people than you fleece you for all you fucking have. Good luck getting equal visitation rights to your dumbfuck children after that. Nobody likes your kids, by the way, because they were raised by a dumbfuck parent like you. They make C’s, they can’t kick a fucking ball, and they’re going to end up as unremarkable shitstains listening to Top 40 radio, droning away in cubicles, and driving domestic shitboxes that break down every three years. They’ll shit out two to four crotchfruit who are equally worthless and then bumble around for the rest of their lives until the inevitable tide of progress drags them to an ignominious death. Nobody will remember them or you, because they will suck, because y’all fucking suck. You suck at life, you suck at finances, you suck at cooking, you suck at dating, you suck at fucking, and nobody gives a milliliter of syphilitic discharge about you. You COULD change that of course, but that would require effort, something which I’ve realized by now most of y’all are allergic to. You’ll probably just spend the next few years spanking it to furry porn until your choads get calluses, until one day you blink and realize holy fuck you’re 35 and worthless. 

&nbsp;

All of you need to take the crayons out of your turdcutters and use them to draw some fucking charts or something before you eat them. You fucking mutants would make me pray for another worldwide plague, but the current one is taking out population tranches outside of dumbasses, flat-earthers, and anti-vaxxers so I’ll just settle for the hope that Boeings fall out of the sky onto your fucking houses. 

&nbsp;

How about you fucking ask Alexa what 0DTE calls are, or how a credit spread works, or what the fuck delta hedging is, instead of sitting on your widening asses playing Madden and watching Netflix until you literally grow into and merge with your own couches? 

&nbsp;

Hit the fucking books you hideously deformed little bastards. I’m going to go shopping for a Gucci cock ring to match the engravings on my diamond fucking balls. If y’all wanna take this post as financial fucking advice, or advice to do anything other than your own research, then get rekt.

&nbsp;

#Position: 16 shares of GME at $192.63, and not fucking budging no matter how much you whine. I still think this shit’s popping off, and I intend to profit handsomely from it. 

&nbsp;

**TL;DR read some books and eat a bag of dicks.**

P.S. if you manage to stop fondling your limp little mushroom penis long enough, go fucking take a stand for your rights as shareholders.

# Sign the [goddamned shareholder letter]( https://www.stockholdersrights.com/).

What these bastards are doing is criminal, and your grandmother is going to end up in the poorhouse because of them. And you, being the incapable pile of ass that you are, won’t be able to help her unless you fucking take action. Hold them accountable. 

&nbsp;

Honestly, the person/people who got that letter together are maybe the only redeeming humans out of the entire lot of you pathetic chucklefucks. With the exception of rensole and pixel too. 

&nbsp;

And any of you who gild or otherwise award this post deserve the complete and abject black hole of failure that your life will inevitably become. I don’t want your fucking recognition or your karma, I want you to learn to fish for your fucking selves. The only reason I’m on reddit is to shove hot popcorn in my mouth while I watch you all implode over your poor decisions as your mom gives me a luxuriant handie using virgin coconut oil.

**GOOD DAY FELLOW APES —** **LET'S MAKE A MOVIE**

It's been a couple of weeks since I asked you all what you'd like to see in a truthful documentary about what's happening with the squeeze. 

Well. There's certainly interest and we're certainly stoked to get this thing rolling. It's time we introduced ourselves:

[www.apestogetherstrongdoc.com](https://reddit.com/link/mgoo4a/video/ohqqqs2w17q61/player)

You can bet your ass that Netflix, Amazon, Discovery, Disney, and any other multimillion-dollar company is working on their own version of this story. But let's make our own.

**Alright. Who we are/Credentials:**

I consider this a bit of a job interview and in the last post many of you wanted to know why the fuck we're worth your time and trust. 

I am First Assistant Director for [LAIKA studios](https://laika.com/); I run what is the largest and most intense stop motion shooting floor in history. Our latest film [MISSING LINK](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6348138/) won the golden globe for best animated feature.

Here's my [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4533826/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1)

Outside of that, my brother and I do [commercial work](https://www.mulliganbrotherspdx.com) and non-profit work for our hometown of Portland, Oregon. I'm also an award-winning writer:

In summary. I know how to manage gigantic productions, high levels of stress, and know how to tell a story. 

My brother Quinn u/cyclopsQHM is a brilliant musician and all around creative powerhouse. His band [Fanno Creek](https://fannocreekmusic.wordpress.com/) was very successful in Portland and abroad. Their debut album [MONUMENTS](https://sohitekrecords.bandcamp.com/album/monuments) fucking crushes and you should check it out.

His primary focus outside of his [solo work](https://quinnhenrymulligan.com) has been on producing and directing our commercial work with myself with a heavy focus on our post-production sound and music.

**OKAY ENOUGH WITH THE CREDENTIALS**

These issues are extremely important to my brother and me. We don't come from much. Everything we know how to do, we learned ourselves. From lighting a scene to color grading, to dealing with fucking color space and holding a boom we've gotten where we have by just figuring shit out. 

Our family was hit hard by the financial crisis. Our friends, many of whom are artists, can't and won't be able to afford homes in their own city. 

This event has blown the doors off of Wall Street and we need to take control of the narrative. 

A paradigm shift like this is a once-in-a-lifetime moment and I don't want it to pass us by without at least taking a swing at telling this story from the perspective of the little ape. 

We are going to be completely open and honest with all of you every step of the way. This will be our first feature film to spearhead on our own so it will be a journey but one we're both ready for. Especially with all of you behind us and with the incredible team we're going to build — We're one of you.

🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍

We want to hear from all of you. We want to hear from u/rensole u/wardenelite u/heyitspixel and many more.

You can sign up for our mailing list [HERE](https://www.apestogetherstrongdoc.com/) if you'd like to stay in the loop.

We're in the midst of planning our kickstarter/budget/schedule but want to get the word out and the hype UP so when we launch, we aim for the fucking moon.

In case any of you were actually wondering if the price drop in after hours was real, FEAR NOT, it was done with EXTREMELY LOW VOLUMES, so much so that it barely moved the VWAP.

\---------- **BOILERPLATE:**

I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀

**TLDR: The $27 (15%) price drop in after hours only brought the VWAP down by $3 (2%). This clearly shows that the price was lowered with very low volumes and not indicative of the average price the stock has been trading at . 💎✋🚀🚀🚀**

\----------

Note: **VWAP 'resets' each day, therefore you would see it drop from after hours to pre-market but this isn't because of some HUGE increase in volume, it's just set up to see average trends within the day.**

[For those that don't know, here is what Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is all about](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vwap.asp#:~:text=The%20volume%20weighted%20average%20price%20(VWAP)%20is%20a%20trading%20benchmark,and%20value%20of%20a%20security)

Essentially it is  the average price that a stock has been traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. This means that if a price changes with very little volume (comparatively), then it will have little effect on the VWAP.

A great example of how the VWAP shows what a stock is actually trading at, take a look at the VWAP (purple line) from March 10 when there was that huge short attack. As you can see, the VWAP barely registered it since the volumes were quite low at the very low prices.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qymzm5ze9wo61.png?width=1264&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4d3d386394602cf83352cfd552dd88f1bacf0cf

Now let's take a look at today's after hours (colored in blue). You can the VWAP is WAY above the current price line and barely registers the drop in price. This is because the volumes are comparatively so low during AH that it has a minimal effect.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cr4icdh39wo61.png?width=1181&format=png&auto=webp&s=659a20138599dacc1f8fc049c2f02d79d1122507

During after hours, the **price dropped $27 dollars**, but it only dropped the **VWAP $3** and it is still trending up in the **$180s.** Shorts are clearly trying to make it seem like there is disappointment in the earnings call, giving MSM all the ammo they need to write negative articles. Too bad apes can't read.

Ps, If you have a free TradingView account, it is not using direct NYSE data, it is using something called CBOE BZX and your data will not look like mine. You need to have a pro account and pay $2 for the direct NYSE data feed, which I do 😃

[CBOE BZX Data - trading view](https://www.tradingview.com/?solution=43000473924)

Note: Today was a very low volume day \~9million with a very high volume after hours >2 million and it STILL didn't bring down the VWAP very much.

What We Saw This Week...,1616375833.0,"Morning Apes! My main stomping ground over on WSBN is still getting bot-bombed at the moment, so I hope you don't mind me sliding in here for a quick post. You'll have to put up with me posting it myself today, instead of it getting copy/pasted, for a change.

-**Part 1: The Shorts**-

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME

We are currently in a complete market disconnect when dealing with GME short shares.

In this graph, you will see the correlation between the red ""FEE"" line, and the blue bars showing the ""AVAILABLE"" shares to borrow. 

https://i.imgur.com/tNF8w8t.png

As the bars get smaller, the line gets higher. As the shares get harder to borrow, the fee increases. Simple business acumen.

By why isn't it actually doing that the last few weeks?

I monitor the shorts on various platforms constantly, and on Friday, we saw available to borrow shares on IBD fluctuate in the hundreds for the first time since we pulled-back to $40.

Let me say that again: **Between 2pm and 4pm on Friday 19Mar21, there were less than 1,000 shares available to borrow to short on IBD.**

Maximum shares to borrow has not increased on IBD since 3/17/21. On 3/17 there was a total available share count of 600,000. Normally as shares get lent out, the numbers gradually replenish themselves as shares are covered and new shares are located to borrow. 

https://i.imgur.com/bpLQ6MD.png

For example on 3/15, the day began with 250,000 available. It dropped to 100,000 at 12:45, before being replenished at 1:30pm back up to 250,000. They ended the day with 150,000 available, and the next day on 3/16, they had replenished to 400,000.

https://i.imgur.com/VlYnbIh.png

Well, 10:00am on 3/17/21 was the last time any shares have been replenished on IBD. The available to borrow share count has **ONLY** gone down since that time, and there has been **ZERO** meaningful replenishment. 

They couldn't even find 1,000 actual shares to borrow on Friday.

https://i.imgur.com/rUYtFnF.png

But if shares are so hard to locate right now... why hasn't the borrow fee increased?

That isn't even a rhetorical question... I'm legit asking anyone out there: How does the price to borrow DECREASE on a day when shares aren't able to be found, and after two steady days of not being able to locate new shares to lend?

Who thinks that is a good bet? Who lends such a highly volatile stock as GME, with no shares available to locate, at 0.5%? 

Someone is purposely trying to make shorting GME a cheap bet. I think someone just wants to watch the world burn, and they are selling gasoline at 0.5%...

Part 1b:

https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme

And how does IBD only show borrowable shares in the thousands, but Fintel shows the daily short numbers at 6,400,000 shares shorted for a total of 26% of the total daily trading volume?

Yes, I realize that IBD only shows a couple of brokers, that it's updated every 15 minutes, and doesn't show cumulative count... but there's a big fucking difference in the information we're being given by these two entities. IBD shows that a broker hasn't replenished any shares in 3 days, while Fintel is showing 6,400,000 shorted shares in a single day.

Where the hell are these shares being borrowed from? Or are they just being created by a market maker to sell themselves? I'm leaning toward a Bona Fide Market Maker is creating these shorts for themselves, without having to go to market to locate the borrow. I'm going to make a separate post about this later...

-**Part 2: The Fundamentals**-

Why does the market even care what we value GameStop at? Again, this isn't a rhetorical question. I'm legit curious why anyone cares if we think GameStop is worth $0 or $1,000,000 per share. The entire premise of a free and fair market is that a buyer and seller set the price. Anything else is irrelevant.

But, is it really irrelevant?

At $200 per share, GameStop has a $14bil market cap.

That's less than 3x revenue, based on previous sales... and sales are about to boom.

Every single dollar over their previous revenue that they earn on this upcoming report, is just a higher valuation for the stock to naturally sit at. There is a reason we haven't seen the price go too far under $200... and that's because the company is worth $200 a share. Not squoze, not propped-up by short hedgies buying shares... it's worth $200 per share. Based on fundamentals alone.

Stocks tend to be forward-looking by 6-18 months. I think this earnings report is going to paint a really bright picture for the 18 month future of GameStop.

Everyone keeps saying how brick and mortar is dead, but every GameStop location is currently profitable. It isn't about rotating out of brick and mortar into online-only... their physical locations are already generating money and brand recognition. It's just about revenue expansion, cost-cutting, and streamlining...

In my original DD back when GME was at $100, I told you how I felt that this quarters earnings are going to SMOKE expectations. I haven't changed my stance.

For instance, just think about the tailwind of Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon this year. Just wait until you hear what the trading card sales have done for their bottom line on the earnings call this week.

Ryan, if you're reading this and you guys don't have anything in your presentation planned to touch on the expansion of your footprint in the trading card sector... this is your wake-up call. Put that in there. It's going to turn into a huge revenue stream for you if you treat it correctly. You need to get your ass on the phone with Papa Hasbro/Nintendo and set up a direct distribution model to turn GameStops into mini Pokemarts and MTG centers for people to buy product at. And start selling booster boxes for fucks sake.

GameStop has revenue streams that they haven't even begun to tap into yet. Management has shit the bed for years and failed to innovate. The potential in GameStop is massive, it just wasn't being utilized. The brand recognition and multi-national footprint alone is valuable.

Look at it this way:

NKLA is a fucking scam, claims to have around 300 employees, produced $95,000 in annual revenue, and it has a market cap of $6bil. 

GameStop has 5,500 physical locations, employs over 50,000 people, produced $5,000,000,000 in annual revenue, and has a current market cap of $14bil.

And the market has the balls to tell *US* what a good investment is?... Fuck off Cramer. Zero chance in hell that any analyst would debate me in real time and unscripted on the fundamentals of GameStop.

The old market is just pissed off that they missed out on something... just like they've been pissed off at Tesla for years. They'll do and say anything to protect their ego. It's not even just about money at this point. They have to prove they were right. GameStop will be sitting at $1200, and they'll be telling us how it's heading for $12.

-**Part 3: The Volume**-

Go check any of your favorite boomer stocks and look at the volume on Friday. I'll bet that most of them have a higher than normal volume showing on Friday due to witching day.

- Coke: 15-20m average... 63.5mil on Friday
- McD's: 3-4mil average... 7.5mil on Friday
- JNJ: 5-10mil on average... 15mil on Friday
- PG: 6-10mil on average... 20mil on Friday
- Petco: 1-5mil on average... 10mil on Friday
- GameStop: 50mil on average... 24mil on Friday (fuckery)

Wait. What?..

Now yes, I do realize that there are going to be some outlying companies that don't see an increase in trading volume on a quad witching day... 

But GameStop's volume trended *negatively* for the day. And not just negative, but almost half of it's 50day and 200day daily volume averages. On a quad witching day when ETFs were rebalancing?..

So. You're telling me that on the one day that shorts were impossible to locate to borrow, that trading volume just happened to be half of its average... on the highest trading volume day of the year. Alrighty then.

-**Part 4: The Options**-

~10,500. 

That's how many calls finished in the money for the 19Mar21 contracts at $200 on Friday. That's 1,050,000 shares that need to be delivered by Tuesday. That's 1.5% of the total actual float.

I've already explained to everyone how I believe two hedgies (or one hedgie with two accounts) are trading the same bundle of shares back and forth with each other to artificially inflate volume.

Trading 1,000,000 shares for a $00.0001 spread on an off-exchange pool costs $100 per 1,000,000 volume. I honestly believe that the daily short volume is closer to 75% of the actual daily open market activity, and that the remaining volume is a single hedgie (or two) trading the same shares to themselves at the 4th decimal point on an off-exchange to spoof volume and cover up the true short percentages.

We should see early this week how an extra 1,000,000 actual shares effects the price. Could be interesting. 

Someone was trying hard to keep it under $200... it took 1,250,000 in volume in under a minute to keep the price over $200 to close at the bell. 1,250,000 shares in under a minute, and the price went straight sideways. 

Those were ~1,000,000 shorts hitting the bid side but not being able to drop the price. No one sold 1,000,000 shares in the last 60 seconds when they have all of after hours to see where the price goes. Those were all shorts attacking the price before the bell.

Now, there were less than 400,000 shares up for delivery at $200. If the daily volume is truly as high as it's being shown to be... 400,000 shares shouldn't even make a blip on the daily chart... so why would someone fight so hard at the close to stop 400,000 shares?... Unless the actual volume is much lower...

-**Conclusion: Have A Good Sunday!**

Rest up apes. Our battle continues.

**Edit:**

The day the Robinhood threads were circulating was 3/17/21. The day that shorts stopped being able to be located to borrow on IBD was 3/17/21. The day people started transferring out of RH and setting their accounts to strictly cash was 3/17/21...

Hmmmmmmmmm....

# This is not the squeeze

So after market close I've seen a lot of people saying \*OMG ITS HERE\*

Dudes chill, this isn't even a mini squeeze, we are talking about a squeeze when it hits above 10k and then it depends on where people want to get out. I know my bottom price has changed over time to be at around a 100k minimum, hell maybe even more.

As was prophesized by Domo and RC himself, they said that GME would naturally find a way to 1000 usd per share. what happened yesterday was nothing more than the market reacting to the news that RC is now officially heading the ""digital evolution"" of GameStop.

it was not a squeeze, just a market reaction.

Just like last time the price can go up rapidly by people fomo'ing in etc.

# Automod

we know there are some issues with automod right now, making it so that new people can't create threads, we are currently looking into it and looking into making the current post time requirement (3 months) to be less.

We are aware of the issues and trying to fix this, please give us some time to do so.

as we do have to walk a fine line between letting new members in and let everyone post but also keep all the bots and shills out.

(protip: messaging me or the other mods threatening us really doesn't help you or us).

&#x200B;

Automod should now allow everyone to post with an account with a minimum age of 30 days.

This is so that the new people can still post, but it keeps most of the bot's and shills out.

Hope this all works now!

# Media Blackout.

As some more astute apes have seen yesterday.... no news on GME?

ok that's weird, they've been saying GmE B@d for weeks now, now its in the green... \*Crickets\*

What makes this more funny is that Jimmy Cramer has gone full blackout, this dude was having multiple tantrums on twitter per day and bitching about GME on ""mad money"" the entire time.

But now it seems that Jim Cramer's show ""mod money"" wont be on this week, and his twitter has gone black, this in combination with nobody else reporting on the entire thing makes me believe we may be facing a media blackout, this in order to make sure that not more people buy in.

&#x200B;

Word of mouth is one of the most valuable things right now.

yesterdays news, nothing on GME?

Yes.

it all depends on a few factors.

1. the shorts need to cover at some point
2. if you're the only ones left with the stocks you set your price.
3. but it isn't.... stfu retard it's possible look at the picture, it's possible, it wont be within 1 day, but it's possible none the less.
4. But if you look at xxx stock, no this is a very special and specific situation, this will never happen again and this is a once in a lifetime shot.
5. should I buy at X price, I'm not going to say when you should buy, but the best time was yesterday, but if you missed that if you want in now is the best moment.

A: no they can't, it's costing them a lot of money being this short every day, it's costing us nothing as we've already paid for our stocks and we own them.

&#x200B;

Q: Retailers have no power on wall street

A: Then why did they try so hard to stop us multiple times? if I were faced in a fight with someone I couldn't beat, I wouldn't try to stop them I'd try everything I could to get them to fold before I got the first punch.

&#x200B;

Q: It will never reach XXX$

A: yeah they told us 400 was impossible, they said it would go into the high thousands if they didn't stop it, this is a waiting game. be patient and you will win.

# Now is the time to gain control of your emotions.

Seriously I get it 200 is an awesome number, less then 2 weeks ago we where at 40, but if your goal is 100.000 K then 200 a share is nothing.

Adjust your expectations and adjust your way of looking at big numbers, because if you hold like a lot of people said, then it will take some days before it gets to 100k , and if you don't adjust your baseline then you will fold early.

10.000 sounds like a lot right? but if I told you you could get a salary of 100.000k its nothing.

100.000 sounds like a lot, but compared to 500.000 its a lowball offer.

ITS OK TO BE GREEDY! but be patient.

Trust the other apes, they have held for a long time (over a month) and they didn't fold.

So trust them now when you are winning.

# New Shill tactic

Ok so I noticed something in the comments today, people asking weird shit like this on mass

    Ok can someone please explain how we dont care if the market crashes? 
    And even if mathematically 500k per share are likely, where will this insane 
    amount of money come from? 
    There is no way the hedgies have this much money. 
    If this flaw in the system causes a crash, who will pay us?

&#x200B;

let me be very simple about this, if you sell a share the broker and clearinghouses pay you.

NOT the HF.

This in itself will not cause a crash of the markets, to crash a market a lot of things need to go wrong, not just one stock shooting up.

How is the 500k per share able to exist? no clue how is Berkshire Hathaway able to be 350k?

it is unknown how high this will go, if you dont understand this do your own DD and **RESEARCH**.

He knows his shit better than 99,9% of us apes that’s for sure.

First, he never really said 100k was impossible, that’s just some people twisting his words. I feel that he realizes the position he is in and he simply does not want to commit on a possible price, and I agree that it’s not a good idea for him to give one. 
 
Here’s how I see it. Warden’s way of predicting price is by analysing charts and using patterns to try to guess what is going to happen next with the price. He focuses on hard data and facts, and there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that, it’s pretty much all that one can do. But GME is not a normal stock. We all know know it’s acting in an UNPREDICTABLE way and it’s a situation that’s never happened before. Using his method, I doubt very much Warden would of been able to predict the huge sudden bump at the end of January, or the following dip back to 40, because this stock is not behaving in a natural way and it’s influenced heavily by external factors. At any time, Long whales, Shorting HFs, MMs or any catalyst can completely fuck up the “natural” flow of the stock.

What Warden does is use the CURRENT AVAILABLE DATA and try to figure the most likely thing to happen next. So right now, with the stock at 190$ and the current trend it’s following, it’s hard/impossible and useless to try to predict the ceiling price. This is why he said that people that predict 1, 2, and 20 million price target are pulling these numbers out of their ass, and it’s true. It does not mean it’s impossible, (it certainly is possible if everyone holds) but we DID pull these numbers out of our asses, we hope that it becomes true because it theoretically can, but the truth is we have no fucking idea and these prices are based on nothing but pure speculation.

So calling Warden a shill? That’s the dumbest thing I have ever seen on this sub by far. The man literally called the squeeze “infinity squeeze” and said that if he had 100k available to invest right now, he would put it all on GME. If that’s not bullish on GME I don’t know what is. When the squeeze starts and the price starts to go up for real, at that moment he will keep analyzing the situation as it evolves, AT THAT TIME, ask him about possible price ceilings. Because right now, it’s pure speculation.

I'm making this post to address some confusion and misconceptions people might have about my recent stream.

I also want to address the negativity people had towards our guest during the stream, Andrew Mo Money. I think it is rude to throw derogatory comments towards Andrew, especially when he is part of the GME community. Guys, ape no fight ape. We need to cut out the negativity and I will pause future streams until we can accept that there is no room for divisive behavior.

I watch Andrew Mo Money myself and I find it valuable that Andrew has catalogued so much DD on his channel. It's really hard to find old DD on Reddit, especially when posts get buried.

Now let's get straight to the point and address some of the misconceptions people had :D

Some comments from u/FearValue:

>I mean,,,, the dude sounded legit last monday.. now its shill this shill that... 10k ceiling. we wont hit 100k.. wtf is that fud all about....

You can watch my video and see that my opinion is, I don't know how high it will go. If apes hold until after the peak, the price can go to 1 million a share. Plain and simple. Please don't spread misinformation saying I said 10k is the ceiling. I never said that.

&#x200B;

>He spews some bleep TA saying “GME could move in Option A, B, or C” which is usually like up, down, or sideways. Then when it inevitably moves up, down, or sideways, he says “so it appears we went with option X”  
>  
>I certainly don’t know more than him, but let’s put things into perspective and remember that he’s a second or third year undergraduate kid with limited market experience. Most of his “predictions” haven’t even been correct, and it is obvious in his posts and livestreams that he is just becoming a sell out looking for clout.

If you followed my earlier posts where I was more active with predictions, the majority of them were accurate. My later posts were meant to have you the audience understand the possible paths I see, so you can make your own predictions. I eased my predictions a lot in my recent posts.

&#x200B;

>he is still going off of a finra report saying si could be faked and down at 20% when GME HAS JUST STATED over 100% is shorted.. SUUUUUUUUS

I said it's hard to say how accurate FINRA SI is. Furthermore I never actually said what the real SI is. This is simply because there is no trustworthy data source that can provide me with a definitive answer. I will simply say that I believe the SI is high.

&#x200B;

>not because a college kid fuds me in and out after just appearing all of a sudden

Everything I said in stream is supported by evidence. If there was a burning house, one person was telling you it's an illusion, and another person told you your house is on fire, who will you listen to?

And please don't spread misinformation to support your confirmation bias. It's not right. Support your investment decisions with proper due diligence and correct facts. If you watch my video, I make it clear how OBV doesn't support GME.

I am now open to further criticism and questions! It is my goal to clear up misunderstandings and to address the concerns of this community.

This is incorrect.

Market makers continuously hedge the contracts that they sell. In the case of (naked) calls, if the share price rises and becomes increasingly likely to hit the strike price of the calls, MMs will buy shares to hedge.

This is how a gamma squeeze works. if the price of a stock rises really fast, it makes out of the money call options in the money, forcing market makers to buy shares to hedge. This forced buying in turn increases the share price even further, making even more calls ITM, and the cycle continues.

Closing above $200 today does nothing since the $200 calls have been ITM for weeks. The shares that are meant to be delivered next week to the call holders have already been bought.

The only thing that closing above $200 did, is making a tonne of puts (roughly 450,000 of them) worthless, this hurts bears (fuck em).

WE ARE BEING PRICE-SUPPRESSED! \*\*\*

ONE whale wallet is almost singlehandedly keeping $DOGE down by dumping 1 million $DOGE every 15 minutes, and slowly walking down his limit sell price:

[https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/DG2mPCnCPXzbwiqKpE1husv3FA9s5t1WMt](https://bitinfocharts.com/dogecoin/address/DG2mPCnCPXzbwiqKpE1husv3FA9s5t1WMt)

He's been doing it since April 16th, and at his current rate, it will take him \~118 hours (or 5 days) to liquidate. His sell limit is $0.324, meaning the highest price for this asset will hover at this price, or whatever he changes his sell limit to, for at least the next 5 days when he runs out of money, or until he stops selling.

Assuming it's not a a sell-bot, if he ever leaves his terminal, that's when the rocket leaves the pad, until he starts selling again. If this is automated, it should last at least 5 days and could walk the price down into the 20 cent range.

It's pretty obvious this guy is trying to provoke a mass panic-sell, so don't allow yourself to be psychologically manipulated by this tactic, it's as old as the market.

SPREAD THE WORD.

We can buy the dips and hold longer than he can continue to sell.

$DOGE has a market cap of $50 billion with 130 billion coins in circulation.

$ETH has a market cap of $250 billion with 115 million coins in circulation.

$DOGE is more popular than $ETH by far. When $DOGE attains the same market cap as $ETH, IT WILL BE WORTH \~$2 PER COIN!

As far as the ""inflationary"" FUD goes, ALL COMMON CURRENCIES HAVE TO BE INFLATIONARY, like the dollar, to account for lost currency, only stores of value like Bitcoin and gold have a finite supply. $DOGE has 130 billion coins in circulation with a constant 5 billion or less added each year. This small 4% inflation rate this year matches the dollar, and predictably decreases over time as the number of Dogecoins in circulation increases, just like the US Dollar.

$DOGE being ""inflationary"" is good, not bad, and qualified it uniquely to be the global electronic currency.

Good luck to all.

(Note: While I usually apply a paranoid mindset to manipulation like this, it could be a whale trying to walk the price down low enough for some cronies to have a good entry point, or thinking altruistically, perhaps even to allow retail investors who were shut out, to have a good entry point. But nah, he's probably just a greedy bastard who resents the success of Doge because other coins supposedly have ""better fundamentals"", and Doge is taking a hammer to their price graphs over the past week.)

EDIT: I found out why this is being done, it's not altruistic and is manipulation. It's some foreign billionaire using what is likely a Chinese Binance wallet (according to a very computer literate friend of mine) to fuck with us. I've only found one whale wallet doing this, but it may be a group of several like-minded foreign billionaires trying to hurt the American middle class because our love for Doge has caused their favorite coins to go down a lot in the last 5 days or so. Read this thread where it appears to be more than one very wealthy foreign white supremacist person coordinating this:  [/biz/ - I am FUCKING LOVING the slow bleed. Reddit - Business & Finance - 4chan (4channel.org)](https://boards.4channel.org/biz/thread/33586690)  DO NOT FALL FOR THE MANIPULATION, he/they can't seem to take it below 30 cents with all the buy pressure, even with this well-coordinated ladder attack, and he/they will run out of money eventually. Finally, create awareness and SPREAD THE WORD to keep him/them from winning.

Also, thank you for the upvotes and support!

\*\*\* IMPORTANT EDIT 4/22/2021 \*\*\*  The whale bought 339 million Dogecoin here:  ([Imgur](https://imgur.com/a/w1xhK48)). He's selling the peaks to drive the price down, and buying the artificial depression in price he (or they) created. Meanwhile everyone else suffers and panic sells, losing their money, essentially to HIM (or them). Very dirty pool.

The Final Whale.,1616161986.0,"**This will get downvoted by the shills** but I thought it was worth repeating for anyone else that needed to hear this, because I've had this internal debate as well. Just how important are we?

&#x200B;

Looking at the recent DD posted about how much retail owns, I realized that in all of this, we are the unknown. All the hedge funds know what they will do. All the other big players have probably mapped each others moves. The problem is the retail whale. We have enough of the float that we decide how high this goes. The only thing we don't get to decide is the catalyst.

I've always had a thought that what if this is just whales battling, and we're the small guy, even though the math didn't make sense. Once I saw the calculations it was enough for me. We are the key part of this squeeze. We are completely distributed and we are the people, so you can't blame us the way you can blame a single hedge fund, we have that layer of liability protections. We can't be negotiated with because our smooth brains are incapable of even the most basic level of coordination. It's a miracle we were able to understand buy and hold. We have no brain cells left for anything else. Anyone else know what an exit strategy is?

The only aspect we are relatively powerless is the catalyst. Even then we have things like the earnings report so not completely powerless. Not to mention the constant buying pressure we apply means they can't ever unravel the coil. We've seen how pitiful their attempts to manipulate us are. So 100k, 500k, 1 mill. We decide it. NOT the whales. They can paper hand at 10k and it won't matter, we have enough of the float that it won't matter. We are the whale. As long as this is true, they wouldn't paper hand either, because they would just watch us earn the money. So they can be the catalyst but we decide the ceiling. Whether we want cash, jail time for the crooks or both. We are the most important whale in this entire equation.

&#x200B;

So on this quad witching day, I hope everyone has a wonderful Friday, and I hope everyone remembers that for once in our lives we aren't some puppets being manipulated by billionaires. We are individually gorillas, and we are together the final whale.

I'm all, 100% for the idea of not pushing specific dates as do or die. I think the whole ""3/19 is the day"" thing did a lot of harm to the morale of less informed apes, especially since it should have mentioned as a prelude that a lot of the factors that kicked off yesterday won't start showing visible effects until sometime next week 

*To expand on this before moving on, shares for call options that were exercised 3/19 technically could be delivered as late as eod Tuesday, the ETF rebalancing day was yesterday but as far as I know the actual effects of that will hit next week, etc*

That said, the idea of not pushing any more theories in general is exactly what hedge funds were going for by trying to get our DD guys banned, and it's really easy to see if you put even a few seconds of thought into the process.

First of all, if this place has no more theories, no more DD, no more research, only the handful of those users here that actually know the market inside and out (and let's be honest, that's a minority of users) will ever know when big events are happening. As has been said a long time, *retail is a whale*, and widespread knowledge among the userbase is what leads to upwards pressure at the correct moments. /r/GME isn't a single financial institution or entity that can just throw all of its assets at something in a moments notice without any person knowing what's going on, and things like closing above $200 yesterday have major effects on the squeeze being squoze. GME closed at $200.24 yesterday. Do you think it closes above $200 if there wasn't information all over this place talking about how $200 was an important mark? Sure, a lot of that pressure last minute was from computers and algorithms (hell, most of it probably was), but the general movement throughout the day was shaped by retail and plenty of retail investors made a difference in that last second push. Take away the availability of information and the share price likely closes under $200 - that's no good.

Second is morale. All the bullshitting here is what keeps people engaged. If this sub was nothing but ""HODL"" and nothing to discuss every day, some people would get bored and quit. Sorry to say if you think otherwise, but it's true. Keeping people engaged and interested is major when the investment is spread across so many retail investors, and not discussing anything would be a slow rot that would slowly eat away at this place.

And finally (and this should be **really** obvious)... do you seriously think hedge funds can't see important dates coming? Do you think hedge funds that have major money invested in this, controlling billions of dollars worth of capital, don't know about quadruple witching day? Do you think they've never heard about ETF rebalancing? Do you think they're just sitting there watching GME drain their accounts and they aren't thinking about Gamestop's earnings report, or the possibility of a share recall? *Of course not*. It's genuinely misinformed to think that all of this wasn't circled on their calendar in the first place. The only thing that taking the availability of information away does is make sure they're informed, and the apes aren't.

* Studying research that confirms a certain conviction
* Doing your own research in order to shape a certain conviction
* Learning about management, CEOs, board of directors, and vision of aforementioned
* Learning about market manipulation, dark pools, market makers, and market control
* Learning about the SEC, DTCC, and broader market controllers
* Learning about market sentiment, bullishness/bearishness, and picking a side
* Learning about trading psychology and staying true to what you believe in
* Learning about volume and how volume moves price
* Learning about supply and demand and how something can become invaluable through immense demand
* Learning about short squeezes, short interest, failure to deliver, and shorting in general
* Learning about option chains, calls, puts, and gamma squeezes
* Learning about synthetic/fake shares

Observation literally changes reality you smooth brained APES. 

Do you realise the significance of that sentence?

In quantum physics we call this the **OBSERVER EFFECT.**

“”The act of observing will influence the phenomenon being observed. The **observer effect** is the fact that observing a situation or phenomenon necessarily changes it“”

In ape: just by observing, the observer can change the very thing they are looking at.

Now lets apply this here. Look at (observe) this image all day long, set it as your wallpaper. Get comfortable with seeing GME at this price. Get it engraved into your brain.

$2,000,000 is literally the **FLOOR**.

**Edit 4**: I want to draw attention to u/rensole's comment. Iborrow is not the only source of shares to be borrowed from. MM's have access to plenty of other sources.

**Edit 5**: okay, the question about what does the interest rate mean has come up alot, so I will try to explain it. Full disclaimer, I haven't been able to find or view other borrowers because I just don't have access. What I am saying is based on several other posts I have read over the past week. If someone else can confirm my logic I would greatly appreciate it. Anyway here we go:

The lenders set the fee. It's their shares and that's the interest they charge for lending for every day the share is not returned. 

Generally speaking though, a higher interest rate means the shares are more difficult to procure. If there are less shares available, then the squeeze is much closer. 

So why is Iborrow interest rate so low? Well think about it. HFs know we use Iborrow. If we saw the interest rate increasing there, we'd get more bullish and they don't want that. So they're manipulating IBorrow to make it seem like there is plenty of shares so we don't get all excited by keeping the interest rate down. This can be checked by viewing other lenders going interest rates, like Fidelity, NASDAQ, etc. So what do we do? Buy and Hold. There is more than one source for info. Go find them.

**Edit 6**: okay another question I'm seeing:
If MMs and HFs have a dark pool off the market to execute buy orders and then store up sell orders to tank the market while giving you and IOU how can the price ever go up? 

Good question my smooth brained apes. Allow me to explain. 

It's actually quite simple. Not all brokers operate through MMs and HFs. Majority of them, like Fidelity and Vanguard, execute the orders themselves. If your using Robinhood, or some of the other free to use apps, then yes, this is exactly what is happening. But not everyone uses those. Personally, I use J.P Morgan and Merill Lynch, so my buys and sells are being executed when I do them, not by a hedgefund in a dark pool. So the price goes up. Hope this helps! 

Yes, this does mean you should switch off Robinhood or any other Margin buyers so they can't screw you over when selling time comes.",2021-03-19 19:12:26

Ok seems a bunch of people are doing detective work on my experience and picture. I'll make this easy, mod pm me I will send proof of my identity. who are the mods,** /u/rensole **and who else?**

&#x200B;

More than a decade ago I was once a suit and I recognize from the characteristics of the way some of these DDs are written that they most likely are suits. All of them seem to have different motives but just like we have Suit shills that have infiltrated, long Suits have also infiltrated. I believe some are writing DDs to feed us small bits of info to keep us in the game... However, I've come to strongly believe others are here to turn us against ourselves or help them without realizing it.

Here's a picture of my desk 15 years ago (4 monitors missing from pic) [https://imgur.com/a/D2Qh42J](https://imgur.com/a/D2Qh42J) as a Junior analyst staring at 10 monitors. Traded on CBOE and ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) as a JA with mostly futures. Later moved to Senior trading commodities + swaps, and finally managed a desk at different company that traded all of them. Now a dirty farmer barely making any money but live a wonderful life with my wife and kids.

I have many examples of what made me suspicious but it's the way they use phrases, how they type, and how intricate some of the explanations are that makes me believe they have quant background. One example is how VaR is written, VaR = Value at risk and it's used to calculate risk of a portfolio or your positions. Back in my days executives and management were extremely anal about it being written exactly as ""VaR"" to denote value at risk b/c ""var"" itself has many abbreviations. If I ever presented to my execs about our positions and didn't write it as VaR, my SVP would rip me a new one. If i went to the board without writing it like that, I would lose my job that day. Anyways when a user wrote it as VaR, it gave me flashbacks so I started reading every post he/she would write and it occurred to me that this person has experience with Black Scholes modeling (back then was the gold standard for Pricing Options + Futures). I immediately became suspicious that either this user was once a suit like me or still is one. I started taking notes on all of the DDs written ever since February to guess if they were suits or not. I said nothing about it because I didn't want the suits to stop feeding us info. I'm saying something about it now because I believe we are at the end game and retail has proven ourselves reliable.

So what are some of the nefarious reasons I believe suits are here other than to data mine? Well 2 users in particular (that I believe are suits) that I noticed will hype us up every week that ""something huge is coming this friday!! Look at the options chain someone is setting up for a gamma!!!"" I thought to myself why does the DD from these 2 always get voted up so quickly despite them being wrong almost every week. Then it occurred to me... I think these 2 are pumping up retail so we dump our stocks for FDs which have been free premiums for them week after week and also resets their FTDs. For those that don't know, FDs are weekly options that majority of the time expire worthless which are easy premiums for the option writer. With GME IV (implied volatility) being so high, option premiums have been ridiculously expensive even for weeklies. My guess is short hedge funds are writing these FDs, gaining easy premiums $$, and using the premiums $$ to drag out the fight.

I don't have any proof that this is the case and it's just a hunch of mine. I also don't want to name out these users because I could be wrong about them being a suit or about their motives. I don't know anything anymore ever since I went down this GME rabbit hole. I feel dumber and less knowledgeable the more I learn about how GME is manipulated. I don't even know if my mom is my mom anymore!! Better go get a DNA doctor degree b/c I can't trust liberal doctors to do the testing!! Get the degree myself so I can do the dna testing of my mom myself to prove she is my mom. AHHHH GOING CRAZY!!!

**TLDR: short Hedge Fund Suits have infiltrated and are writing DDs to get you to buy FDs which lines their pockets with money to drag out the fight.**",2021-03-28 04:08:51

The post circulating claiming that hedgies can cover under $40 is bullshit and just trying to spread FUD that we LOSE when they drop it below $40 tomorrow.

1. The original thread does some fucking INSANELY detailed DD, but he doesn’t understand you can’t cover with Puts? Almost as if the guy wrote an insanely long DD post to convince people that he’s smart and to listen to him without critically thinking...

2. RANDOM Accounts are copy and pasting that post everywhere on r/wallstreetbets, r/wallstreetbetsnew, r/gme etc... These accounts then make some happy supporitive replies on any comment that agrees. They avoid any questioning regarding puts not being able to cover shorts. 

3. The timing is just fucking weird. They drop the price around $40, this dude somehow comes up with this insane DD based on data from 3 days ago and drops it today, right before the first day the close is $40.

4. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/ln9d2m/regard_the_last_dd_on_why_40_matters/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

5. The OP of the $40 FUD post, doesn’t once call himself a re tard or reference his favorite flavor of crayon. what the actual fuck.

Let’s be clear. They cannot cover shorts with puts. 

Hopefully, I’m wrong about his intentions and this post helps keep the price above $40. BUT if it drops below $40, then don’t be a little paper handed bitch who believes the lies from that DD. Nothing changes, they still need to cover. Just because it’s a long post and has a lot of numbers doesn’t mean you nod and repeat after him. We are apes, not parrots.

If it looks like a hedgie using sketch tactics to make you scared and sell, if it sounds like a hedgie using sketch tactics to make you scared and sell, it’s probably a hedgie using sketch tactics to make you scared and sell.

Remember what DFV said today... 
“I like the stock”

Quite frankly, I agree with him and will be holding 💎🤲

Customary top TLDR: 1. GME can call a dividend which will either be paid by shorts or cause the price to moon; 2. GME could call a stock split to incentivise mass buying pressure; and 3. RC could negotiate a buy price of the entire GME, which would force **all shorts to close**, giving him the right to buy the company for nothing (or a profit) if he sells his shares and takes the company private after apes get paid.

I've seen a lot said about the shareholder's meeting and it's potential to cause the MOASS, and even general board decisions that can be made. Stock splits? Dividends? Share recall? What does it all even mean!

I'll wrap this all up as a theoretical tactic we could see at the end, but first, I'll explain what each of these are.

As always, this is not financial advice nor legal advice and this is out of my wheelhouse, so I invite you to correct me where I'm wrong, as we help build the collective knowledge.

*It's important to note firstly, GME does NOT like shorties either, and these actions could be a part of the reason why they included that tasty little shorts warning in their 10k...*

**Onto the DD - let's start with dividends shall we?**

What is dividen? 

Well essentially a dividend is a payment out of the company to its shareholders either via the company's profits or retained cash.

It has 4 stages;

1. Announcement date (self explanatory);

2. Ex-dividend date (the set date after announcement, where if you buy stock after this date, you aren't entitled to the dividend);

3. Record date (the cut off date for determining who's long and short, and what will be paid to whom); and

4. Payment date (self explanatory).

But GME barely retained enough cash for its purposes right? Why would it issue a dividend??

Well it's not even about that. It's about the acknowledgement GME is over 100% shorted in their 10k, which makes this interesting.

Why? Well stealing straight from Investopedia:

*If an investor is short a stock on the record date, they are not entitled to the dividend.*

**In fact, the (short) investor is instead responsible for paying the dividend owed to the lender of the shorted stock that they borrowed.**

So GME declares say, I don't know $5 a share dividend on its 70m shares to pay out around $350m.

But management decides they'll throw that straight back into the company so they'll only pay out $5 x 56m shares so that's $280m, easily doable.

But, if the stock is over 100% short, who pays that and the shares over 100% dividend out? 

You guessed it. The shorties.

So if it's 200% over the float? That's $560m, 900% over the float? $2.5 billion with a damn B the collective shorts will pay out.

Even more delicious? Retail gets $5 a share, this will become important later, even if it may seem insignificant now.

Hilariously this would give DFV a cool $250k for nothing. Anyway.

CORRECTION: DFV would take $500k as he doubled down, of course

**There is literally no downside for the board of GME to do this if they know they're over 100% shorted, either the shorts pay the entire dividend which the board likely reinvests into itself and so does retail or worst case scenario, it pays out $280m, which as we know the majority of the apes would throw straight back in.**

**What's better? If the shorties can't / won't pay it, they have to buy back the stock! Which would raise the share price and GME's institutions gain waaay more than the dividend from share price hike**

**Better than that? The stripping of cash from shorts if the float is shorted something ridiculous like 300%+ could cause the shorts to get margin called, affect members of the NSCC'S Clearing Fund and SLD payments and cause them to get their ass liquidated too, and GME can declare this whenever they damn feel like it!**

Edit: it has been pointed out GME are indentured to not issue a dividend. My counterargument? To breach an indenture is to pay back the bond / loan which provided this restrictive covenant, which GME should be more than prised to do given their current capital and alleviate this debt

**Let me be clear, I do not condone breaching indentures, this should be renegotiated or paid off to protect fiduciary duty**

**PLEASE READ: Yes GME has a contract not to issue a dividend, but this is tied money being lent to them when they were in a worse financial position and which could be paid off now if they so choose given their healthier financial position if they chose to either breach this condition or just make payment of the debt in full, clearing them of this restriction. I'd recommend they do the latter for the avoidance of doubt.**

**I still think therefore this remains possible if not plausible, as the public aim for the company is to reduce debt and one that comes with strings attached is all the more important to get rid of first**

**GME could do this by a minor share issuance to raise sufficient capital beyond what their current cash position may be**

*But wait! There's more…*

Are ya still with me apes?

**Onto stock split**

So the board has essentially implemented a free money glitch for themselves and their investors, everyone's happy right? (Maybe not the shorties)

So the shorties left, which didn't hear no bell, double and triple down again and again as they have been doing.

They get that FUD machine whirring and pay for stories on MSM like ""Struggling GME bizarrely issues dividend after disappointing year end"" or some other such bullshit, full well knowing the shorties just paid for the dividend and increased their revenue and/ or stock price for those who had to buy back to avoid paying it.

Well apes now have a little bit of extra money paid into their **broker account**, but it ain't enough to buy a share for some or most. I mean I know most of you apes would just buy a fraction of one, but how could you incentivise more buying?

**Order a stock split**

A stock split is where a company increases the number of its shares by a ratio, so for instance a 1:10 stock split for GME would increase the available shares to 700m. Any apes who held 1 share now holds 10, 10 shares? 100.

You get the idea. The current stock price is then divided by the number used to split.

**As @PPL did, they can even choose to provide investors before the split some additional shares too, like 1:10+4 making the short problem even worse, as if you hold 1 share you'd now have 14**

So GME @$200 becomes $20 instead. **Nothing actually changes, the shorts have a 10x increase in their short position and so do the longs**

**Therefore every $1 price movement equates to $10 for the shorts, as all their existing positions are amplified in the same manner**

But now? I have say $20+ dollars sitting in my account from the dividend and the price of the stock just became $20, so yes please I'll take another.

The price then become FAR more attractive to those on the sidelines, like those on the fence saying fuck it I'll take 5 etc etc and suddenly the already overwhelming buy pressure from the dividend and those on the sidelines ramps up significantly.

If this triggers the MOASS, then 50k a share for those who held before the split is actually 500k a share, 200k a share is 2m a share, it just appears a factor of 10 smaller. 

Remember, the shorties positions remain; they've just increased, and the number actually needed to be bought back is significantly higher.

But to combat this, the shorties create a literally never seen before number of naked shorts to try and suppress the price resulting in a record FTD train, o noes what now?

**Cohen buys GameStop**

The final nail in the coffin on my theory if they are used in conjunction with one another. It's why I call it the Cohen Killshot.

In order for RC to ""buy"" GameStop outright, he needs 50% of the shares.

Now we know he currently owns 12.9% of the shares with the option to bump this up to ~20%. All he needs to do now is agree a price with the **new** board of directors for that final 30% and take total control.

If Ryan Cohen or RC Ventures negotiates with GameStop for their purchase and a price is agreed, guess what?

**Checkmate motherfucker.**

If this happens, and by all intents and purposes this was RC's goal from the beginning, all lent shares **will have to be recalled**.

Every. Single. One.

Know what that means? Forced buy in of what we assume to be astronomical short positions, whether they be real or FTD.

This will send the price to the moon and do you know what's the icing on the cake for RC?

He can sell his 20% when this thing moons and not only pay *nothing* to acquire a billion dollar company, he'll actually **make money whilst simultaneously acquiring the whole damn thing and taking it private**

Meanwhile we apes sit back and watch the board go to work, and sell when our price is right.

Now don't get me wrong, any of the above in isolation could result in shorts r fuk, but if I were a tactician lawyer, like RC's (check the damn résumé of Christopher P. Davis); this is exactly what I'd do.

So let's recap, GME could issue a dividend paid by the shorts and all those holding naked or synthetic short positions. This bleeds them of capital putting them in hot water, apes collect this dividend and the price of GME becomes too irresistible following a split and many throw their entire dividend into the stock, and new apes join the case, causing the price to rocket. 

Finally, even if the most ridiculous FTD naked positions are made, if RC buys GameStop they're forced to close causing the MOASS, although all could individually. RC then pays nothing and profits by purchasing a billion dollar company, takes it private, turns it into the chewy of gaming and IPOs again for MASSIVE profit, after apes have made some serious $$$.

Let's hope we see some juicy press releases going forwards apes, the end is nigh for shorties.

EDIT: holy crap apes the discussion on this has been great, thank you to every response both in support and against, it's important we challenge each other.

I make it a point of at least reading, if not replying to every comment but there's just so many I can't keep up before I need to sleep, I'll try and get round to you all tomorrow!

Edit 2: I need to make a few things clear here, **first this is a theory, not inevitable** dang apes I'm outlining possibilities GME could take

**Second** yes GME has a contract not to issue a dividend, but to breach this or be freed from this obligation, they could choose to pay off the debt, breach it and pay off the debt in accordance with the contract, or renegotiate this term if they so wished, all of this is within the realm of possibility as negotiations of this type happen all the time

**Third** yes RC has a contract not to buy more shares but again, this is an agreement with the *old board*, when the new board is put in place this too could be renegotiated, not everything agreed in a contract is set in stone, and contracts are breached and/ or renegotiated all the time, I think it's plausible RC renegotiates this deal when he helps install a majority on the board

**Taking over a company requires stepping on toes. The corporate world is a minefield of actions to achieve your aim, my point is you don't employ someone of RC's lawyers experience if you don't plan on shaking things up to reach your goal and he's assisted in his clients becoming a major shareholder and taking over companies. Hell, we don't even know if some of the previous board were introduced by shorts to help run the business down, this is how things work**",2021-03-28 19:38:42

Let's look at some real numbers in the 13F/13D/13G filings.

There's a SEC rule that says if an institution holder's ownership increases/decreases by 5% or more of a company's total stock issue then they're required to report the buy/sell within 10 days of any month-end.  
[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/schedule13g.asp)

Interesting.. let's look at the institutions that hold more than 5%.(I'm not including RC VENTURES LLC & HESTIA CAPITAL PARTNERS LP as their shares are locked up)  
[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/gme](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/gme)

1. FMR LLC (Fidelity) - 9,276,000 Shares

(Reported as sold on Whale Wisdom but actually were transferred)

2. BLACKROCK INC. - 9,217,335 Shares

3. VANGUARD GROUP INC - 5,162,095 Shares

4. SENVEST MANAGEMENT, LLC - 5,050,915 Shares

5. MAVERICK CAPITAL LTD - 4,658,607 Shares

6. MORGAN STANLEY - 4,275,838 Shares

7. DIMENSIONAL FUND ADVISORS LP - 3,934,919 Shares

**Total Shares Held:** 41,575,709 Shares

**Float:** 45,160,000 Shares

Lets do some simple math - Total Shares Held/Float = 92%

Institutions that hold 5% or more hold 92% of the float! And they are required to report if they sold 5% or more of their position within 10 days of any month-end. **There has been no reporting!**

It's possible that they sold 4.9999% of their position to help the shorts and avoid reporting, but some of these institutions have been holding since 2002. Plus many have increased their position last year. Why would they suddenly flip and help the shorts? I believe they would've continued buying and holding as they've always done for years.

**OK, 100% minus 92% leaves only 8% or 3,584,291 of the remaining float of real shares!** (For minimum speculation I’m excluding all other institutions that hold less than 5%)

Using this fantastic DD from u/InForTheSqueeze a conservative estimate of retail holdings is 30,854,540.  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd\_i\_did\_the\_math\_there\_is\_literally\_no\_doubt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m7x2gq/dd_i_did_the_math_there_is_literally_no_doubt/)

If we minus the remaining float of 8% or 3,584,291 from the estimate of 30,854,540 we have 27,270,249 shares.

**27,270,249 shares exceed the float and are held by retail!** This is only possible through shorting.

If we take these 27,270,249 shares and divide by the float we get 60%. **At minimum GME is shorted 60% and they need to buy our shares!**

NOW this is a conservative estimate of retail holdings and does not include institutions holding under 5%. It does not include any whales that have been buying either. **This is the BARE BONES Minimum!**

If we use the next conservative estimate of 61,709,080 shares held by retail and do the same math as above we get **128% shorted!**

Hello friends. I will cut to the chase. This website https://apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/temp
... is well the Federal Reserve bank of New York. In this link that I hope you click on I want you to click Export Excel near the top rightish page of the PC. I saw a video on YouTube by Charlie and the vids, very underrated channel give him a follow. The youtuber explains what I am trying to explain to you. The bubble is real. There is something odd on the excel sheet and something that you can see by just clicking the first link that is to the NY Fed Reserve site. About $394 billion dollars have been added to the NY Fed Reserve. And Charlie, the youtuber explained that when cash was injected to save the market from collapsing the FEDS had to give wall street about close to $50 billion dollars to survive. https://www.thebalance.com/2008-financial-crisis-timeline-3305540 Link is there to prove it look at number 3. It will explain that the governments problem was not just liquidity, but also Solvency.

Money that bailed them out fucked us over big time. And now we are at a point where today 05/24/2021 it is at about $394 Billion. Look check out his channel watch how he explains it then come back....

Ok you watched the video now let me explain my own two cents on why I am shitting my pants and you all should be both jacked to the tits and why I am scared for family and friends that didn't listen. Yes, yes I know their fault for not listening to us APES etc... but here is the thing if you current look at the excel sheet or the youtube video look at the day off 05/11/2021. The money is labeled on N as you were told by the awesome youtuber and fellow ape Charlie. The amount there was about $181 Billion dollars. FFW (Fast forward) to today. It is $394 billion dollars. Please if I am wrong correct me we should all be jacked to the tits, but now with the present data that has ben posted by out sweet foolish govt. we need to actually ask them... WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK. Are you guys REALLY willing to throw EVERYONES futures away like this. Apes I can no longer trust anyone in government for my best interests. The stock market was just the start, but now looking that they miss use funds and the SEC jacks off more than doing their jobs. Not to mention https://www.barrons.com/articles/goldman-sachs-bank-america-jpmorgan-bonds-dividends-51618602441 Literally banks selling off bonds to have more liquidity (meaning the need to have cash to cover what they have been borrowing with is more than likely way more than what they sold.) There is also the fact that Dr. Burry (From the movie The Big Short and I am talking about the real one not Christian Bale) has been warning that the market is going to go belly up soon. Basically it has gotten to the point where now he does not have a twitter but he has this https://twitter.com/BurryArchive/status/1366950425874808838/photo/1 This is basically people worried about Dr. Burry being taken out because he is starting to have his predictions become true. Tesla was not going to be wiped out, but he still put a smart Put options on it. He also claims that for sure this is getting out of hand. There is too many loaned stuff out there, not enough cash for all these loans. It also does not help that people are buying homes at higher the regular asking price.

I am not trying to spread FUD. I am trying to do the same thing Dr. Burry has been doing for years. He warned others about the 08 crash and hes warning us now. Has he been known to be early, yes. This does not matter right now because he has been singing a market crash since about 2017... IT has been 4 years and things are finally going to get hard. I contacted my in-laws, my grandparents, friends, and my coaches that will listen. I have also printed out DD and their links to explain what this all means. I am trying to ask and let you all know let your family know one last time because now regardless of AMC GME NOK SNDL NAKD ETC we are now for sure in the end game. I can more more DD if needed, but this time the facts, numbers, and even big man Lou have saidOtoooooo all we do now is hold!

And that is basically it, thank you for reading this long and please be easy on me I do not want FUD we are GREEN APES we just HODL together as a family and get ready for the squeeze and DO NOT sell anything because technically this floor can be as high as we want and believe me even the cool crazy uncle Lou said that people on wall street would kill to have the kind of experience we have diamond handing these shares ETC. :) LOVE YOU ALL!

# Elliot Wave Theory

[Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below...](https://preview.redd.it/ckvxxf66men61.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f838585bedafa3b10e01afd0ad5799a9e33f85e)

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

&#x200B;

[A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.](https://i.redd.it/82b95bynpen61.gif)

As you can see, our fellow 🦍 Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"".Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

[Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/h9jkzo3qnen61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=3377a44f22eb8fc0c0302c0051528dbe7d40e359)

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

&#x200B;

[Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d5ry6vxloen61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4f4345f6bc553b8c20d4fc22b551bf73fb825d5)

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mindblowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. 🤯  I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

# So you are telling me that fellow 🦍 Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first 🚀 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

[Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January ](https://preview.redd.it/ls6yg89ksen61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=02df84510f42b367541792896e09ba836e92c9a7)

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our 🚀 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

&#x200B;

[What actually happened after that \\""prediction\\""?](https://preview.redd.it/j7tjz2dqten61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c100b502fe38eb3ec9c1082cad758f4fbfc09b7)

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our 🚀  take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

# OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

[Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.](https://preview.redd.it/siqakz1even61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=45d7c5d21886747740e29cafe72c0b0364f52785)

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

&#x200B;

[🚀  Pre-Launch](https://preview.redd.it/tnm459b4wen61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=69cec8c0ff7a0d85a407b27ba1adab1a1a1694ce)

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few 📄 🙌 bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impuls that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our 🚀 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the 🚀 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**

**EDIT #1:** I started learning the Elliot Wave Theory last year. Two predictions I published last year based on Elliot Waves were the [A-B-C correction in TWLO in October](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TWLO/JJ2castF-Twilio/) (although my floor for C was a little too low) and wave [3-4-5 for TSLA and the $2,000+ price target in July](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/iTTc7EjH-Tesla-Going-for-2-000/) (unfortunately, the stock split ruins the replay, but you can check the chart for yourself to see how accurate my predictions were)

**EDIT #2:** Since some of you are asking if all of that even applies during a squeeze I looked for a chart of a recent short squeeze and if you take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10neu61](https://prnt.sc/10neu61) you'll see that the TSLA squeeze in 2019 also follows the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave pattern.

**EDIT #3:** In addition to ""EDIT #2"" to prove another point, take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10nezpr](https://prnt.sc/10nezpr) and you'll notice that wave #3 of the TSLA squeeze by itself is another 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave.

**EDIT #4:** [https://prnt.sc/10nh43c](https://prnt.sc/10nh43c) shows the weekly GME chart with Elliot Waves from the low last year until now and also indicates that we are currently in wave #3 that will take us to $9,193 - $10,805 followed by wave #4 (short drop not visible in the screenshot) and our final take-off with wave #5 (also not in the screenshot).

**EDIT #6 (#5 is at the top): Here are a few things I personally won't do:**

1. **I won't try to trade those waves, but simply HOLD because I don't want to risk missing the take-off because those price levels aren't set in stone or guaranteed.**
2. **I won't sell on the way up but wait for the top and sell on the way down. Because the price could go way higher than predicted and I rather sell at 80% of the top on the way down than selling at $100k per share** [just to see the top at $1,000,000 or higher](https://prnt.sc/10ni1ei).
3. **I won't invest money that I can't afford to lose.**

**EDIT #7:** Updated link in Edit #6 to include wave #5 prediction on GME weekly chart. Although, I want to point out that I rely on the hourly chart and use higher and/or lower timeframes only for confirmation.

**EDIT #8:** I've uploaded a new video to my latest YouTube channel and in it starting at 10:31 I show how I apply Elliott Waves to GME. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjOUxNuzw3E&t=631s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjOUxNuzw3E&t=631s)",2021-03-16 17:02:49

Not only for a great amount of wealth but the knowledge that accompanies it. I would’ve never of understood any of what I do now if it wasn’t for gme.

After my parents divorced ~14 years ago, I moved out with my mum. We lived in poverty for years, and eventually became homeless. It was a terrible thing for any child to have to grow up experiencing. After several years of things like house-sitting, staying with her friends, etc. we were finally accepted into government subsidized housing, and we could finally try to live again. It was the best thing that had ever happened to me by that point, having that stability was so incredibly relieving for both of us.

Now that I had a home, I was able to go to highschool and recieve a proper education. I could have friends again. My mother was my favourite person in the world, and she always gave everything she had to the people that needed it. She taught me that I should love and help everyone I can, and it's something I'll never forget. She died on my birthday in late 2019 due to breast cancer, and I still live in the same government subsidized housing to this day (The assholes in charge of the housing here wanted to evict me - a then 19 year old - two months after her death, but COVID-19 made that impossible, lol. This is a message to you shit stains in management, GO FUCK YOURSELVES! Especially you, Brad. Nobody likes you).

She must have put everything she could into making sure her life insurance policy was the best it could be, because when she died I was shocked by the amount I recieved, especially considering we were so poor. I've invested a third of it into $GME, and if this thing truly moons then it's my plan to help as many people as I can with the money I get. I want to build more affordable housing for people that are going through what I went through. I want to help people that have a hard time finding and keeping jobs because of their criminal record or mental illness/addiction. I want to help build a world that fosters love and kindness just like she taught me.

I hodl for her, I hodl for her memory and the things she believed in. I miss you, mum.

If you are getting paid to post FUD or are a hedge insider with detailed knowledge of the manipulation that is clearly going on - you could make bank and save your reputation (not to mention your future career options and earning potential) at the same time. As an example - the SEC recently paid $50,000,000 to a whistleblower who ""provided detailed, firsthand observations of misconduct by a company.""

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/sec-record-millions-whistleblower-award-program-total-payment-amount-payout-2020-6-1029282473?op=1](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/sec-record-millions-whistleblower-award-program-total-payment-amount-payout-2020-6-1029282473?op=1)

There are a ton of federal protections for whistleblowers and there is an entire legal industry out there to help whistleblowers facilitate their claims:

[https://www.whistleblowers.gov/](https://www.whistleblowers.gov/)

While the SEC may be crooked - the DOJ and other federal offices will be involved in serious claims and the SEC will be forced to behave (or you will see job terminations and SEC insiders going to jail - which would be great). Regarding SEC claims - rewards are typically equal to 10% to 30% of the funds the SEC or CFTC collects based on your information, provided more than $1 million is collected (this case would easily blow previous records out of the water and the reward could be astronomical).

One of my law school professors was a former U.S. Attorney at the Department of Justice and wrote one of the leading treatises on whistleblowing. There are a lot of resources out there like this:

[https://www.amazon.com/Whistleblowing-Rewards-Reporting-Against-Government/dp/1940011159](https://www.amazon.com/Whistleblowing-Rewards-Reporting-Against-Government/dp/1940011159)

If someone out there has a serious claim - they should contact an attorney who specializes in guiding whistleblowers through the process. They'll work with you on a contingency fee basis and will know the precise people at each federal office to speak to (obviously half of a successful strategy is knowing the right political strings to pull):

(there are a lot more out there - just google ""federal whistleblower attorney"")

In closing - there is a lot of negativity on here about taking things to the authorities. Here is the thing though - while there is certainly corruption at all levels of government - there are good guys in government too. Every single year cases like this are resolved in a manner in which justice is served and a whistleblower ends up as the hero of the story. Obviously no outcomes are guaranteed - but if you're an insider sitting on this information - ask yourself who you want to be when the music stops.

Secondly, if you decide to sell and you miss the rocket youll get fucking depressed. You could lose out on millions. Is it worth saving a couple of thousands bucks to miss the chance of being financially secured for the rest of your life? Give that som thought.

The last thing you need to understand is that a big share of this community has holding this stock from 40 to 450 to 40 to 350 to 200. It takes time to adjust to the dips, and it might be scary, but the upside of holding is so big. Selling will only delay the inevitable squeeze

So, we have 200,000 active members.  If all of us bought just 25 shares, that would give you your $10,000,000!   But I’m pretty sure that most can buy at lest x10 that amount ( I keep buying the dip and currently at 8000 shares).  But if every user who wants it to go to the moon just do their small part and contribute at least $250 this week  or 5 shares/day, I’m sure it will be enough to start tipping the scales.  Now, if we really wanna go to the moon and act instead of talk or hope and repeat this   5-10 times( I’m sure anybody can borrow at lest $1500 to make the profit of  at lest x10 to x10??? in a month. You won’t even have to borrow if you balance your spendings and will most likely find that league, realising that if you stay home for 2-3 weekends instead of going to the bar/taking a long drive upstate/postpone buying that ps5/laptop/8ktv for another month, you will have that money yourself.  The previous comment said add 3 zeros, which would be 10 billion, and way too much with the current market cap of 4.07 billion.  All we need is a catalyst of about 100,000,000 tops to ignite that short squeeze( That was the goal all along, not donating 2.5x the amount of market cap to the company for no reason).   So if everybody who wants to make at least 100% on the stock, and doesn’t do anything, might expect it to go nowhere.  Because unless we all contribute and not count on the next guy to put double the amount for you, nothing will happen.   Do you really want this to moon?  Then start buying 25 shares/week(this is honestly not a crazy amount and everybody over 12 can come up with that money).  Who ever can’t come up with 1500/week, buy whatever you can, I’m sure 5 stocks won’t make you bankrupt!  Buy whatever you can, and if all 200,000 will buy whatever they can, it will even put as some can buy only 5 while others 5000!   Nothing will happen till we all contribute starting now and buy the stock, please, realize that!  So let’s buy whatever we can for the rest of this month and the short squeeze might start before the end of it.  Again, it will only be possible if people put their money where their mouths are and start working together.   Otherwise, the HFs will kill the stock slowly as the only way we can come up with more money then them if every single person of 200,000 members contributes!   Start today people. It’s not like I’m asking you to donate, it’s your chance to make x10-20-30-x???? on every dollar you contribute.  I’m not asking you to help me and donate money, I’m asking you to act in order to help yourselves get that huge payday, better sooner then never!  Please, don’t disregard this and start buying as much as you can.  You won’t regret it when it goes to $100+.  But it never will unless you start working as a team starting yesterday.

So this part about the eSLR rule is interesting, but it didn't hold up. Next I will show some 2020 data from the same author which shows the collateral multiplier back up around 9 in April 2020.Source: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2020103pap.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2020103pap.pdf)

Notice collateral multiplier is defined as the ratio between the black line (U.S. Treasury SFTs) and the red line (non-rehypothecated).

Could a much smarter ape like u/atobitt give some insight here? This looks huge, but I don't completely understand what I'm looking at here.

Sorry if it's a bit rushed, I wrote it during my lunch break. I'll respond to comments later.

Edit 1: Great analysis from u/weeknddev 

>7x leverage on encumbered capital and more than 85% is rehypothecated. This is like taking 85% of the same banana until there is no banana left. I would suspect that 7x exposure is low. Why?  
>  
>Those who do not exceed 700b in capital only have to report monthly as of this publication. That means at any given time they could be several factors more rehypothecated betting like fucking degenerates. And like in other posts because their money comes from derivatives, they are able to sell them and make out like bandits. Truly bandits.

Why I was banned and addressing some of my concerns about the sub.",1617530081.0,"# Preface

Dear r/GME,

It's Warden. Hope you are all having a good weekend! Stay rested, take care and be ready because I believe there will be many ups and downs ahead. Buy and Hold. This is the way.

**If you are a mod reading**, please message me if this breaks any rules and I will edit it and kindly ask you to unremove the post.

I'll let some comments from the community help guide this letter. First and foremost, some people are probably thinking:

**I agree with him.** I was originally going to *briefly* address this on Monday during my daily charting post, but decided I'd rather not dilute the purpose of my daily charting post. So I've instead written this letter to independently address the recent drama.

**I know many of you haven't been following my posts since I began posting, so I'd like to use this opportunity to help catch you up.** I post DD on this sub and I usually do a daily live charting thread.

For example I authored these two DDs:

&#x200B;

Now back to the discussion at hand.

# An apology to the community

Recently I was banned for violating the rules.

https://preview.redd.it/qv1o4jfd12r61.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ed2717c30ac24c6dbe07dc1d31e480f05b53475

I didn't realize ""Improper Content"" in Rule 6 included no self promotion, so I made an honest mistake.

I was part of a band before university (I played the guitar and I couldn't sing too well) and we always left our tip jar at the front of the stage during gigs. Ever since I started streaming on YouTube, my friend told me about Kofi as a way to setup a tip jar online. Whatever I make, I put towards trading software and GME. There is a full disclaimer on my page about it. Know that I am extremely grateful towards this community, and that if I wasn't spending all my time working on research and school, I would write you a personal thank you message. I still do 1:1 chats and I do them free now. I like talking with people and teaching.

**I apologize for linking my personal links on this sub and will keep it out of the sub going forwards.**

I enjoy doing DD and teaching people, and **I will continue to do so freely as I have always done** since I began posting.

# How we can improve this community. I'd like to address some concerns I have about rule enforcement.

Moving on, I have seen some hypocrisy on the sub when it comes to rule enforcement. Remember this post by u/philocoraptor?

https://preview.redd.it/fjvxrn0ux1r61.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=63e22047cf834b607066083f6c336fa6c78bc1c6

The rule I broke does not harm or discredit people. It was instantly removed.

Yet u/philocoraptor's post which does both of those things, is still up right now. It is hypocritical, given that his post, imo, breaks many rules, and also discredits and harms.

**All posts should follow the rules.** u/philocoraptor's post remains up however.

u/philocoraptor's says:

>I bear the guy no ill will

This is misleading judging by his response to my request for a discussion in the comments.

I ask you the reader, was he really open to ""debate"" in the first place?

&#x200B;

Rather this was the true message he wanted to deliver to the community.

>This is about you being a leech on this community

**And this already violates Rule 2 and Rule 4.**

Notice how he doesn't bold ""Tendiez shirts"", so if you were skimming this post and only read the bold, it's easy to see that ""Predatory practices for money in the end"" could be tied to me. I never put any of my DD or streams behind a paywall and never will.

It is also misleading to say that

>Technical analysis is almost useless for the movements of the stock so heavily manipulated

Here is how I responded to someone on Twitter about this topic.

https://preview.redd.it/e6gb3dtuy1r61.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3dee066c2d7e17a094f7fd29d623e76d989c5c8

If options are what moves most of the stock in the first place, then how is my options TA useless? Here was the bull trap example that was clearly forecasted:

[Screenshot from my 4\/1 daily post.](https://preview.redd.it/oqobwkj4z1r61.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=d217164ef3c109c0efb233eb480a39ee0754ee59)

A couple hours later:

[Bull Trap confirmed](https://preview.redd.it/yyjk3cz6z1r61.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=1681929000d9e3e4f966117c5bce0e21a1a95f95)

If people followed this edit, they could have bought more shares for a cheaper price by avoiding this bull trap. In fact someone did and said they were able to avoid the trap (I cannot find his comment, but it's there somewhere).

&#x200B;

I find it hypocritical when he says

>This isn't about your TA accuracy.

He tries really hard to disprove my accuracy.

https://preview.redd.it/1hox1x4v22r61.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f05484ba8f7ea02d4903fb58ba4e22078e957bc

This is not ""technical proof of my claims"". **He did not tally my predictions and objectively back these statistics with evidence.** In fact, he is just guessing and throwing around numbers to confuse people and raise Fear Uncertainty and Doubt on my DD.

https://preview.redd.it/zjym4y0k32r61.png?width=280&format=png&auto=webp&s=399f299d486b46a3a1a6562a593e4599851834fd

>I'd **guess** he's correct \[...\] 20% correct \[...\] 60% prediction window

All just fancy numbers to confused people and hide that fact that he did not tally my predictions or have any substantial evidence to back his claims.

I take pride in my accuracy, and most of my readers can attest that my accuracy is very high. Not 40%, **but somewhere around 80-90%.** I haven't bothered to tally myself, most of my posts were messed up from edit problems. But my oldest readers can probably attest to my own estimate.

He has to say ""This isn't even about Warden"" when clearly it is about me from all the evidence I have presented above.

https://preview.redd.it/5yg1andr32r61.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=df7d9154f8fdbd4dd6e16fb9daba76ce72ace6ab

This wasn't a ""direct conflict of interest"" either. **My DD has always been free and will continue to be.** What isn't free is the options software I pay for to provide that DD. Everything goes towards making my DD and supporting the GME cause.

# Trying to understand how u/rensole and u/HeyItsPixel feel through my perspective

I spend my entire weekend reading through whitepapers, books and doing research to prepare for my streams and daily posts. I have to put together an agenda and make sure the content and ordering of ideas makes sense. I have to fact chat all of my evidence, and even after hours of fact checking, I still gloss over some details. I have to comb through several weeks worth of options data to make sense of it all, and then group it together into a thesis that I can present to the community.

I'm sure u/rensole and u/HeyItsPixel spend a lot of time doing research and trying to make sense of all the data so that they can deliver DD to the community. I find it upsetting when I read comments that try to discredit or attack members of our community and especially those that put a lot of time and effort into research while some of these attackers never once posted DD themselves.

https://preview.redd.it/0baqn2hf72r61.png?width=2251&format=png&auto=webp&s=74b98b2e88e9b49fb23333ca5c7f600f479a0dfb

Checking u/philocoraptor's post history, there is nothing here besides his one post attacking me.

# Summary

Anyways, I don't want to let this letter run too long so I will end it here.

I sincerely appreciate my supporters. Your kind words have kept me going and helped inspire confidence in my own writing. I am grateful for this community, and only seek to make it a better place. I hope that this letter can result in positive change going forwards.

**TLDR;** I kindly ask the mods to enforce all rules equally and to think about how to address divisive, hateful comments on this sub. Especially when those posts create more harm than good, violate multiple rules and don't get taken down or addressed while posts violating just one rule, with no ill intent towards the community get instantly removed.

Thank you and have a great weekend everyone,

Closing around 190.40 ish. Webull updates the closing price a little delayed. I'm expecting good things to come in the coming weeks. Have a great weekend everyone!

**Edit 33 3:43PM:**

I appreciate the kind words everyone :D

Pure speculation, but I believe that they were using Call options to prolong this larger bull trap before they unloaded and tanked the price. By using Calls to maintain a positive delta pressure, selling to close those Calls could induce a net positive delta position on the Market Maker. Now that they have such a large net positive delta, MMs needed to unload shares.

https://preview.redd.it/ty06qi198mq61.png?width=2138&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e78a56ad05291d38b5333bb9512a5c458085872

**Edit 32 3:37PM:**

And it seems just about now, those 6 million dollars worth of 250 strike Puts have taken effect.

**Edit 31 3:25PM:**

Seems someone with a 2013 old account with no post history suddenly makes 1 post attacking me. A lot of 1 day/1 week old accounts in the comments doing the same repeating the same things.

All I'm going to say is I bought 100 shares of GME today at the dip I called out. As I said, I put everything into OptionSonar and GME.

I try to teach and deliver my financial knowledge to you for no added incentive. In my past streams, I've gone over strategy, options, company financials, understanding institutional ownership and other topics. I don't just do TA and as I have said on stream, I don't do the typical TA that would not make sense for a manipulated stock. I try to understand options to account for stock manipulation and I'll continue to try my best to educate you all on what I think is happening with the price.

No I won't post my links here again and I've never actively asked for people here to pay attention to them in the first place. I only setup a page on that site because I started streaming. I appreciate the kind people on this sub and just want to make that known.

I will continue to post here freely as I have always done.

**Edit 30 3:05PM:**

There is however an imbalance of Dollar volume for Puts than Calls so I'm investigating why those 250 Puts aren't having as much of a downward effect on the stock price. Possibly those 65 strike far ITM Calls we saw earlier today created a delta positive imbalance on MMs.

**Edit 29 3:02PM:**

Delta hedging from options is more immediate during unprecedented moves like the bull trap push we saw. The new Puts are far ITM Puts (Puts with strikes above market price are far ITM).

If the MMs have a delta positive position, they can write those Puts without selling. If we don't see major downwards pressure, we can assume the MMs are currently near delta neutral.

**Edit 28 2:51PM:**

Shorts are having none of it. They've flooded in their Puts finally.

190 Calls keeping us up for now.

**Edit 22 1:57PM:**

Ok so I think they could be using those to reset more FTDs and setup for more shorting. Possible second fire sale.

**Edit 21 1:49PM:**

I don't believe I've ever seen them do Deep ITM Calls twice in a row before.

**Edit 20 1:48PM:**

Another anomaly. I will investigate.

**Edit 19 1:31PM:**

If we see a fight for 200, GME will have a better chance of spring boarding past the Put wall.

**Edit 18 1:30PM:**

Imo the 200 resistance is too hard to break. They need to break that to take advantage of the high call inventory there.

**Edit 17 1:28PM:**

Lol that's unless they want to push this above 250. Volume ramping up. Perhaps attack by the long whales to break the trap?

**Edit 15 1:06PM:**

IV crush hitting hard. We're almost back to pre 2/24 IV. IV crush is when implied volatility settles down. This allows for long whales to buy options at a cheaper price.

Puts trickling in slowly. More downwards pressure likely.

**Edit 13 12:29PM:**

No major updates on options. Ticker following the rough trajectory I drew in edit 6. Floating a bit higher than expected. Puts haven't flooded in yet. Perhaps an end of day firesale?

**Edit 12 12:26PM:**

System.out.println(""I'm back"");

**Edit 11 11:40AM:**

No major changes in option sonar. GME still moving as expected.

The only person that I know has data on those 65 strike Calls (edit: is gone). Don't want this to have any negative connotations.

**Edit 10 10:55AM:**

Puts slowly increasing. These shorts are too easy to read.

Does anyone have optionsonar data for 3/19? This will be very helpful in my investigation!

Very very soon, we should see an increase in the amount of Melvin's Puts. This will drag the price back down for Fire Sale #2 towards the end of the day.

**Edit 3 9:39AM:**

Typically we see a bounce around 9:50AM during a Melvin firesale. So get ready to grab some shares! Could bounce either on the 187.5 or the 184.5 supports.

**Edit 2 9:32AM:**

Eerily low volume. 200k on the first minute candle on Webull. Very similar to 3/18 during the last attack by Melvin.

**Edit 1 9:30AM:**

I'll make an update as soon as anything pops up on my option sonar.

Back in early March, Melvin and friends were panicking like crazy. Every other day, they would buy these Deep ITM calls, and the next day, they would short attack with loads of ITM Puts. Seems they are back at it again! It's been 2 weeks since we've seen them do this.

We will do this with integrity, honesty, and class. I understand your fear, as it is the same fear my son had, that eventually he couldn’t handle any longer. You’ve changed the world and provided great DD for beginners to advanced traders. You’ve brought hope to those of us that never felt the stock marketing would treat us fairly.

Here is an overview for things to look out for this week regarding GME. Pray that Automod doesn't nuke me again.

🚀 **Option Chain Overview (As Of Close on Friday 3/19)**



Strike | Calls ITM | Puts ITM | Buying Power (# of Shares) | Total C&P ITM | % Calls | % Puts | Spread
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
170 | 5,881 | 6,400 | -51,900 | 12,281 | 47.89 | 52.11 | -4.23
175 | 6,157 | 6,086 | 7,100 | 12,243 | 50.29 | 49.71 | .58
180 | 6,324 | 5,810 | 51,400 | 12,134 | 52.11 | 47.88 | 4.24
195 | 6,778 | 5,302 | 147,600 | 12,080 | 56.11 | 43.89 | 12.22
200 | 7,998 | 4,252 | 374,600 | 12,250 | 65.29 | 34.71 | 30.58
250 | 11,528 | 2,681 | 884,700 | 14,209 | 81.13 | 18.87 | 62.26
300 | 16,747 | 1,118 | 1,562,900 | 17,865 | 93.74 | 6.26 | 87.78
350 | 19,121 | 946 | 1,817,500 | 20,067 | 95.29 | 4.71 | 90.57
400 | 23,057 | 799 | 2,225,800 | 23,856 | 96.65 | 3.35 | 93.30

**Pease note that this option chain will change as the week goes on. This is only a preliminary scan.**

In order for the Option Chain to favor the HFs, they will want GME to get below 175 where more puts will be ITM than calls.

The spread at 200 is more than double the spread at 195. If Hedge Funds can't get below 170, getting it below 200 is imperative for them as the spread begins to get out of hand.

Total Calls and Puts ITM stays steady from 170 to 200, however that number begins to increase dramatically beyond 200. That difference is made up by a dramatic increase in Calls falling ITM. This means that a Gamma Squeeze may occur at around 250 and begin to compound if it reaches 300, 350, etc.

Actual GME Shorts Available - 10,000

Effective GME Shorts Available through ETFs - 35,647

ETF Data Part 1
](http://puu.sh/Hr7UQ/cafaad22b2.png)

[ETF Data Part 2](http://puu.sh/Hr7Vr/abd3aaf1dd.png)

These are the numbers of shorts that HF's can borrow through interactive brokers that disclose their available shorts. This number does not represent the total number of shorts that HFs have that have not been placed in the market. This also does not represent shorts that can be borrowed from undisclosed locations.

Looking at this data though, it seems that HFs are really low on ammo. The 2 million volume that we saw at the end of Friday might have been a good portion of their reserves. We will still continue to see attacks throughout the week, but it will be interesting to see how powerful those attacks are.

Reminder that shorts need to be covered eventually.

🚀 **Closing**

This is the best data I have at the moment. I don't have access to a Bloomberg Terminal or any non-public information. I am not making any assumptions as to where GME will be by the end of the week. I am not telling anyone to make any sort of investment decisions. 

I am here to answer any questions and would be happy to discuss this data further.

Thank you!

The intention behind spreading these lies and deceptions is always some form of **divide and conquer**. They want to create actual division in these communities through fabricated bullshit and twisting truth into lies.

The most recent form I saw which prompted me to create this post, is someone talking about community members trash talking people for their easter religious beliefs in subreddits of heavily shorted stocks. They acted like the community members doing this were 'real'. The shills are going so far as attempting to create actual division, by trying to create the *bullshit appearance* that division is occurring. **It is not.**

The people doing these things, are shills. Attempting to divide the community.

**Regardless of the shills attempts, just remember that all you have to do, and continue to do. Is buy and hold.** **Nothing else matters.** They are constantly trying varying ways of manipulating you through lies and deceit to sell.

Thus far, the shorts and their paid shills have tried spreading every manner of lie and twisting of truth into lies. They will continue to do this.

Whenever you see some sort of information or attempt to divide the community in some way. It is almost certainly bullshit with ulterior motives, to manipulate you.

NSCC-801 is the companion amendment to DTC-003, which was recently filed and effective as of March 16th. Here are links to the filing and the notice of filing of NSCC-801.

[https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-05993.pdf](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-05993.pdf)

[https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf](https://www.dtcc.com/-/media/Files/Downloads/legal/rule-filings/2021/NSCC/SR-NSCC-2021-801.pdf)

# 🦍💬  What the fuck am I looking at? Words and numbers scare me and opening that link made me have a momentary seizure!

**DTC-003 TL;DR** — “Report your positions on a daily basis. Furthermore, liabilities arising from the misreporting of positions fall solely on the misreporting party.”

**NSCC-801 TL;DR** — “We will use the position reports received via DTC-003 to calculate if it is necessary for you to contribute a supplementary liquidity deposit due to your positional risk. Furthermore, if multiple members have supplemental liquidity obligations in excess of $2B each, we can decide if it’s all on them, or if it should be split up pro rata among all members.”

# 🦍💬  Have mercy! You're hurting my feeble brain meats!

**DTC-003 TA;DR** — “You tell us what’s on your books every day instead of every month. If you lie about it and that lie causes us to lose money, you’re paying the bill.”

**NSCC-801 TA;DR** — “If your positions are fucked enough that you’re at risk of losing so much money it'll fuck us all over, we’ll margin call your ass so fast it’ll make your head spin. If two or more of you assholes were that much of a dipshit, we can make you pay OR we can make everyone in the gang have to chip in. They're going to fucking hate that and they’re going to want to prevent the possibility of that happening, so they’ll probably turn on your ass.”

# 🍌🍌🍌🦍🍌🍌🍌

# 🦍💬   So, when is this going to happen?

Here are possible outcomes:

* SEC does nothing. It takes effect 60 days from the date of filing.
* SEC approves it. It takes effect whenever the fuck that happens.
* SEC requests additional information. Countdown restarts at 60 days as soon as they receive that info.
* SEC asks for extra time because their brains have grown smoother by the day in the current market environment. They get an extra 60 days.
* SEC objects. It does not take effect. (In my personal opinion, I find this unlikely, as this amendment was clearly written as a companion/follow-up to DTC-003.)

# 🦍💬  Anything I can do while I sit on my ass and wait for this?

The SEC invites interested persons to submit views, data, and arguments for or against NSCC-801. You can submit it by either:

* Using the form at [http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml](http://www.sec.gov/rules/sro.shtml)
* Emailing them at [rule-comments@sec.gov](mailto:rule-comments@sec.gov) with File Number SR-NSCC-2021-801 in the subject line.

Please don’t fill their mailbox with apespeak and emojis, but making your opinion on NSCC-801 heard is never a bad thing. You are a participant in the market, one who may be affected by this rule if it passes, so your voice matters, and this is an opportunity for the SEC to hear from retail investors, who historically don’t speak up much on these things.

# 🦍💬   Hey asshole! You fucked up your DD!

Please let me know ASAP so I can make the correction. Most of this was written around 2AM CST, so I can't make any promises that I didn't flub one of the details when reading these filings.

# 🦍💬   This is handy info for a chimp like me. Can I have more of this wisdom?

If there is interest in me writing more informative posts in the TA;DR style on market-related subjects including but not limited to implied volatility, options, technical/fundamental analysis, options greeks, or portfolio sizing, please feel free to make requests. I would be happy to write them.

# 🦍💬   This is still too many words! I'm confused and I hate this.

Feel welcome to ask any questions you may have in the comments. I’ll try to get back to everyone to the best of my ability, and I'll add crayon drawings if you really need it.

# 🦍💬   🦍🍌‼️‼️  🌕🔭🦍🚀‼️‼️  💎🦍‼️‼️

# 😸👍

**Note:** This is a preemptive double-post, with the counterpart on r/wallstreetbets, in part because I anticipate the removal of at least one of them, and in part because I am tracking the concentration, volume, and frequency of upvotes/downvotes on either post. The objective here is to see if I can identify if one sub has higher bot activity than the other, and if there is any recognizable/actionable pattern to identifying botted vote manipulation. I am also personally curious if there will be a heavy difference in prevailing sentiment between the two subs.

**Edit 1 @ 8:30 AM CST:** I am surprised and grateful for the volume of positive feedback, and doubly surprised at landing a spot on u/rensole’s morning report. I am waiting in the lobby of the vet to pick up my kitten (who is fine, don’t worry), so my ability to research and reply is a bit limited, but I plan on adding more resources and links to this post as requested. Please look forward to:

# 🦍💬 “I’m worried the SEC will filibuster this filing or reject it outright. Can you tell me something to steady my frail, trembling paper hands?”

# 🦍💬 SR-OCC-2021-801 TA;DR

# 🦍💬 “The concept of time is incomprehensible to me, which is why I buy options with less than 7 days to expiration. Just tell me when this thing will pop off.”

# 🦍💬 More TA;DR posts as requested, including:

* Fundamental Analysis (DFV-style research) For Apes

* Technical Analysis (crayon drawing class) For Apes

Since these don’t directly pertain to GME, I will probably post them in a separate subreddit, which will be linked here when those posts are written.

706,"Be prepared for a large DIP fellow Apes and don’t get shaken out. Buy the DIPs, buy the RIPs and HODL (not FA;)",1622681094.0,"We know a flash crash is coming but this is nowhere near the end. Shitadel and friends are going to try and shake as many people out as possible between $50-$100 but the APEs who have been around since January(some even longer) know it will go much higher. Do not be fooled by the ample amount of FUD of people saying they are selling and you should too or saying that this can’t go much higher. If they are saying that they are either new and haven’t done proper DD or are shills in bed with the hedgies. 

Silverbacks that have been around awhile, try and educate as many new APEs as you can but don’t engage the shills. Report and ignore. There really are a lot of both and I’m afraid some of the new apes will be more prone to being influenced by the FUD. Remember, the hedgies HAVE to cover! There are more naked shorts and synthetics going around than several times more than the float and they will eventually have to buy every single share back at what ever price we dictate to cover. They have not even begun to do so and have in fact double, triple and probably even quadruple downed at this point because they continue to short it even as we speak. This is not the squeeze. This is all FOMO. The squeeze does not start until they begin to cover and they will not do so until they have been margin called and know longer have the collateral required by the DTCC to keep on doing what they have been doing. Expect a very large flash crash today but do not fall for it. It is to try and get as many people to sell as possible before the share count today. It is very important to keep your diamond hands strong as this will be what exposes all the hedgie fuckery and will show the world just how many fake/synthetic/naked shares they have introduced to the market. 

HODL strong and know your fellow apes are doing the same. Any shares bought by last Friday will have cleared by today and be eligible for the vote so make sure you all do your part when the time comes. I repeat. This is not the Squeeze. This is FOMO with new apes jumping in to get a piece of the price action. HODL the line Apes. BUY the DIPs. BUY the RIPs. HODL if nothing else. If the FUD gets to much for you, step away from Reddit and social media. Go for a walk or put on Netflix. Do anything besides let the the shills get to you and know your APE family is HODLing strong with you. You will not miss the squeeze when it happens. There will be a long few week run up(we are in the beginning stages now) to its peaks and then will chill there trading sideways for probably 3-5 days before it starts down so do not think you will miss the squeeze. Ignore news reports saying this is it. It’s targeted FUD but the squeeze isn’t squoze until the hedgies COVER. 

Also I can know longer comment to AMCstock after they last raised the karma requirements but I have been seeing a lot of FUD over their the last few talking about how there is know way the price can go higher than XXX. Please correct these apes on the situation. I know some are shills but a lot just seem to be new apes who genuinely down know how crazy of situation the hedgies have got themselves into and  are just parroting major news sources (and we all no how very wrong they are on pretty much everything).. So please APEs, take the time to educate your fellow APEs especially the new ones as they play a vital rule in keeping the volume up and new buyers coming in. Make them feel welcome and answer any questions they may have. Fling shit where it is deserved to be flung and respectfully engage with those that are actually trying to add a wrinkle or two to their smooth brains.

Just read a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mft5xs/its_a_bit_funny_warden_has_done_some_super/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) where OP claims that Warden is a shill because he says that 10k is the ceiling (in his livestream) and that he uses terminology like ""if it squeezes"" which makes him a Shill.


1. They used this tactic when u/HeyItsPixeL got his Endgame DD wrong and now they're using it to discredit u/WardenElite, don't fall for this shit.


2. Warden didn't say 10k is the ceiling, he said it is if we don't hold. He also then went on to say that 1 Mill is possible if we all hold? You see that? That right there is what the shills and Hedgefucks are amazing at, censoring information. CNBC did that with the last Congressional Hearing, and here is a Shill doing it with Wardens words. I don't have no timestamps sry, but if I find any, I'll edit them in.


3. Warden's a smart donny. He uses ""if"" because there's still that one small chance that this could all blow over, that the government might step in and set a sell price. Its highly unlikely, but the likelihood still exists, no matter how miniscule it is. Also, we're not seers. We're not time travellers. We can't see what the future has in store for us. We don't know that Ryan Cohen won't die, something that could absolutely destroy Gamestop's fundamentals, because everyone knows that he was the one who revived them. My point is it's clever to say if instead of when, that way you prepare for the absolute worst.


Remember the longer this plays, the harder it is for the HFs. They can only cover so many FTDs with so many synthetic shares so many times before someone notices and does something about it. They can only pay millions in fees everyday for so long. So what will they do to give them the upper hand, they'll try, with all their might, to change the sentiment around GME. Both out there in the media and here in r/GME. I mean take a look at r/wallstreetbets, how about all the people they've managed to ban with frequent reporting, and the suicide threats which they sent to Pixel. Its no doubt that they're getting scared, and they're using any resource they have to tip the scales in their favour. Remember your DD, read more, Do some of your own. Time is on our side so HODL.

**The Epidemic of Regulators Selling Out to the Highest Big Finance Bidder & Undermining Public Confidence via the Revolving Door Must be Outlawed**

**Washington, D.C.** **–** Dennis M. Kelleher, President and Chief Executive Officer of Better Markets, issued the following statement in response to [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/citadel-securities-hires-ex-cftc-chairman-tarbert-as-legal-chief?sref=mQvUqJZj) that the most recent Chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was just hired by Citadel Securities:

“The announcement that the most recent Chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has been hired by Citadel Securities as its Chief Legal Officer is just the latest regrettable example of a senior government regulator appearing to sell out his public service to big finance via the revolving door. Recent ex-regulator hires at Robinhood, Coinbase, D.E. Shaw, Apollo Global Management, Spring Labs and many others preceded this latest revolving door hire by Citadel. 

“This is little more than legal corruption and bribery. That’s why the revolving door used to be looked down upon as disreputable and sleazy, often referred to as ‘influence peddling.’ This undermines the trust and confidence in government by the American people and it demoralizes the many hard-working public servants who sacrifice to actually serve the public.

“Out of hundreds of millions of Americans in the workforce, it is implausible that these people are being hired solely on the merits. They appear to be purchased, at least in part, for the insider knowledge, access, and connections they obtained while purportedly serving the public. These revolving door purchases are examples of how Wall Street uses its economic power to buy political power to keep the financial system rigged to enrich themselves at the expense of retail investors, the financial system and, ultimately, the country. This corruption disgusts the American people and Congress should outlaw it by prohibiting former regulators from working directly or indirectly for any entity within their jurisdiction while in government for not less than five years.”",2021-04-01 23:11:41

# Disclaimer:

The aim of the post is to display some options trading data that I believe many of us haven’t seen. It is to contextualize abnormal options trading activity on GME and dispel some myths about the put open interest.

**BY NO MEANS DO I INTEND TO MAKE CONCRETE STATEMENTS ABOUT WHAT THIS DATA MEANS.**

I am an ape with a research & writing background, not a financial or markets one. I am good at getting to and presenting data. Courtesy of ape’s donations, I am now working full-time on investigating and writing about GME.

**I am asking for your input as to what we are actually looking at, how it works, and what the implications are. I am asking for the SEC, FINRA, and the relevant US Attorneys to tell us what this data means, and to what tune GME retail investors have been defrauded.**

## Throwback time:

* I am the guy which has been tracking deep-ITM call anomalies and reported the findings to the SEC, which you can find posts about here:

[The SI% is fake. I found 44,000,000 shorts that had their FTDs reset since January 1st using DEEP ITM CALLS.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mhv22h/the_si_is_fake_i_found_44000000_million_shorts/)

[DEEP ITM Calls Activity PT2 - April 1st](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mi31m6/deep_itm_calls_activity_pt2_april_1st_708000_ftds/)[Update on me contacting SEC about the 44m FTDs; Proposal for a 'The Game Did Not Stop' Project](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mkjaxs/update_on_me_contacting_sec_about_the_44m_ftds/)

* The above data seems very damning in light of the SEC Risk Alert paper which describes such anomalies to be evidence of Fail-to-Delivers being reset in order to circumvent the law and regulations regarding short selling.

# 5th of April

Now, it is the belief of some apes that on the 5th of April, there was no deep-ITM call activity due to my widely-read posts on the 31st March and 1st of April.

That is not my belief, because that would just be too hilarious to be true. If only Kenny saw how I lived.

However, the fact remains that in the week after those posts, that activity was lacking. However, new Open Interest opened up on random worthless puts again. That caught my attention and piqued my interest.

Here are the results of my almost 3-week investigation.

# Observation 1: GME has some of the highest put Open Interests across all stocks

**For the JULY 16 expiry, only S-P-Y has higher open puts.** For January 2022 expiry, it is rubbing shoulders in terms of open put interest with stocks that have 2-5bn shares outstanding, compared to GME’s 70m.

https://preview.redd.it/g0pl6tytkqv61.png?width=1648&format=png&auto=webp&s=8964e72e756c10a46deaf5337cce64788eabc106

# Observation 2: Majority of that Put Open Interest is in seemingly worthless deep out of money puts, mainly around $0.5 puts.

https://preview.redd.it/w4d73lsukqv61.png?width=1652&format=png&auto=webp&s=af4e77da9305efb4b595ca02dda7118e25a91e9d

Why is this interesting?

**These puts are the most worthless items in the GME options market.**

They are the right to sell 100 shares of GME at the strike price. Therefore, buying a $1 put is equivalent to betting that you will profit from selling shares at $1, i.e. betting that the price will be lower than ($1 — premium for buying the put).

**It is one of the four corners of the options spectrum. It is the worthless corner. Other three corners are far more valuable.**

1. The corresponding strike price calls $0.5—$10 calls are ‘deep-in-the-money’ — meaning the stock price exceeded the strike price, in these cases, by a factor of over 20x. For this reason, they are pretty much priced at (share price — strike price) as the likelihood of them being in the money is pretty much at 100%. They are very valuable.
2. There are deep-out-of money calls ($800c), but with recent volatility, reaching those prices does not seem impossible for long-dated July, Nov and leap calls. They have time value and volatility premiums that represent the likelihood of the price reaching $800 by the expiry date. None of these deep-OTM calls trade at sub—$0.05 premiums like the deep OTM puts do.
3. High strike price puts ($800p) represent the right to sell shares at $800, which is approximately 4-5x the current share price. Therefore, the price for these is close to ($800 — share price), they are very valuable.

All other strike prices for calls and puts are points along those scales. **The deep OTM puts we are looking at are at the most worthless end of the scale.** They in many cases trade at $0.01 premium per share, or $1 per put contract.

This seems insignificant, but when we look at the share numbers tied to these transactions — we MUST ask — **why would somebody do something so ‘insignificant’ SO MUCH?**

Additional proof to the worthlessness of these puts as well as the thesis that the holder of these puts is obtaining them for a gain other than financial:

**On Feb 5, the following puts expired:**

$0.5p - **22,163 OI expiring - 27,010 total** volume since creation

$1p - **15,281 OI expiring - 19,531 total** volume since creation

$1.5p - **6,951 OI expiring - 9,704 total** volume since creation

$2p - **4,793 OI expiring - 6,549 total** volume since creation

$2.5p - **4,671 OI expiring - 4,754 total** volume since creation

On Feb 12, the following puts expired:

$0.5p - **35,153 OI expiring - 43,835 total volume** since creation

$1p - **15,802 OI expiring - 22000 total volume** since creation

In many of these cases, the party who initially buys the put holds it until it expires worthless.

Options are the casino of the stock market. The options represent bets.

**What incentive is there to make such worthless bets over and over again at crazy volume?**

Or maybe the question we should be asking is:

**Why would somebody NEED to be writing these puts?**

# Observation 2b) Other stocks do not have such high open interest on the lowest strike price puts.

Here is a comparison of the Put Open Interest for GME against 4 other stocks. I have added the **total Put Open Interest** for the **LOWEST STRIKE PRICE PUT** for **EVERY EXPIRY**. I have then multiplied it by 100, for the maximum of theoretical shares linked to each contract, and divided it by the **TOTAL OUTSTANDING SHARES** for each of the stocks.

https://preview.redd.it/9jxaxa0wkqv61.png?width=1257&format=png&auto=webp&s=b023de9878bde2c21d532f3c6afa2c2fe196cde6

**Not one of the other surveyed stocks even touched 2% compared to GME’s 53.38%.** This is completely ignoring the facts that not one of those stocks is priced higher than $27, to GME’s current $160s. Many of the other stock’s strikes started at $10 and $15 for some expiries, which means that in some cases, the lowest put strike price available was above 50% of the current share price, while in the case of GME, most of these puts were placed at $0.5 and $1 strike prices, which were 0.31%-0.62% of the share price.

**If every one of those put contracts SOMEHOW corresponded to 100 shares, the total amount would constitute 53.38% of GME’s outstanding shares. And those are just the lowest strike prices. Can phantom shares be created in this way?**

We have a sniff of a clue in this paper:

# [Welborn, J. (2007): MARRIED PUTS, REVERSE CONVERSIONS AND ABUSE OF THE OPTIONS MARKET MAKER EXCEPTION ON THE CHICAGO STOCK EXCHANGE ](https://www.deepcapture.com/wp-content/uploads/2007.10.09-J-Welborn-Married-Puts-and-Reverse-Conversions.pdf)

***p1:*** *In hard-to-borrow securities, short sellers are illegally “renting” the options market maker’s exception from the locate requirement in order to obtain share entitlements and put options that they then sell and exercise for profit. In a married put, a short seller purchases put options from an options market maker who then \[naked\] shorts the same amount of stock back to the short seller as a hedge. If the stock sold is not a threshold security, then the options market maker may fail and never deliver. A married put can be disguised as a market-neutral reverse conversion. Married puts in Overstock executed, in part, on the CHX exchange indicate several layers of fraudulent, manipulative and criminal activity:*

*1. Engaging in securities fraud by knowingly failing to deliver securities*

*2. Mis-marking intentionally short sales as long.*

*3. Engaging in market making activity that is not bona fide.*

*4. Failing to comply with Regulation SHO close-out requirements (“rolling the fails”)*

*5. Agreeing in advance not to demand delivery through buy-ins (i.e., criminal collusion)*

***p6:***

https://preview.redd.it/l278qftwkqv61.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d8fb3bc4ca19b7206f8b4575fa3f8af720d69f

***p7:*** *The outcome of the married put is that the actual naked shorting occurs on the books of the options market maker. Regulation SHO says that, at T+13, the options market maker need not locate and deliver the “shares” he sold. Options market makers face no penalties for failing to deliver. Similarly, the short seller has no incentive to buy-in the market maker, as that would create upward price pressure on the stock—just the opposite of what a holder of a real or synthetic short position would want. Even if that were not true, it is common knowledge that buy-ins are rare. In a* [*2003 SEC Interpretive Release*](http://www.sec.gov/rules/interp/34-48795.htm.)*, the Commission expressed concern about “the manipulative sale of securities underlying a married put as part of a scheme to drive the market price down and later profit by purchasing the securities at a depressed price.” With increased scrutiny on married puts, anecdotal evidence suggests that they are being masked within market neutral trades known as reverse conversions. Classically, conversions and reverse conversions were riskless arbitrage transactions that converted common stock into options (and vice versa).*

***p9: “Those trades could be done to generate new “bullets” with which to depress the share price. It is also possible that the married puts are being used to roll failed positions.”***

**p9-10**: “*In May 2007, the American Stock Exchange* [*disciplined SBA Trading for abusing the options market maker exception through the use of fraudulent use of married puts*](https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/36560115/09-0008-sba-trading-llc-and-scott-arenstein-cboe) *and reverse conversions. It is a* ***FACT*** *that the Arensteins engaged in fraudulent options market making on this stock. This course of conduct enabled Respondents to maintain impermissible short positions in a number of Reg SHO threshold securities for extended periods of time.”*

**My comments:** The GME case is different from the one discussed in the Wellborn paper. Throughout the paper, the married puts cited are described and implied to be in-the-money puts. On GME, we can observe incredible out-of-the-money put anomalies.

However, not every tactic of the 2021 Abusive Short Seller will be described in papers from 1999-2013 that most of current GME DD is based on.

We will never have all the answers presented to us, though.

**However, from this paper and the SEC Risk Alert about deep-ITM calls, we can be CERTAIN that both calls and puts will show anomalies somewhere if fraudulent activity surrounding maintaining illegal short positions, creating phantom shares, and rolling failed buy-in obligations is taking place on a stock.**

This is just where I found the anomalies on GME.

It shouldn’t be my job as a retail investor to have to determine exactly how these anomalies link to and explain that activity, that is a job for the SEC, FINRA, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, as well as probably Chicago and Philadelphia.

**This is just the data I found.**

# GME Phenomena relevant to the Wellborn Paper

# 1. Abnormally High Put Open Interest on seemingly worthless puts

# MYTH:

The Abnormally High Put Open Interest on $GME **is a remnant of (possibly naked) shorting in 2020 and early 2021 (pre-January squeeze).**

**Implication:** Yes, there was naked shorting on GME, but it is possible this was covered in the January rally.

# FACT: These puts were almost exclusively opened DURING and AFTER the January rally.

https://preview.redd.it/u59nsz6ykqv61.png?width=2044&format=png&auto=webp&s=c29e60d301c6b2ef6a4089003fc38f26fb7adf74

The above graph is the **net change in open put interest** on all the puts that I suspect of having been manipulated.

**If the abnormally high put open interest was accepted as a remnant of pre-January naked shorting, wouldn’t this chart make that proof of naked shorting happening on GME heavily during the January spike, and also preceding the mid-March drop?**

A 1990 paper that I paid $25 for may hold a clue:

*“Our results indicate that securities with high levels of short interest tend to have higher betas and traded options and convertible securities associated with them.* ***Changes in the open interest of options are positively related to changes in short interest.*** *To examine this, we looked at coincidental changes of the open interest in firm options and changes in a firm's short interest. Table 5 reports the aggregate simultaneous increases and decreases in short interest and open option interest based on the expiration cycle. The statistical results are easily significant at the 0.01 level and indicate that* ***short interest and option open interest tend to move together***. Tests performed on individual years also were significant for each year. The short interest changes tend to be positively associated with changes in the open interest of options.***” -*** [Brent, Morse & Stice (1990) — “Short Interest: Explanations and Tests” (Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, Vol 25, No 2, June 1990)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-financial-and-quantitative-analysis/issue/FC6DD9EE2BFF94316B896BA21F6798FB)

This is the total puts opened since January, ignoring expiry. It assumes 100 phantom shares were indeed created for each of these suspicious put contracts. **Of course, market mechanics and the level of callousness of the naked shorter dictate that in reality, that number can be anywhere between 1 and 100, and as of now, we have no way of determining which. My suspicion is on the same side of 50 that yours is on, but there will be more data in a second to explain why.**

**If it is indeed true that between 1 and 100 phantom shares were created corresponding to every put, then between 1,277,520 and 127,752,000 phantom shares of GME have been created between 11th of January and 9th of April.**

**What else is new?**

# 2. Out-of-this-world Put Trading Volume 3 & 4th March

Going back through all these suspicious expiries, something else cropped up. On a range of them, several days had spikes of **trading volumes that far exceeded the put open interest**.

Exceeded how far?

As far as **232,364 traded volume to 1,155 open interest**. The equivalent of total open interest changed hands every few seconds in blocks of 500. This happened to a range of puts:

https://preview.redd.it/6wz99pr2lqv61.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=06363389108268849fcc67deea07a8c7d62a7c8e

This activity crops up on some other days, but not to this level.

# March 3rd and 4th were real anomalies:

[ Options Trading volume suspicious on grounds of volume far exceeding Open Interest, 11JAN-8APR ](https://preview.redd.it/th5hkeq4lqv61.png?width=1676&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdc7a017ef3b4c2da83a6e33bb4ddfe5c9017401)

# How out of the ordinary is this?

**Between MAR 3 & 4, a total of 1,676,236 contracts changed hands, both calls and puts.**

**This activity constituted 1,094,004 — or 65.26% of the options trading activity on GME for those two days.**

The next day, March 5th, there were only 388,638 contracts traded in total, even though it was a Friday.

All of this volume on March 3 & 4 happened across these strikes:

**^(9 APR 5p, MAR19 4p 26 MAR 5p, 1 APR 5p, JUL16 2p, JUL16 2.5p, 16 APR 1p, 16 APR 1.5p, 16 APR 2p , 16 APR 2.5p, 16 APR 3p, 16 APR 3.5p, 16 APR 4p)**

**So what the hell is this?**

I’ll tell you what it is not:

It is not any HFT, algo trading, scalping or **any way to make money.** One look at the transactions on the 9 APR $5 puts proves that:

**1,256 9 APR $5 put contracts were open after the trading session on 4-MAR-2021**

**But 232,364 5 APR $5 puts traded during the session of 4-MAR-2021:**

https://preview.redd.it/ply0r7x5lqv61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=370980aa31130e0a6a1ecd3e596c23f0e34b8f30

**— 230,009 traded between 13:56:14 and 14:51:40**

# — 229,997 traded at the same price, of $5 per contract.

Similar is true on other strikes with this unusual volume. **There was no profit opportunity here.** **The benefit had to be a regulatory / loophole one.** Why else would somebody generate “worthless” activity that exceeds the average option trading volume a couple times? Is this another way to reset FTD and buy-in obligations, like the deep-ITM calls? I believe contextualizing these spikes within the timeline helps us understand what they can be:

[ A hint, perhaps. ](https://preview.redd.it/wdiq1sc7lqv61.png?width=1680&format=png&auto=webp&s=886abbe49fbda8ef78890770ac048e7e2cad61d2)

# The Weird Coincidence

It is a good thing that composing this DD took a few days longer than planned. While watching some brainless TV, a lightbulb moment launched me from my seat.

What if I were to compare my two charts, and take the:

The Max Amount of Phantom Shares related to Open Interest up to MARCH 2nd…

And compare it to the Volume of the March 3 and 4th Put Volume spike.

https://preview.redd.it/hoidg2f8lqv61.png?width=961&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0b40d5b3d219fd80ba02a04a665869a911f11f1

**Those two numbers fit within each other almost perfectly.**

**So now, let’s get the SEC to tell us why this data is nothing to worry about.**

Because as a retail investor in GME, I am mortified.

The possibility that there are 127 million phantom shares on top of the rightful 70 million, does not fill me with confidence in the US stock market.

**Gary, pls fix.**

\---------

# ELIA ATTEMPT as requested:

1. Interestingly, **GME has abnormally high number of puts open out of all stocks**. It has more puts open than stocks that have billions and billions of shares.
2. Interestingly, **most of those puts are placed on ""worthless"" puts** \- around $0.5-10 strike prices, meaning bets that you will profit from selling shares of GME at $0.5-10. **Nonsensical bet to make. Let alone to make a million of these bets**.
3. Most interestingly, **those bets, hundreds of thousands of these puts, were primarily made during the January price run-up**, which makes them even more non-sensical.
4. There are proven incidents of married puts being used to mislabel or enable transaction that naked shorted a stock - creating phantom shares. **They worked differently than they seem to do here**. I can't say if this is the same thing.
5. All I know, is that there were **1,277m of these puts opened since January**, and most of the time, they haven't been traded. The party who creates/purchases these new puts has an incentive to hold them, other than financial. **It is my suspicion that each one of those puts corresponds to between 1 and 100 synthetic shares of GME being created**.
6. Interestingly, **on 3&4th of March, 1,094m puts were traded on strike prices that had 1000-6000 open interest**, making it highly suspicious. GME would get maximum 500-800k option trading volume across two hot days. 3&4 of March, they get 1.6m+, with 65% of it being this seemingly nonsensical activity. **All of the puts traded at the same price, offering no profit opportunity**. None of those puts remained open at the end of the day. It is my suspicion that **somehow they are being used to reset FTD and buy-in obligations**, in a similar fashion to the deep-itm calls.
7. **The number of puts opened from 11 Jan until the 2nd of March, the day before the trading spike was 1,096m. Those two numbers fit within each other to 99.75%.**

**What a curious story.**

If shills are allowed to continue harassing well known DD posters who get it wrong, other smart apes out there are going to look at what happened to those apes and think hey...its not worth it for me to post what I SUSPECT or what I THINK is happening because if I make even one mistake, phrase something wrong, misplace a fucking comma, these other apes are going to call me a shill.

Look, I get it, Pixel went a little bit overboard with the whole nostradamus prophet, 99.99% sure of squeeze thing and Warden (I don't really know what Warden did wrong, he like wasn't 100% convinced of the ceiling or something? Didn't provide enough hype on his stream? Whatever) did something. These people are putting themselves out there and providing content for discussion. If you don't agree with it, provide a counter argument! Don't just take out your pitchforks and start accusing them of selling out for Kenny G. Civil discussion is what makes us stronger, not emotional tirades against the person writing the DD.

The reality of this situation hasn't changed since January. The MOASS will happen but no one knows or could possibly predict when unless someone here works at as Kenny G's pool boy and has overheard him saying they're going to cover on xx date. DD here, in my opinion, serves to keep up interest in the stock and educate people on the intricacies of the stock market. When we're all worth millions we'll need to know how to reinvest that money right?

So as an ape what can you do? Simple, hold. And buy when you can. Start reading DD more critically and understand that the people writing these pieces are just regular apes, not fortune tellers. See what aligns with what you already know and for points you don't agree with, ask yourself why you don't agree with it and understand why that discrepancy exists. We're a community, we're here to help each other, strengthen each other through our numbers and collective knowledge. We're not a subreddit dedicated to the worship of rensole, warden, or pixel. These guys are just guys that have dedicated a significant portion of their time to sharing what they know and that's it. They're not fortune tellers or gods, they're just smart, generous apes and even smart apes make mistakes. Lastly, stop accusing everyone of being a shill, that really just helps the real shill generate a toxic environment.

You're the only one on hearth to have water, people need water to survive (HFS), so they all will come to you at the very ending, and they will be like:

 ""how much for wotah?"" 
""I don't sell it go away""

""No. Go away""
""100k?""
""Not interested""
""300k""
""If you want to survive mtf you give me 1mln""

Yeah, you got it, thats the point... you can sell your shares at the price YOU WANT, and there is NO LIMIT on how much it will cost to them!!!

They wanted to inflict the maximum pain on shorts while spending the least amount of money. way to rub 🧂 in the wound! 💎✋🚀🚀🚀,1616898970.0,"Hello my fellow Apes 🦍🦍🦍,

Today we are going to talk about a concept called **Max Pain** (no I am not talking about **Max Payne**, but he is pretty awesome too), and a theory for what happened with GME on Friday after we met resistance at $220.

https://preview.redd.it/1b2oy76cwlp61.png?width=460&format=png&auto=webp&s=62e727374d8ce96cbf337948772b0de36d6ea43a

\---------- **BOILERPLATE:**

I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀

**TLDR: After the Whales met any resistance to their upward campaign, they decided to call it a day, hit the SSR and inflict the maximum pain on the shorts using the least amount of money. Any price above $160 would do this. It will be exciting to see what will happen on Monday! 💎✋🚀🚀🚀**

&#x200B;

**---------- Max Pain**

First off, how cool is it that there is an actual finance term called **MAX PAIN**?!?!

Here is the quick definition of Max Pain, if you want to read more, [here is the investopedia link](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/maxpain.asp):

>**Max pain,** or the max pain price, is the **strike price** with the **most open contract** **puts** **and** **calls** and the price at which the stock **would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders** at expiration.  
>  
>The term max pain stems from the **maximum pain theory**, which states that **most traders who buy and hold** **options contracts** **until expiration will lose money**

&#x200B;

Manually calculating the max pain price is an arduous process (literally summing up the put and dollar value for each ITM strike price and then finding the one with the worst outcome), but luckily there are several websites that do it for you!

One of them is [maximum-pain.com](http://maximum-pain.com/options) and another is [Swaggystocks.com](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/options-max-pain/GME).

I prefer the look of [maximum-pain.com](https://maximum-pain.com) however it seems you can not look at historicals and now they only have April 1st data. Luckily I still had a tab open with [Swaggystocks.com](https://Swaggystocks.com), so I will use graphs from them.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/derng9xmxlp61.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=52ca2139f97dd8d718a0d88333ba621cce9dd618

What they give you is a pretty looking graph like this and essentially the **spot where the two colours intersect (calls and puts) and has the lowest total value is the Max Pain**. This means the least number of puts and calls will be ITM and will expire without being used.

The Max Pain price for March 26 was calculated to be **$160**.

Now from the Long Whale's prospective, **I think it is really the Max Pain on just Puts that they really care** about since I'm sure some of the calls were purchased by them. This means that any price ABOVE $160 would be the most painful for the shorts.

Lets look at the **open interest at the different strike prices**. the numbers represent the number of open options, not the value. Open Interest means that the option has not yet been used.

https://preview.redd.it/rc8ohzw10mp61.png?width=1443&format=png&auto=webp&s=03788c088518575ea652c9d59fce1a684d77343b

You can see that there is a **LOT of puts spiking right up to... $155.**

This suggest that the Shorts really wanted to get the price down to that level so their puts could start getting ITM and then they could take advantage of those puts to continue to drive the price down.

&#x200B;

**---------- What happened Friday**

https://preview.redd.it/sms9i81w0mp61.png?width=2033&format=png&auto=webp&s=a93832c64367dd31f093d9612e41139346d67fcb

**So here is what I think happened on Friday:**

* The Longs tried to **continue their upward campaign** right after the market opened. There was **2.7m in volume (7% of the whole day)** on the green candles in **only 15 minutes** between 9:37-9:52.
* However when they **met heavy resistance at $220,** they tried pushing through **1 or 2** more times then decided to **change tactics**.
* The volume **significantly decreased** and very little was spent on green candles. They probably calculated that it **wasn't worth pushing the price today** and instead try to i**nflict the most damage to the shorts** and spend the l**east amount of money doing it**.
* They then allowed the stock to slowly decline and when it was **close to the SSR limit**, I think it was actually the l**ongs that pushed it down so quickly, hitting the SSR and then immediately bought back the stocks** and continued pushing the price back up into the **$183 - $175 resistance levels.**
* After it went into this band, they just chilled and spent as little money as possible to just keep the stock there.
* At this level, **nearly all puts were OTM** just **rubbing salt into the wounds** of the shorts who spent tens or hundreds of millions this past week to only have the **price $10 lower than Friday last week.**
* **NOTE:** The **purple line** in the graph is the **VWAP** (volume weighted average price), you can see that even with all the ups and downs, the **VWAP hardly moved**, only going from $201 at market open to $193 at market close, which is actually MUCH higher than the VWAP at Thursdays close ($158).

**---------- TLDR:**

**After the Whales met any resistance to their upward campaign, they decided to call it a day, hit the SSR and inflict the maximum pain on the shorts using the least amount of money. Any price above $160 would do this. It will be exciting to see what will happen on Monday! 💎✋🚀🚀🚀**

731,DO NOT TO SELL $AMC AT A LOSS WHILE THIS UNFOLDS.,1612660107.0," “Investing for Ape Dummies 101.”

1. Ape buys 100 shares of AMC for $15.00 = $1500 
2. Price drops to $5.00. 🤯😱🤬🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️🖕
3. Ape 🧻🙌 sells 100 shares at $5.00 for $500 and takes a 66% loss. (-$1000)

A week later AMC is up 50% to $7.50 and APE regrets his fucking stupid decision. He decides to borrow $250 from another r/AMCSTOCKS retard Ape to get back in the game. Stupid Ape buys another 100 shares for $750.

Sometime later stock goes back to $15.00, which brings the fucking stupid Ape’s portfolio back to his $1500 original investment right? NO, WRONG!!!

Here is the problem most Apes forget to realize:

66% decline from $1500 is -$1000

100% increase from $750 is +$750

Though APE is back at $1500 his investment took a 16% hit as he still has to pay back the $250 he borrowed from his other Ape friend. For APE to truly break even his $750 position needs to increase  by 133%.

When trading stocks sometimes % movements matters more than $. What do you think is more likely to happen: For a stock to move up or down 66% or to move up or down 133%??

I love the saying ""actions speak louder than words"", and today I am going to show you how Citadel's changes in employment prove that they are a shit company and know they are FUCKED.

First things first, this is not financial advice. 

Now, every company worth a damned is very strategic regarding the size of their staff. HR Directors will have a strategic plan and optimal employee count planned out for months based on the CEO/Board's estimated future needs. It takes time and resources to hire and train new employees so  changes in current employment and hires/terminations can tell us what management thinks of the future. 

Linkedin has a cool feature called ""Insights"". This tab provides monthly data on employee count and new hires. Through looking at this data I came to a couple conclusions:   

1) They are a shit company that treats employees as completely expendable. 

2) Management does NOT have a positive outlook for the future of Citadel.

&#x200B;

Okay for number 1. A feature of this insights tab is a calculation for median tenure, which tells us how high turnover is AKA how much working there sucks. ""That sounds boring"" you might say, or ""why do I give a fuck?"". Well I'll tell why you fuck givers. If we can see this data for Citadel, we can also see it for Citadel's competitors... I looked at the median tenure of 7 of Citadel's direct competitors with active linkedin pages. Want to guess who had the highest turnover? That's right. Shitadel.

https://preview.redd.it/je6rl0hc4np61.png?width=398&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc32a89f72ce88ddf7325f689a5bbfcc547d1c7

Employees quit or are terminated almost a FULL YEAR earlier than at any of these competitors. Now we all have heard that working in Finance can be grueling and these numbers show this. Average turnover of these 8 is 4.5 years. But Citadel's is 1.6 YEARS below that! I mean no one else even compares to them. This is textbook example of a company that gives no fucks about their employees, works them to death, and then spits people out when they are ""no longer providing value"". Fuck them.

&#x200B;

Now that we know how shitty these assholes are, lets move on to number 2... lol. Below are the last 24 months of Citadel's Employee Count, New Hires, Terminations and Net Change. 

The first thing I would like to point out is that there are only 3 months in which workforce decreased: March 2021, August 2020 and August 2019. Now these two August reductions appear to be cyclical and based on a large number of new hires in June. I am going to speculate that these are probably summer interns, or new hires that didn't make the cut. 

Now lets focus in on the only month left with a negative change. March 2021 change does not mirror changes in March 2020. Additionally, the changes in employment for all 2021 months break away from a consistent trend of workforce increases. **For these reasons I believe that Citadel Management has rewritten their Workforce Strategic Plan to prepare for a negative future outlook.**

Below are charts showing 1) the number of new hires over time, and 2) Total Employee Count by month. Note in number 2: 6 month growth is dramatically lower than 1 year and 2 year growth.

Additionally, I looked at every single Citadel job listing on Indeed and every single one had been posted more than 30 days ago. THEY ARE NOT HIRING! 

[https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Citadel/jobs](https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Citadel/jobs)

If they had truly covered their short position and everything was ""business ass usual"" then we would expect to see continued workforce increases and regular new job postings. 

TLDR: Shitadel does not care about its employees and Management has changed their workforce strategy because they know shit looks bad.

Why you should buy $AMC in the coming days. (Don’t buy in pre market just wait till about 10-1030 for a good buy spot) 
1: let’s talk about the 8 million dollar man. At the buzzer that’s a message. 
2: AMCs buying on Friday was 55m buy 777k selling. That does not count short selling.
3:AMC is shorted 85 percent. They NEED this to end before the next short report comes out on the 15th. So new investors why not just hold for 2 weeks and see what happens. It won’t go lower then 7.70-7.90 Why do I say 85 percent? Because on Friday HFS shorted 35 MILLION shares on Friday alone. Just to beat us. They knew that if we lost the 8.01 fight it’d be the final crushing blow. Remember though. That was only friday I can’t imagine the last few days considering  the volume before Friday. Remember We’ve won the battle . Not the war
4: With the media downplaying this we as a group can prove what everyone already knows about the media. It’s fake
5: This stock will not blast off immediately tomorrow or this week it needs around 15-18 end of week to succeed. Remember we made a goal 8.01 and we hit it for the next week that’s ALL WE NEED! Hold and buy and spread the word 50-100 isn’t shit to most people 8 dollars definitely isn’t. Especially when they can make 600 a share at the least. 
6: I’ve seen major support line at the 7.70-7.90 range. I saw it a lot of 7.70 on Wednesday and 7.90 Friday. So if you invest just relax and turn off your phone.

Estimations for the total payout of GME based on Share Price. 🦍🚀🚀🚀 Yes all those numbers are possible because Math 🦍🚀🚀🚀

Because apes keep asking and saying that 1k, 100k, 500k, 2m, 10m, 20m is impossible, I've decided to help people out with learning how to use Geometric Mean. This lets us estimate the price per share as people jump off at different points on the way up, which is expected, everyone has a different price point, just as different sell points are expressed.


Geometric mean is basically an average of numbers that have exponential growth. For Apespeak, Bananas that grows more bananas as you eat them. You take the Max share price you expect, and then the current shareprice, and you calculate the Geometric Mean. This article explains it better than I can, I just am a retarded ape that loves crayons with colors out of space.


https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/what-is-geometric-mean/#:~:text=What%20is%20Geometric%20Mean%3F,investment%20or%20an%20investment%20portfolio



For argument's sake, we are going to use 150% short, so 75 million shares that need to be covered. The numbers below are the peak Price per Share, Total Payout of GME, and overall price per share for the payout.
So without Further ado


1k per share price total payout would be $33,525,000,000 @ 447 per share (Geometric Mean)


5k per share price total payout would be $75,000,000,000 @ 1000 per share (Geometric Mean)


10k per share price total payout would be $106,050,000,000 @ 1414 per share (Geometric Mean)


42k per share price total payout would be $217,350,000,000 @ 2898 per share (Geometric Mean)


69k per share price total payout would be $278,550,000,000 @ 3714 per share (Geometric Mean)


100k per share price total payout would be $335,400,000,000 @ 4472 per share (Geometric Mean)


500k per share price total payout would be $750,000,000,000 @ 10000 per share (Geometric Mean)


1m per share price total payout would be $1,060,650,000,000 @ 14142 per share (Geometric Mean)


2m per share price total payout would be $1,500,000,000,000 @ 20000 per share (Geometric Mean)


20m per share price total payout would be $4,743,375,000,000 @ 63245 per share (Geometric Mean)



TLDR: In summation, its really not as much as a payout as you think, regardless of its Peak.  So you might say ""Hey wait! X price is too damn much! We'd bleed the world dry and awaken Elder gods!"" And I say, ""Nay fair Ape, you'd only cause Azathoth to roll over. There will still be a world left to enjoy your tendies. Even at 20 mill per share.""

749,WHAT DOES AMC TO THE MOON MEAN?,1614282779.0,"Apes, with AMC reporting earnings at closing today the stock will probably be as volatile as we have seen in a while. Going from $11 to $20 or from $11 back to $6.00 is not a far fetched possibility. However please pay attention to this: (I’m not a financial advisor and this is not financial advise)

AMC at $20 is not the same as GME at $400. AMC has not started the squeeze zone yet so WE MUST HOLD the line together and let it ride up to $50, $75 and $100+. The momentum, technicals, short interest, contract expiration and most importantly “overall sentiment” are all on our favor. Selling the stock at $20 for 30%, 50% or even 100% profit is like eating a fried egg when you could bring a 30 lbs turkey home for a feast. When the stock hits $20, many of you will be tempted to sell it because that is how high it has been. DO NOT! Look what happened to GME yesterday (2/24)! When the squeeze starts it will happen with a monumental and brutal force. GME went up over 100% in the last hour of trading and almost another 100% after hours. From $49 at 2:00 pm on 2/24 to $168 at 8:00 pm on the same day. That is incredible and you DO NOT WANT TO MISS THE POTENTIAL FOR A SIMILAR AMC RIDE!

Many of you are asking: “What is the AMC price target?” When will I know we have arrived at the moon? Is it at 10X, 20X or 50X? I personally would love to hear your feedback and DD on the matter, but here is my answer:

The moon is as high as “WE” want it to be. If 10 million shares must be covered due to shorting, the stock holder decides how much they want to sell the shares for. However, logistically speaking, it is virtually impossible to ensure all retail buyers who are holding AMC execute their sell order at the same price point. Our personal needs, goals and strategies are all over the place. Nonetheless, AMC at $20 is likely the post Covid price target anyway.... but “IT IS NOT” the short squeeze target. LET IT RIDE UP BY HOLDING THE LINE MY FELLOW APES! 

NOW more than ever, we MUST BE PATIENT. Once the stock passes the $30-$40 range it may take off very quickly . DO NOT GIVE IN TO THE $20 resistance.

As most of you have heard by now I was put in a position where I was forced to resign as a moderator

&#x200B;

The past few weeks have been hard on the mod team, there where some problems and everyone has made some errors.

&#x200B;

For me personally it came last week when I got a slew of messages of people complaining about another moderator, yournameisc00l being banhappy, and there was something wrong with the discord as well. and a moderator trying to show off power by removing my posts as well.

&#x200B;

when I confronted c00l I wasn't getting any answers on any regards, flat out stating he would wait on the others. This in turn made me very paranoid as all hell. Then checking out the discord suddenly all the channels where gone for me except the one specifically made for me to take notes on DD. Knowing that channel was only visible to moderators I demanded answers now and did a @ everyone.

As far as I know this will only give a message to the moderators, but apparently this gave a server wide message to every user ,which is weird because as far as I know only mods can view mod channels.

Then I also reacted to a comment here on the sub, saying I have no clue what's going on with the Discord server, I am no longer a moderator there but I'll look into it. <this made a big problem apparently and was asked to delete it, so I did along with the message on discord.

and then got flack for deleting the message on discord because it made it so that there was confusion.

If that message did go out to everyone in the server I am very sorry, but given the laissez faire attitude I was getting from mr c00l and getting no responses from everyone my paranoia kicked into overdrive because I foresaw this as a WSB 2.0 situation.

&#x200B;

This in combination with the ""nahuh I'll wait for the rest"" attitude of mr cool had left me to take away his mod powers until the rest of the group could chime in.

(something the rest would do to u/redchessqueen99 once I was ill this past weekend.)

Now this same mod also banned Warden, I told the rest no wait because I wanted to talk to them and warden to make sure we could resolve this situation to at least not end in a permaban, as I did see it as a mistake at the time, as I believe there should be some communication going both ways and I do think context matters.  
Later I called for a meeting, stating I no longer believed mr c00l had the best interest of the sub in mind.

&#x200B;

they claiming I was a bad team player, which a case could certainly be made for, that I was self-aggrandizing which I don't agree with and saying I was doing this for self serving things which... again I don't personally see.

These things have lead the rest of the mod team to ""vote"" to kick me out, this was not a choice made by me but for me, I even wanted to stay on with limited mod powers to be able to at least help in some way or form. but no dice. and was asked to resign as a mod myself because of public image.

&#x200B;

I do have to state, I do however respect Chickthief and  thr0wthis4ccount4way, the two mods I have no clue on how the new mods from discord are as I had 1 or 2 sentences I talked with 0Wl and he was very nice to me.

I was always transparent with everyone here and would like to continue in doing so, thereby my writeup here and now.

I fully expect to be banned for speaking out, even though it's factually, and realize this could be my last post on r/GME

&#x200B;

I will most likely take my time and think about where I want to go from here, and am contemplating if I should continue with my daily's or not, as my intentions never changed but because I got kicked from the mod team it has given me food for thought. 

I wish everyone here the best regardless, I will be 💎👐 no matter what.

If I do end up getting banned I will most likely be in r/Superstonk  r/Spielstopp or another one.  
Again I first need to figure out if I even want to do it anymore, and I'll be posting this message to both.

I wish everyone the best",2021-04-05 10:28:44

The naked shorting scam revealed: lending of market maker privileges, the married put trade and why inflicting max pain will bleed them dry

The original post has been taken down on r/GME because the paper I linked to was hosted on an alt-right website. I DO NOT ENDORSE THESE POLITICS. The paper is legitimate and I would change the link to another host if I were not now banned from the subreddit. 

The paper referenced in this post is old and I note that the current situation has likely changed since 2008. However another loophole for a profitable scheme is quite likely to have been found. Any suggestions for how new rules could be bent to facilitate this type of scheme in 2021 would be appreciated. 

**TLDR**: Naked short selling privileges could be being illegally lent to short hedge funds by market makers. The married put trade and the even sneakier reverse conversion modification of the trade are described. These types of trade explain:

* how short interest has been manipulated in official reporting numbers
* how naked short selling has become so widespread
* why borrow fees can still be so ridiculously low
* that the vast majority of options (both puts and calls) might be due to naked short selling
* how short shares are 'washed' and able to be dumped on the market even during SSR
* why such a large number of way out of the money calls have been seen recently (actually part of a naked short trick, not long whales or gamma ramps)

Looking at open put interest *naked shorts sold might be at least 150-200%* of float!

With patience key options used for the manipulation will expire and the house of cards will collapse. Every time we hit max pain the shorts' pain increases. HODL!!

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

*Note: this is not financial advice. I am not a cat. I read some papers and made some interpretations. Any number of these could be flawed and wrong. Make your own mind up.*

**Introduction**

One of the big questions surrounding GME has been about the reported short interest (SI) since Jan: *How is it possible that reported SI is so low when all other evidence suggests that SI is astronomical in GME?*

Another question we all have is: *Why the fuck is the borrow rate so low when there are no shares available to borrow?!*

Here I will try to answer these questions and how they relate to GME and the options market.

While looking into naked short selling I discovered a few great resources that I will use here. The main one can be found here:

https://we.tl/t-fEa2TAsuac

Here's a little bit of background from the paper:

>“failures-to-deliver” (FTDs) are, in effect, phantom shares that circulate in the stock market as real shares; just as counterfeit currency destroys the value of a currency, phantom shares deflate the price of a company’s shares. FTDs are generated using a variety of mechanisms. One is through abuse of the options market maker exception, which allows options market makers to short shares they have neither borrowed nor located in order to hedge. Abusive short sellers or hedge funds are illegally “renting” the options market maker exception to obtain phantom shares which can be sold into the market.

These phantom shares have flooded the GME market. In January reported SI was 140% meaning without any doubt massive naked shorting was happening in GME. Now we see that institutions own anywhere from 130-200% of available float once again showing that naked shorting is rife. Finally if we look at retail ownership of GME it could easily be 100%+ of free float. Estimates are difficult but many other great DDs suggest huge retail ownership.

Here is a quote from a [letter](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/sonecon010504.txt) former Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Shapiro forwarded to the SEC based on his own research into naked short selling:

>When the number of uncovered short sales in a stock exceeds its public float-or even the total number of shares issued or outstanding--the only plausible explanation is a concerted and illegal effort by short sellers to flood the marketplace with counterfeit or fictitious shares, in order to artificially drive down the stock's price and increase the value of the shorts. Massive naked short sales turn the equity market into a form of monopoly pricing for the firms that fall victim to such sales, in which the short seller sets the price at a level guaranteed to provide a quasi-monopoly return. These actions, in effect, destroy the integrity of the market system for firms targeted by naked short sellers and create a direct transfer of wealth from existing shareholders to the illegal short sellers. The firms targeted for such manipulation are generally smaller, younger public firms - the type of company which has generated many of the techno logical and organizational innovations that have contributed so much to the increases in business investment and productivity of recent years. As relatively small and young companies with much fewer shares in their public floats than their older and larger counterparts, their individual decline or destruction also generally attracts little public attention.

Fuck these fraudulent fucks who sell phantom shares to put companies out of business. This time they have fucked with the wrong company because GME HAS A FUCKING SHIT-TON OF GLOBAL ATTENTION!

The shorts have never been faced with a horde of artistic apes who only know how to HODL, buy the dip and 💎🙌 till moon.

**How a hedge fund can fake SI numbers and sell naked**

One of the perks of being a market maker (MM) is that you don't need to play by the normal rules of FTDs and selling short. In the process of making markets, which requires hedging positions, market makers theoretically may need to sell stock they temporarily do not have. For this reason, Regulation SHO allowed market makers, “…\[an\] exception from the uniform ‘‘locate’’ requirement, as Rule 203(b)(2)(iii), for short sales executed by market makers, as defined in Section 3(a)(38) of the Exchange Act, including specialists and options market makers, but *only in connection with bonafide market making activities*.”

Although only MMs should have the ability to sell stock naked *it is possible to loan their privileges' to other hedgefunds to play short*. This image is taken from the linked paper and gives an example of naked selling for Overstock shares using a *married put* trade:

[ Example of a married put for Overstock shares ](https://preview.redd.it/mwmf4rxuz7q61.png?width=896&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dc49db83737283a0821f874c94f22b6ccedc36a)

Example of a married put for Overstock shares

This could be, *and almost certainly is*, being done with GME shares to hide SI and avoid massive borrowing fees.

The option market maker obtains a market neutral position. Selling puts, alone, would create a net long position. Thus, in theory, the option market maker’s naked short sale hedges against downward price moves. The option market maker receives a premium for the puts. In the example above, most of the $5 is the fee the market maker charges for “renting” his short sale locate exception allowed under Regulation SHO.

After the married put is executed, the short seller then sells the “shares” into the market. Every time the short seller sells a share, his net short position increases due to the decreasing long position in the GME stock. The end result is that he is long puts on GME, which is equivalent to being short.

So it is possible to short sell using MM privileges with an options trick and avoid massive borrowing fees for hard to borrow stock. THIS IS ILLEGAL AND CLEAR MANIPULATION OF THE MM RULES!

In a 2003 SEC Interpretive Release, the Commission expressed concern about “*the manipulative sale of securities underlying a married put as part of a scheme to drive the market price down and later profit by purchasing the securities at a depressed price*.” With increased scrutiny on married puts, anecdotal evidence suggests that they are being masked within market neutral trades known as reverse conversions.

**How to hide your illegal married put: the** ***reverse conversion***\*\*!\*\*

Here is another example of naked selling for Overstock shares, now using a reverse conversion trade:

[ Example of a reverse conversion version of the married put for Overstock shares ](https://preview.redd.it/byyqzeqxz7q61.png?width=899&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8342600932db92cba6212ae04923218845d43b6)

Example of a reverse conversion version of the married put for Overstock shares

The addition of the the call sales masks the trade and attempts to hide it's illegality. However, a key point from the paper states that:

>Regulation SHO stocks with large, unsettled trades often exhibit a similar characteristic: ***“short selling” hedge funds with significant put holdings in 13F filings***

Now to take a look at Puts in GME using some other great ape DD.

**Options trading in GME**

We see a MASSIVE amount of PUTs sold for GME expiring on April 16: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfw3u4/huge\_number\_of\_puts\_expiring\_april\_16\_382k\_open/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfw3u4/huge_number_of_puts_expiring_april_16_382k_open/)

That is a possible 70% of hidden short interest that will expires in the options in a couple of weeks!!

Many of the PUT trades are likely to be the hedge funds' short positions from married puts. If they can expire worthless the hedge funds lose their bet and the MMs are left with a massive shit-ton of short sold IOUs to deal with.

If we look into all the put option interest for future months we might see the full scale of the married put naked shorting scam.

[u/Cuttingwater\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/Cuttingwater_/) took a look for me and found that if you tally up all puts <25$ (which just seem like write offs and would never be used) purchased for all available options dates, we are looking at > 150% of the float. That could be at least 150% of float sold naked! This number could be significantly higher as some options traded as part of the scam might have already expired.

208% if you include all puts OTM

In the case of the reverse conversion scam an extra call option is involved. For this version of the hidden naked short, the short hedgies are actually left with a way out of the money call. MAYBE THIS IS WHY WE SAW SUCH HIGH OPEN INTEREST FOR 800c CALLS IN RECENT WEEKS!!!

Every week we end around max pain we inflict more damage on the shorts: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mejp0k/the\_concept\_of\_max\_pain\_and\_why\_this\_is\_probably/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mejp0k/the_concept_of_max_pain_and_why_this_is_probably/)

Potentially the vast majority of options (both puts and calls) in GME could have been created as part of a naked shorting privilege scam. Therefore the longer we inflict max pain on the GME options, and the more patiently we HODL the more chance we have to ensure these fraudulent fucks are left with nothing.

All the recent DTCC filings suggest that they are covering their ass and looking into this bullshit before it explodes in their faces. Recent filings also mention that their aware of and ready to deal with option trading shenanigans by the MMs: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mecfwi/too\_ape\_didnt\_read\_sec\_filings\_part\_two\_fuck/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mecfwi/too_ape_didnt_read_sec_filings_part_two_fuck/)

**Conclusion**

GME short interest is likely hidden in the options using manipulative trades that illegally allow hedge funds to borrow market maker privileges and avoid paying large borrow fees. Every week that we allow options contracts to finish out of the money the illegal naked short trades become more unsustainable. DTCC filings show that they are scrambling to avoid holding the bag. A larger hand (or whale flipper?) seems to almost always set us down perfectly around the max pain each Friday to drain the shorts...

A storm is brewing around GME. I'm just gonna keep HODLin' and buyin' that dip.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit 1: What if the Dark Pools are largely being used for the married put trades. To sell naked shares directly to the shorts along with their puts!!!

Edit 2: [u/Cuttingwater\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/Cuttingwater_/) helped look into the options and found this:

>[@broccaaa](https://www.reddit.com/user/broccaaa) if you tally up all puts <25$ (which just seem like write offs and would never be used) purchased for all available options dates, we are looking at > 150% of the float  
208% if you include all puts OTM

I will add this to the main text. Could suggest that at least 150% is naked short sold. Other options as part of the scam could've already expired meaning this is a lower bound.

Edit 3: This also explains why SSR doesn't do much!! When MMs sell short to hedgies it 'washes' the short tag away. The hedges just have 'normal' phantom shares to dump at will!",2021-03-30 22:14:34

# Start reading here:

I am getting annoyed with all these ""*We can get 1-2 mil a share cause the dtcc has 60trillion bla bla bla*"" **This is not about the DTCC alone.**

All these Banks and Brokerages have insurances that cover **alot**. This is not about the US i am talking globaly. Even if the DTCC goes down there are still insurances that can cover in a crisis, Take Credit Suisse for example in Switzerland.

Now apply that for **every Bank and Brokerage** that is involved in GME.

There is **WAY more money for us to grab than 60Trillion**.We can demand 5mil -> they can cover.Same with 10, 20 ,50, 100mil .HELL EVEN 1 BILLION A SHARE. (*ceiling not floor*)

This is not just the US and DTCC. **THIS IS GLOBAL**, global Players, global Banks, global Brokerages.

Stop pinning a pricepoint on GME. We have to be realistic. Not everyone will hold. **THATS FINE**. Hell stop thinking these PaperHandBiotches will ruin anything the only thing they´ll ruin is their Ego when they sell at 10k 50k who knows. my 1 share will be worth more than 100 of theirs.

WE CAN STILL GET MILLIONS.

Stop thinking this is about the US **you damn Monkeys.**

Edit. I am sorry for screaming. I had to get this out. Thinking this is only about Citadel and the DTCC is so naive and annoys me. Stop thinking this is about your small world. Think About Asia and Europe. There is so goddamn much money and so many Banks involved. With all these new Rules coming in it is POSSIBLE to short a Company even After GME to over 100% but it will be SO MUCH MORE EXPENSIV. it wont happen again.

I hope to address some of the minor criticisms that were raised and use updated references for interested apes to look into.

**TLDR**: This post updates the possibility of a naked shorting scam with massive hidden FTDs and short interest in 2021. By looking at SEC rules and academic papers I show that rule changes do not stop the potential abuses of naked short selling in a material way. Rather they slightly modify how it could be done and optimized. The changes also make the scheme less sustainable on the short side and over time pressure might ""coil the spring"" and lead to an [unprecedented FTD squeeze](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/Current-DD/).

With current rules:

1. Synthetic shares can still be sold to hedge funds as part of a married put trade (or reverse conversion)
2. The borrowed privileges now only relate to the ""bona-fide"" market makers exemption from locate requirements
3. Rather than being able to flood the market with synthetics and let them build up indefinitely, once a security is on the threshold list market makers are forced to cover (after a certain time period)

If mass naked shorting and married put trades were being carried out in GME this could explain:

* the ""BUG"" bids as being part of ""bone-fide"" requirements to be ""regularly and continuously placing quotations \[..\] on both the bid and ask side of the market""
* short interest manipulation
* how naked short selling has become so widespread
* why borrow fees can still be so ridiculously low (low demand for located shares to borrow)
* that the vast majority of options (both puts and calls) might be due to naked short selling
* how short shares are 'washed' and able to be dumped on the market even during SSR
* why such a large number of way out of the money calls have been seen recently (actually part of a naked short trick, not long whales or gamma ramps)
* the vast number of trades in OTC / Dark Pools as part of married put trades

**Introduction**

The [post I wrote yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/) was based on an economics paper looking at naked short practices that abused options market maker privileges. The paper was written in 2007 and took Overstock shares as an example of of a stock with massive short share fuckery. Here is a great [Rolling Stone article](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/) showing court documents confirming the illegal short seller activity in Overstock. Despite the clear similarities with GME in 2021certain SEC rules have changed since the paper was written.

*Which short selling rules have changed and could a modified version of the scam be happening in 2021?*

With some help from other apes in the comments and a little extra research I'd like to clarify this and provide some thoughts on what might be going on today.

**SEC rules on short selling and the changes made up until 2006 (** **amendments to Regulation SHO under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 )**

Regulation SHO, which became fully effective on January 3, 2005, set forth a regulatory framework governing short sales. One of the goals of this was to target potentially abusive “naked” short selling practices in certain equity securities. Additional regulation was put in place to limit the selling of securities without first finding a valid share to borrow. The 2005 implementation failed miserably.

A [fantastic letter](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/s72303/sonecon010504.txt) was written in December 2003 by former Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Shapiro and forwarded to the SEC. In the letter Shapiro detailed findings from his own research and his doubts that the proposed changes in the SEC rules would have any material impact on the abusive practices:

>In my judgment, the proposed regulations would not significantly reduce short sale abuses.  To have a genuine impact on the efficiency and competitiveness of the  equity markets, the regulations should provide much stronger disincentives for naked short sales.  The integrity of the capital markets demands much stricter regulation than those currently proposed, much greater industry compliance than has occurred of late, and much tighter enforcement than has been seen thus far.

The [SEC allowed for two exceptions in their ruling](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2008/34-58775.pdf), the second of which was highlighted as the source of abuse in my previous post:

>As adopted in August 2004, Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO included two exceptions to the mandatory close-out requirement. The first was the “grandfather” provision, which excepted fails to deliver established prior to a security becoming a threshold security. ***The second was the “options market maker exception,” which excepted any fail to deliver in a threshold security resulting from short sales effected by a registered options market maker to establish or maintain a hedge on options positions that were created before the underlying security became a threshold security.***

Note that Rule 203(b)(3) of Regulation SHO relates to the close out requirements when large FTDs pile up. The exception that was in place up until 2008 allowed option market makers to completely ignore the closing of their position even in the presence of huge FTDs!!

The Commission noted that it would look for evidence for whether the options market maker exception for closing FTDs was operating significantly differently from their original expectations. Just a few years later the SEC realized their rules we're still being abused and started updating them again (also from [here](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2008/34-58775.pdf)):

>To the extent that fails to deliver might be part of manipulative “naked” short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company’s stock price, such fails to deliver may undermine the confidence of investors. These investors, in turn, may be reluctant to commit capital to an issuer they believe to be subject to such manipulative conduct. In addition, issuers  may believe that they have suffered unwarranted reputational damage due to investors’ negative perceptions regarding fails to deliver in the issuer’s security. Unwarranted reputational damage caused by fails to deliver might have an adverse impact on the security’s price...  
>  
>...With respect to the options market maker exception \[...\] we ***reproposed amendments to eliminate the exception***. In addition, the Commission sought comment on two alternative proposals that would require options market maker fails to deliver to be closed out within specific time-frames...  
>  
>...\[to achieve\] our goal of further reducing fails to deliver and addressing potentially abusive “naked” short selling, we believe that ***we must eliminate Regulation SHO’s options market maker exception***.

So after making new rules, then amending those rules, then looking at how well they worked, they realized the initial problem was not fixed.

Talk about taking your time to fix an issue that you acknowledge should be illegal and is highly detrimental to the market.

**Updated SEC rules for short selling in 2008**

A detailed and fairly easy to read description of the updated SEC rules in 2008 can be found [here](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2008/34-58775.pdf). It also has background info on previous rules.

Prior to updating the rules on options market maker FTD exceptions the SEC sought comment letters from interested parties:

>One commenter stated that it believes that the current options market maker exception “***harms investors and issuers, hinders the formation of capital, and is fatally flawed as written***” and that it should be eliminated. Another commenter stated that the options market maker exception “is a ***well known tool of manipulators*** ***and must be removed to ensure a level playing field for public companies and their shareholders***.” One commenter that supported the amendments noted that “***options market makers should factor the cost of borrowing stock and selling short into the price of the put options being sold***.” Commenters also stated that 13 consecutive settlement days was more than sufficient to close out a fail to deliver relating to an options position.

On the other side of the debate:

>Commenters who opposed the proposed amendments generally criticized the impact of elimination on options market making risk, quote depths, spread widths, and market liquidity in threshold securities and securities that might become threshold securities. Among other things, they stated that the options market maker exception is integral to the options market maker’s ability to make markets and manage risk and that, without the exception, making continuous markets would be very difficult, particularly in longer-dated options. One commenter suggested that “***withdrawing or greatly reducing the exception would cause varying losses of liquidity in over 20% of listed options and their underlying stocks***.”

Of course it would decrease liquidity if your ABILITY TO PRINT SYNTHETIC STOCKS AT WILL WERE REDUCED!!!

The other comments basically say that market makers would have a hard time guaranteeing that they make guaranteed profits. There is a balance here as market making serves a purpose, but this topic is about the reduction of widespread strategic FTD short selling that endangers the market.

After considering comments and data on FTDs the SEC stated that:

>We believe that it is ***appropriate to eliminate Regulation SHO’s options market maker exception*** because substantial levels of fails to deliver continue to persist in threshold securities and it appears that a significant number of these fails to deliver are as a result of the options market maker exception.

So the market maker exception for closing out FTDs was eliminated. Problem solved, right?

**Rules changed, problem fixed. WRONG!**

The elimination of the options market maker exception for closing out FTDs did help to reduce the number of FTDs in threshold securities (reference [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1386418112000171)). However market makers have additional privileges when it comes to naked short selling...

The ""bona-fide"" market making exception of locating shares before you sell them!!!

>Rule 203(b)(1) provides that ""\[a\] broker or dealer may not accept a short sale order in an equity security from another person, or effect a short sale in an equity security for its own account, unless the broker or dealer has: (i) Borrowed the security, or entered into a bona-fide arrangement to borrow the security; or (ii) Reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed so that it can be delivered on the date delivery is due; and (iii) Documented compliance with this paragraph (b)(1).” This is known as the “locate” requirement. ***Rule 203(b)(2)(iii) excepts market makers engaged in bona-fide market making activities from the locate requirement***.

So ""bona-fide"" market makers are exempt  from locating any shares before selling them. They don't even need to bother pretending they have a ""*reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed*"". They want to sell shares they don't have, no problem! As long as they're ""bona-fide"".

This means that ""bona-fide"" market makers can short sell stock with complete exception as part of their business. The privilege they lost in 2008 simply means that they cannot continue to hang onto the FTDs indefinitely with no intention of covering any more.

Furthermore we continue to have evidence of:

* [Additional naked short selling when it suits funds around earnings calls (2016)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2867383),
* [Continued short selling, fails-to-deliver, and abnormal returns (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S092753981630055X)

Did you really think they would give up the free money scheme *that* easily??

**What is a ""bona-fide"" market maker**

Seems like people don't really know. The SEC tried to clarify ([page 30](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2008/34-58775.pdf)) things as follows:

>The term “market maker” includes any specialist permitted to act as a dealer, any dealer acting in the capacity of a block positioner, and any dealer who, with respect to a security, holds itself out (by entering quotations in an inter-dealer quotation system or otherwise) as being willing to buy and sell such security for its own account on a regular or continuous basis.  
>  
>Moreover, as the Commission has stated previously, a market maker engaged in bona-fide market making is a “broker-dealer that deals on a regular basis with other broker-dealers, actively buying and selling the subject security **as** ***well as regularly and continuously placing quotations in a quotation medium on both the bid and ask side of the market***.”

Well that wasn't very fucking helpful. So they act as a dealer and deal with other dealers while actively buying and selling a security. Looks like a pretty low bar to be allowed to print synthetic shares outside of the normal rules.

Even [experts in the field](https://www.mmlawus.com/newsitem/pdf/joic-04-2017-0019_8757744610889.pdf) have a hard time understanding the definition:

>While there is still a lot of room for additional SEC guidance on what constitutes bona-fide market making, the SEC has provided some details on the specific type of trading that would not fall within the Regulation SHO exceptions applying to bona-fide market making activities. However, there is still a large gap between the type of activity that most likely falls within the exception and the concrete examples analyzed by the SEC.

WHY ARE ALL THE RULES AND DEFINITIONS SO UNCLEAR?!??

It must be by design. Who would think ""reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed"" provides clear guidance? Why is a ""bona-fide"" market maker so hard to describe yet they have exceptional privileges?

Some speculation. Let's look at the quote:

>as well as ***regularly and continuously placing quotations*** in a quotation medium ***on both the bid and ask side*** of the market

COULD THIS BE PART OF THE BUGS WE ARE SEEING WHERE THE BONE-FIDE PLAYERS NEED TO REVEAL THEIR POSITIONS?!?!

**The naked shorting scam updated for 2021**

We've seen that in the years since the method I described [yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgj0j1/the_naked_shorting_scam_revealed_lending_of/) was being used circa 2007 some rules have changed to reduce options market maker privileges. This is a summary of the changes:

* As of 2008 market maker exception for closing out FTDs was eliminated
* In 2021 ""bona-fide"" market makers are still exempt from locate requirements, allowing them to naked short sell their shares

How does this impact the scheme described previously?

1. Synthetic shares can still be sold to hedge funds as part of a married put trade (or reverse conversion)
2. The borrowed privileges now only relate to the ""bona-fide"" market makers exemption from locate requirements
3. Rather than being able to flood the market with synthetics and let them build up indefinitely, once a security is on the threshold list market makers are forced to cover

So the new rules do not change the potential scheme in any material way. There is now more risk on the market makers but if they can manage their FTDs they can keep trying to roll them over as before. Does this sound [familiar](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/og/GMEv13.pdf)?

[The FTD squeeze theory from https:\/\/iamnotafinancialadvisor.com\/Current-DD\/](https://preview.redd.it/v5zkyg2x4dq61.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0c48d441bb8cc46f497775a757dcb5e0c321c0c)

If a market maker were to manage their FTD deliverables using the above method, or something similar, then in effect they have side stepped the new rules and can delay delivering shares as before.

The difference with GME is that they NEVER prepared for a situation with this much attention and so many hungry apes. I implore you to read the [full PDF thesis about the FTD squeeze](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/og/GMEv13.pdf). Probably the best overview we have of GME and very much backs up how much rocket fuel is being pumped in as ""the springs coil tighter"".

**Conclusion**

Previous updates to SEC rules were shown to be  insufficient at reducing unwarranted naked short selling. The rule updates in 2008 eliminated the exemption that allowed market makers to never close FTDs for securities with high FTDs. Today ""bona-fide"" market makers still have a key privilege that lets them sell synthetic shares without the locate requirement. Naked short selling.

These changes do not eliminate the potential for naked shorting schemes being run by ""bona-fide"" market makers or in coordination with short hedge funds using the married put options play. If these methods were being widely used it would help to explain:

* how short interest has been manipulated in official reporting numbers
* how naked short selling has become so widespread
* why borrow fees can still be so ridiculously low (low demand for shorts that have been located)
* that the vast majority of options (both puts and calls) might be due to naked short selling
* how short shares are 'washed' and able to be dumped on the market even during SSR
* why such a large number of way out of the money calls have been seen recently (actually part of a naked short trick, not long whales or gamma ramps)
* the vast number of trades in OTC / Dark Pools as part of married put trades
* the ""BUG"" bids as being part of ""bone-fide"" requirements to be ""regularly and continuously placing quotations \[..\] on both the bid and ask side of the market""

This is one possible way in which the short interest is being hidden and the short shares being continuously sold, even when very hard to borrow on official channels. The rule changes do not prohibit such schemes, they would just need small modifications.

As the pressure builds it won't take much for the spring to sprung. Nothing has changed. I HODL!!

Based on other people making observations on oddly high trading volume occurring in XRT I decided to take a peak at other ETFs.  While you can see spikes everywhere I'll share the most bizarre example I've found.

Introducing: **SYLD**!

SYLD isn't particularly well known because it is a smaller ETF, under 3 million shares, containing a smaller amount of GME.  0.45% by weight, currently 4.71% by value.

Understand that ETFs in general are supposed to be sleepy investing tools.  A fund manager comes up with a concept, buys the shares, and sells the idea to the public.  In general ETFs are low volatility and aren't actively traded.

SYLD generally has a 5 minute trading volume in the low hundreds, occasionally it rises into the thousands.  Then crazy shit like this happens.

History of Gamestop hosting  its General Shareholders meeting: 
.

June 2, 2020


SEC law states that you can announce a share recall before the Annual General Meeting by 60 days. 

If Gamestop is hosting their AGM on June 10, 2021
They are allowed to announce a share recall on April 11, 2021 (Which is a sunday, so it will most likely be announced on Monday, April 12, 2021) 

What a coincidence, the legend DFV has 500 Calls that expire that week (Friday, April 16)!!!!

That glorious  DFV... timing his call after the April 10 earliest date of share recalls....

What about the shares recall? 
When they announce a share recall, they give you a deadline to register

Last year, they recalled the shares on April 10, and the deadline for registry was April 20

It is necessary to recall the shares prior to the meeting by 60 days in order to vote. That means if the total ownership of gamestop exceeds the number of shares existed, the shorters MUST close their positions before the registery deadline! 

April 12 might not be the day they announce the share recall, but it will happen in April. It MUST happen in order to have the annual general shareholder meeting. 

Dont put your hopes on certain dates, I'm just betting on a share recall on april based on the history of data. 
Huge news are brought up during the annual shareholders meeting and we get to participate and vote on important changes (Example: Change of CEO *Wink Wink*) Again, just an example.


See you all at the diamond hands meeting 💎🖐🏼 Please spread the word and make this post more visible.





                 🖍Answering your questions: 🖍

1)What is AGM? 
Annual General Meeting



2) Why must they cover if they recall the share? 

Simply because the ownership of the stock exceeds the number of shares issued by a company. Example: Apes and institution are holding 250 million shares. Only 70 Million exist. They must buy back the synthetic shares they issued and flooded the market with. We determine the price. 

3) Why didnt this happen last year tho? 

The ownership of the stock did not exceed the number of shares issued from the company. Apes and institutions were not interested in GME.


4)What if I own 1 Share? 

Know your rights as a shareholder.   Mark cuban wrote this article on shareholders rights. Even if you own 1 share, you must register once they announce the share recall. Every share matters.

Anyone wanting to read the Mark Cuban blog post, here's a link:

https://blogmaverick.com/2006/04/26/dont-blame-me-im-just-a-stupid-shareholder/amp/?__twitter_impression=true



5) Can you cite a source for the SEC Law recall 60 days?


Sure!

1.5 Notice. The Corporation shall give written or electronic notice of each shareholders’ meeting stating the date, time, and place and, for a special meeting, the purpose(s) for which the meeting is called, not less than ten (10) (unless a greater period of notice is required by law in a particular case) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of the meeting, to each shareholder of record, to the shareholder’s address as it appears on the current record of shareholders of the Corporation.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789019/000119312516641678/d219877dex32.htm

I Used Microsofts SEC filing as reference, although the rules still apply to all companies. I will try finding GMEs filing from last year and will update you if I find anything specific.


Once a company announces the shareholders meeting, they will provide shareholders with a deadline to register. That is how a stock is recalled. Thus, this section of the article has 100% to do with a share count.


6) Why is it called texas law? That has nothing to do with SEC...


SEC Fort Worth Regional Office is located in Texas. The SEC has more than 10 branches. This particular law has been issued by the SEC branch of texas. SEC laws apply to all companies that are traded publicly in the United states. I just used the microsoft filing as reference. It is reffered to as the texas law due to the law being issue from the SEC Fort Worth Regional Office.

7) IMPORTANT NOTE: 

Not all platforms allow you to participate in voting. 

Etoro is one of those platforms where they do the voting on your behalf.


8) Right, so if  understand this correctly, last year some major shareholders opted out, plus there were not as many fake shares, so a recall/count didn't happen?This year, some of those shareholders (Blackrock) might well want a recall, as well as Retail. That alone might be enough to force shorts to close shares? If so, the next question is, how many of us actually own the shares we think we own? 


Do the various dodgy brokers we are forced to operate through actually assign proper ownership of the shares when we buy them? 

Answer: Yes. Most of the platforms you guys are using are regulated. If they risk breaking such rules they're facing major Lawsuits and being delisted as regulated broker. If the broker you are using is regulated by top teir financial sector, you shouldnt worry. 


9) I would assume a lot of these shares we own are synthetics that need to be covered. Do these synthetics have an associated issuance identifier that matches the real share, wherever the hell that is actually living, presumably in Kens asshole?

Answer: That is not your problem. These assholes flooded the market with synthetic shares? Then they must buy it back before the deadline for the shares recall. Or else they are most likely headed to prison. A share recall is a good identifier to prove our theory of Hedgefunds flooding the market with synthetic shares. They MUST buy it back. Thats why a lot of people are mentioning 1 Million is not a meme, 10M is not a meme, etc. Because YOU set the floor for your shares.



10) How do you register/vote? Is it through your platform? I’m sure there will be more posts as the date approaches, but I personally have no idea how to participate.


Once Gamestop announces the Annual Shareholders Meeting, your brokers duty is to report the number of shares their users have purchased. Then, your broker will email you your voting right if they allow their users to participate in voting. Ask your broker if they allow you to vote, as I have mentioned not all brokers allow their users to vote and vote on their behalf (Example:Etoro) 

A broker can not fake the number of shares their users have purchased, unless you have purchased a CFD share (Contract for difference). Again, you shouldnt worry about your share being real/synthetic. Those that flooded the market with synthetic shares are the ones fucked, not you.



u/the_captain_slog mentioned 

""Even if you recall your shares, there is no guarantee that your broker will locate them in time and you will be given voting rights equal to your ownership interest.

Many brokers follow what is known as post-reconciliation procedures. You'll get a proxy statement from them that says you own 100 shares, for example. They own your shares in street name, so they vote on your behalf - you are just instructing them how to vote for you. They add your shares and votes to the other holders of the stock and ship them all in. If the DTCC says, hey, you did 10,000 votes and should've only had 5,000, they will ""reconcile"" (remove) the extra votes. This is a process known as ""over-voting.""  You will never be notified if your shares are not voted. https://katten.com/Proxy-Vote-Processing-Issues

An SEC roundtable in 2018 showed that out of 183 shareholder meetings studied, 130 had over-votes. https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2018/11/21/what-happened-at-the-secs-proxy-process-roundtable/

Here's a pretty good overview of the general proxy voting process: https://www.niri.org/getattachment/Professional-Development/Webinars/Archived-Webinars/Proxy-Voting-101/NIRI-Webinar-Proxy-Voting-101-021518.pdf



Also, one nit - GME is incorporated under Delaware law (like a lot of corporations) so they'd be following those rules and not Texas."" 

Reply: Gamestop is headquartered in Texas. The SEC 60 days notice for recalling shares applies to *All*  SEC branches and *All* publicly traded companies in the US. A rule that applies to Apple still applies to Gamestop and every other company listed on the NYSE (NewYork Stock Exchange) 



                      🖍Final Thoughts🖍

Knowledge is power. I tried my best to explain the situation in the easiest wording I can. Ignore any typos/grammar mistakes (english is my second language). Feel free to correct me on any information I posted that is wrong, I will edit the post and fix it. We're all trying to learn here! Thank you for the awards and upvotes! An ape with diamond hands and knowledge is indestructible 🦍💎🖐🏼🖍🖍


Also, DFV is a fucking genius. The way he timed his calls expiration is mind blowing. I don't understand how his brain functions but that brilliant bstard is a fucking genius. Im jacked to the titz. Mind blown.

DFV 500 calls - strike $12 - exp: *4/16/2021*

On a side note, if you ordered the SQUEEZEable plush kitty banana, its expected date of delivery is *4/20/21* 


Final Edit: 
This is not an ""IF this happens"" situation. This is a ""WHEN this happens"". Im not betting on a conspiracy theory, Im simply waiting to hear from Gamestop, and we are GUARANTEED to have an annual shareholders meeting. We WILL hear from gamestop.


Example of a company recalling their shares: 
 
Tesla (Which was a long-short squeeze) recalls their shares every July, their AGM is in september.  See a trend here?

GME's Annual General Meeting- Mid July 
Soonest we can hear from them - Mid Ape-ril

Last Wednesday's chart was a beautiful mountain of tug of war.  This is (regardless of my financial interests) the most INTERESTING episode, possibly in the entirety of economic history.

Even though it feels tinfoil hat and confirmation bias as hell, last Friday's tweet from Game Stop with the picture of a CONTROLLER and a total of $250+15 indicated on it, and a closing share price of $264.50, the messaging of ""Buy now Eat later""  I just have a really really really hard time thinking of that as a coincidence.  Logically it either MUST be coincidence or intentional.  I think the message we are getting is clear, ""we are in control, don't worry, buy now, feast later, we got you""

This isn't from the viking, or Elon, or even RC, this is from GameStop itself, which I think is critical.  A lot of people have been asking for weeks/months ""What if the company issues more shares?  What if they cut a deal with the HFs?  What if they do a weird split, vote the wrong way etc...what if they screw us???""

Here is why I think Game Stop, and Ryan Cohen are 100000% on our side, and it's pretty freaking simple.  Right now there are billions of dollars that are locked up in HF bank accounts, and other holdings, that Game Stop will never ever ever see.  They won't see it as investment, and they won't see it as income.  In fact, if it weren't for the current squeeze situation, if GME did a secondary offering, do you think anybody on the street would be buying in?  Maybe now with RC, but not if the old guard had their way.

However...WHEN the squeeze is over with, those billions will be in OUR hands.  We will KNOW that RC and Game Stop wanted that to happen, made sure it would happen and that is going to create the WEALTHIEST MOST LOYAL FANBASE OF ANY RETAILER ON THE PLANET.  Seriously, can you think of ANY retailer in any market that has that MANY rabidly loyal, dedicated, and wealthy customers?  How many of us have already pledged to spend hundreds of thousands at GME after the squeeze is squoze just to buy stuff to donate to needy kids or hospitals.  How many of us will want to be building tricked out gamer dens, top end PC rigs, filling out libraries of AAA titles etc...

Right now, cost is unfortunately more of a concern for me than brand loyalty, but there are companies that I am loyal to that I will ALWAYS buy from if they can compete on price.  If money is no longer an object because the squeeze was squoze, I can tell you with some certainty, if Game Stop sells something I want, it will be the only place I will buy those things for the rest of my life.  Ryan Cohen knows this, I think he's banking on it.

That's just from the profit side.  Let's look at the investment side.  Once the squeeze is squoze and the price settles down to a fair market valuation (I'm thinking around $1400) and I've gotten out my squeeze profits I am going STRAIGHT back in as a long, for all the reasons I stated above, as well as RC's vision for the company in general.  Moreover, if the board says ""You know, how about we do a secondary offering of 10 million shares at 1k a piece"" I as a shareholder will be THRILLED.  I'm not worried about dilution of 10 million shares added to the pool when that will put 10 billion into the company coffers.  10 billion could buy a lot of forward thinking investment.  I WILL be a long shareholder after the squeeze is squoze because Game Stop is going to absolutely dominate the gaming space with an army of loyal, wealthy shareholders who want it to succeed.

TLDR; RC and Game Stop want the squeeze to be squoze because it's going to turn is into a legion of money slinging GME supporting super apes who will also happily own stock in the company for the long haul.  Not worried about them cutting a deal or offering stock in any way that would prevent that from happening.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  Edited to note that the coordination is on the HFs side.  I see the longs fighting, but I don't see coordination.  I just like the stock.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:  WOW!  Thank you all so much for the response.  I think this is important for very Ape to understand and the response to this post is more proof positive that GME is going to have fans in a way that no other retail ever will.  Stay strong my ape brothers and sisters, this is history I'm happy to be on the right side of.

DFV has lost money holding onto his 4/16 call options, rather than sell the contracts and just buy the equivalent shares over the past several months.  Sure, he paid $1k total for these options and they’re now worth millions, but he has missed out on EVEN MORE gains by continuing to hold them.  The objective of this post is to take a moment to consider what this might tell us. 

(Skip this paragraph if you already understand options contracts)

An option is a contract which gives the owner the option (but not an obligation) to purchase, or sell 100 shares at a set price called the strike, for a limited amount of time, at which point they expire - and these options can be traded on the open market between investors prior to expiry.  I’m not going to make this unnecessarily long by explaining everything there is to know about stock options, I’ll instead get straight to the most relevant things you need to know to follow along.  DFV aka roaring kitty aka Keith Gill, is the brilliant legend that gifted reddit with the knowledge and proof that Gamestop is a great investment, who owns 100,000 shares.  He also owns (500) $12 strike call options that expire on 4/16, giving him the option to purchase a total of 50,000 shares for $12 each prior to that date.  As each share of GME is substantially higher than the strike price, these calls are considered very deep ‘in the money’ (ITM) as their intrinsic value is GME current share price $181 minus $12 strike price = $169 gross profit per share x100 shares (not including the cost of the option contract itself) - so they are indeed quite valuable.  However, as all options contracts expire, they also have ‘extrinsic’ value, which is basically a combination of how volatile the stock is, and how much time is left before expiration.  This portion of options valuation is quite literally the embodiment of the phrase “time is money”.  Even though the option contracts he owns are extremely valuable, and rise (and fall) exponentially in lock-step with GME stock price movement - he is losing money every single day due to ‘theta’, one of the many metrics used to assess the value of an option - and he’s letting that happen on purpose, which is obviously not a great trading strategy.  

Ok, so now everyone knows who DFV is and what he’s holding.  At any point in time, he could exercise his call options and purchase the shares for $12 each - however in doing so, he destroys the extrinsic value of the options.  With a stock as volatile as GME - lets just keep this high level and say that theta (time) is quite valuable.  He has had countless opportunities to sell these call options at peaks, and use the massive proceeds from the sales to purchase tens of thousands of shares with the proceeds - essentially increasing the amount of shares he holds, for free.  I don’t understand why this hasn’t been a widely discussed topic.

All we know for certain: he is not a cat, he is quite smart, and he really likes this stock.  So it is my belief that his decision to hang onto these call options is very much intentional, and tips his hand as to what he believes is to come.  

We all know what happened the week of the great Robinhood robbery, 1/28.  As confirmed multiple times by Tom Peterffy (Interactive Brokers) as said on national tv that all hell was about to break loose before brokers nerfed the ‘buy’ button to aid short participants in tanking the stock.

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Yq4jdShG_PU

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_TPYuIRVfew

If you pay careful attention to what he was saying: the sheer volume of call options that became ITM would have commanded the tranfer of far more shares than could actually be delivered.  No one is letting an ITM option expire worthless, they would be sold to close by the investor or broker, or pay to exercise and have the shares assigned - but regardless, shares far exceeding the amount that actually exist would have had to change hands.  This alone could cause an infinite money glitch.  Sprinkle in the high short interest (borrowed shares, which at the time was listed as 140% of the available amount of shares) on top and well, he’s right - the result would be a massive systemic event.  But the call options alone had the power to tip the first domino - and they damn near did.  

We are now seeing increased restrictions for call writing (selling / creating call options).  Those publishing DD on the crazy volume and unusual activity we’re seeing in the options market confirm that there are very powerful forces participating in options trading of GME.  As an effect of low liquidity due to an army of apes buying and holding, this options activity appears to be what’s behind the wheel of the stock price.  When lots of calls are going ITM - market makers need to buy more shares to have on hand so they’re ready to change hands, which drives the price up.  That’s what happened at the end of January.  To combat this, shorts / 🌈🐻 buy lots of put options, which has the opposite effect.  This appears to be a tug of war, and the force of those tugs is amplified by low liquidity made possible by you fine apes simply holding. 

So, we know the biggest squeeze to ever occur was primed to blow based on an absurd amount call options going ITM.  If I’m not mistaken - every single option in the chain expiring the week prior to the great robbery - were ITM upon expiry - which due to the MM implications described above, slingshotted the price up.  That would have happened again the week of the 28th had vlad and his 🌈🐻 friends not cheated to save their own ass, but GME would have surely reached escape velocity as a result and the shorts would have gone tits up, triggering the MOASS.  This effect of MM’s acquiring shares to hedge against these ITM calls is referred to a ‘gamma squeeze’, again, which I’m not going to get into further detail on, and it is well documented on the googles - but it was the call options that were the orange legendary weapon that would have been all that was needed to beat the game.  And DFV has fucking 500 of them.  

So the squeeze could be triggered by lots of things at this point - a hedgefund short on GME running out of money to fight their losing war, the SEC stepping in to address absurd level of FTDs or change the rules on short interest reporting or even bringing up charges on one of these bad market participants like Citadel (not holding my breath for them though), the DTCC / NSCC stepping in demanding SLD’s to hedge these risky plays (this seems likely), or even just news coming out that gets retail to fomo and pile back in - the gamma squeeze is the only sure fire way to make this go interstellar and it requires no outside influences.  It almost caused the whole thing to melt down already, and it very well may happen again.

So, with all this in mind: Why the fuck is DFV still holding these options?  He’s clearly got enough money from profits taken earlier to exercise these $12 call options as it would only cost him $600k to do so, and he shows $10m in cash right there on his yolo update spreadsheet.  He likes the stock so much he just bought 50,000 more shares following the first congressional hearing (to make it the cool 100k shares he has now total) - where it seems extremely unlikely he would just take profits from these calls instead of continuing to add to his position. 

DFV is being sued by hedgefunds who shorted GME and claimed he manipulated the market (LOL @ butthurt 🌈🐻) - so maybe that has affected his available choices.  If his intention was to sell these calls for profit, it’s possible he was advised not to by his council, as that could potentially be used as part of the claim against him in court that he manipulated the stock for personal profit (again, lol). 

So he has consciously held these calls instead of cashing them out, instead of selling them and using the proceeds to buy more stock, instead of exercising them to be assigned the shares - and he’s consciously decided to do this despite leaving (mind you I’m too dumb to calculate a $ amount but by all means, feel free fellow wrinkled brains) a CONSIDERABLE amount of money on the table.  Now why the fuck would someone as smart as he clearly is - see a million bucks or more on the ground and not pick it up?

Maybe it’s because there’s a bigger picture we’re not seeing, that he is.  Maybe the opportunity for another nuclear gamma squeeze presents itself before 4/16 expiration - and he can exercise these call options at the most critical moment to exert maximum impact.  In video game terms: these call options are his special.  Super.  Ult.  Maybe even Fatality.  

But also maybe these could represent a revive spell.  Elixir.  Phoenix dust, if things take another wild turn for the worst.

Exercising and getting those shares demanded for delivery at a time of ultimate inconvenience of the market makers & shorts is a 1-2 punch.  Not only does this put mm’s on the hook for delivering the shares (obviously) which is impactful, however small in the big picture - but maybe even more importantly it serves to act as inspiration to those who get inspired by his yolo updates.  If you don’t think him posting an update that shows he bought another 50,000 shares won’t be impactful, you’re living under a rock.  

Tldr; I believe he may have chosen to hold these calls in order to use either use them to help push a rally over the top - or as a defensive special power like a baptiste immortality field to spark a reversal should things start going south.   He is doing this purposefully, despite significant monetary loss, and he really fucking wants the world to know it.  

This is not investment advice, i eat crayons etc etc - but I feel it is important to open up a dialogue about the clues he has offered up, and what they alone might tell us about his motivations, and convictions in just how much he likes this stock.

PS- dfv if you’re reading this, I feel so bad for you buddy.  With this whole ordeal literally rewriting history, this must easily be the most exciting thing to happen (or one of, I dont know if you have kids) in your entire life by playing a role in it.  Seeing your vision of there being deep value in Gamestop play out to be true, against all likelihood, against those who doubted and ridiculed you, and against the wishes of extremely powerful forces who once stood to materially benefit immensely - has got to be totally surreal.  By simply identifying a really solid investment opportunity - you have whether intentionally or not - done more to bring the whole world together - people of all walks of life, during a moment in time the world couldnt be more divided and contentous.  I can’t understate how incredible this is to witness.  However, not being able to talk about it as a result of the law suit, and deservingly pound your fuckin chest like the stud silverback you are - has got to be torturous, with all you’re able to do is drop a yolo update here and there and giving out anonymous awards.  Just know that I see you bro.  We see you.  I really hope some day after books are written and statues sculpted in your honor - that I could buy you a pint and share a laugh on andromeda.

You are so excited you're shivering cause you knew this moment had to come. You start reading the DDs and comments on Reddit, many apes are scared that ""some people will sell and f* up the rocket"" then you quickly check the price, 900, 800, 700... you check Reddit and read comments like ""some paper hands piece of shills are selling"", you start believing it, you check the price once again and... 500, 400, 300. You sell some shares out of desperation. 200, 100, 50. You contributed to have f*ed up the rocket, you sell all of your shares and officially become a paper handed bish, you will never have an opportunity like this ever again, your family will never see that helpful money, you will have to work for the rest of your life and finally die poor. 

Nice story, ah?

Now, let me tell you the other side of this story...

You wake up, do your stuff, go to work, get busy. You look at the price every second, 200, 500, 1000. You  knew this moment had to come but you're ready, you're being paid to be ready. You start reading the DDs and comments on Reddit, you and your colleagues start commenting stuff like ""some people will sell and f* up the rocket"", you and your colleagues sell thousands of shares, you quickly check the price, 900, 800, 700... you're not stressed, everything is going the way you hoped, you and your colleagues go to Reddit and post comments like ""some paper hands piece of shills are selling"", you and your colleagues sell thousands of shares, you wait some time for apes to start believing those comments, you check the price once again and... 500, 400, 300. You and your colleagues sell thousands of shares, you hope apes will give up and sell some shares out of desperation. 200, 100, 50. You know it worked, you contributed to have f*ed up the rocket, you couldn't be more proud of yourself, apes are selling all of their shares and officially become paper handed bishes. Your work day has ended, you congratulate with your colleagues and get the money, you are happy you destroyed the dreams and lives of millions of people who wanted to make the world a better place. You exit the Citadel building knowing millions of people are now crying cause of you.

^ That's... The other side of the story.



They will try to convince you that some are selling, that they'll stop the rocket. THEY WILL SELL THOUSANDS OF SHARES TO BRING THE PRICE DOWN. How much down? 0 is and has always been their target.

It's not a matter of time, it's a matter of strength. At one point you'll believe some paper hands are selling, at some point you'll question yourself why didn't you sell before...

The key is to have faith in the good which is intrinsic in the apes, no matter if you think some apes will sell, faith is faith. You're not reaching a destination, you're just moving towards it, you gotta be water to reshape yourself and dodge the FUD, FOMO and other techniques we don't even know about.

Hi Fellow Apes,

I was going through the open interest (IO) on puts and calls for April and I found a serious outlier with April 16th! While this is a 'monthly' options date and therefore has been avaialbe for a while, it still has a significant number of puts between $175 and $25 (20% of all puts for that date), more than any of the other long term dates.

Below we will go through the huge volume of puts and what this potentially means through complete speculation.

&#x200B;

**----------** **BOILERPLATE:**

I still know nothing, I can't do math good. PLEASE don't listen to me! Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀

**There is a MASSIVE number of Puts in Open Interest for April 16 (the same week as DFV's call options), equivalent to 70% of the float. This is a 'monthly' options date so the shorts probably filled these up before the Jan squeeze when they thought they could bankrupt GME. Either way, you can see they are really hoping for this 🚀 to abort launch haha.**

&#x200B;

**---------- Options: Definitions**

Just to make sure everyone knows what we are talking about. I am just going to do a VERY quick summary of Puts / Calls including Volume, Open Interest, in the money (ITM) and out of the money (OTM). Just scroll to the next section if you are familiar with all the terms.

&#x200B;

**Call Option:**

>A call is an option contract giving the **owner the right, but not the obligation**, **to buy** a specified amount of an underlying security at a **specified price** within a **specified time**.  
>  
>Call options **increase in value** as the stock **increases in price**

&#x200B;

**Put Option:**

>Put options give holders of the **option the right, but not the obligation, to sell** a specified amount of an underlying security at a specified price within a specified time frame.  
>  
>Put options **increase in value** as the stock **falls in price**

&#x200B;

**In the Money (ITM):**

>ITM indicates that an option has value in a strike price that is favorable in comparison to current price of the stock:  
>  
>An in-the-money ***call*** **option** means the option holder has the opportunity to **buy the security below its current market price**.  
>  
>An in-the-money ***put*** **option** means the option holder can **sell the security above its current market price.**

&#x200B;

**Out of the Money:**

>OTM indicates that the option has no current value since the strike price is unfavorable in comparison to the current price of the stock:  
>  
>An OTM **call option** has a **strike price** that is **higher** than the **current market price.**  
>  
>An OTM **put option** has a **strike price** that is **lower** than the **current market price**.

&#x200B;

**Price of Options:**

>The specified price for all options is known as the **strike price** and the specified time during which a sale is made is its **expiration or time to maturity**.  
>  
>When you see the price for a call or put, that is the price per share but options are usually sold in lots of 100 shares, therefore the price to buy the option is actually X \* 100. Also this means if you want to calculate the number of equivalent shares at an option price

&#x200B;

**Volume:**

>Volume refers to the number of trades completed each day. Each transaction—regardless of whether it's an opening or closing transaction—counts toward the daily volume.

&#x200B;

**Open Interest:**

>Total number of outstanding contracts that have not yet been settled. Even if there is volume during a day, but the total number of contracts does not change, then the OI will stay the same.  Open interest decreases when buyers (or holders) and sellers (or writers) of contracts close out more positions than were opened that day.

&#x200B;

**---------- April Options:**

Now that everyone is up to speed on options, lets take a look at the options for April. Please note that looking at options is always a snapshot in time since the number will change minute to minute. This snapshot was from \~11 am March 29, 2021:

Data was taken from [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1619740800&p=GME&straddle=true](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?date=1619740800&p=GME&straddle=true)

**Update:** Added a puts under $1 row

https://preview.redd.it/80rsfynl61q61.png?width=1476&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f8dd0bb91f60df2153b470c4ad93d0ed6963b8

Right away, you can see that April 16 is an extreme outlier. **There is 7x more put contracts in OI for April 16 than this week.**

To normalize the data, I also looked at total call options currently OTM for each week and while the puts are fairly in line with calls for weeks of April 1, 9, 23 and 30th (1.5-2.5x call options), **April 16 continues to be an outlier** with over **3.5x the put options in IO than call options.**

Put options only become valuable if the price of the stock goes below the strike price, **therefore someone is expecting the price to plummet (or want to make the price plummet) by April 16.**

For fun, I calculated the **cost of all the Puts IO** using current price (which I know is not how much it actually cost since the prices change all the time and drastically so, but whatever its still fun to do) brings us to approximately **$50,000,000.** That's a decent chunk of change to spend on betting the price will drop.

\---------- **Update: Future Options dates and Tesla**

As suggested in the comments, I looked at all the long term options dates and we also see some seriously high put options purchased at the July and January 2021 expiry dates. I also added a row to show % of puts at a price of $1 or below.

Only 4% of puts were purchased for Jan 2022 are for strike prices >$25, July it is 9% and April 16 is 20%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/afuqhz2p61q61.png?width=1702&format=png&auto=webp&s=d16f53034d969403c71f223be73eb58da148a087

I also look into this for **Tesla**, just as a comparison to see what size of the float do we see on all future options. I choose the **three future dates with the largest number of options** currently IO

&#x200B;

[Tesla](https://preview.redd.it/7k9aziv712q61.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5ab752c327ace121ea827b4561ac2319b287d55)

You can see that there are **WAY fewer options being purchased with the % of float maxing out at 7.6%, but call volume is also in line with puts, unlike with GME.** And this is also a stock that is also seen some crazy volatile recently!

&#x200B;

**---------- What are they planning?**

To me this could signify a few things - from most to least likely (and would love to hear other people's theories):

1. **Update:** These put options were purchased back before the initial squeeze by the shorts hoping that they were going to bankrupt the stock before this time and make even more money on the drop. 2/3 of the puts are for a strike price below $25
2. The are **building up their stock of puts** to try and bring the price of the stock down and make money on it when they do.
3. After seeing DFV's calls at this date, they are directly betting against him by purchasing huge amounts of cheap puts (unlikely)
4. They calculated that the squeeze will happen before this date and **expect the price to drop back down by this time**, hopefully recouping a bit of their losses. (very unlikely)

Either way, if you add up all OTM puts between now and April 16, it represents **90% of the entire float!**

Should we prepare for craziness on that week? **probably not but this could become a self fulfilling prophecy so who knows!**

I think if we don't see them try to refill this hopper after April 16, it will be quite telling that they are running out of steam.

&#x200B;

**---------- TLDR:**

**There is a MASSIVE number of Puts in Open Interest for April 16 (the same week as DFV's call options), equivalent to 70% of the float. This is a 'monthly' options date so the shorts probably filled these up before the Jan squeeze when they thought they could bankrupt GME. Either way, you can see they are really hoping for this 🚀 to abort launch haha.**

for those that want the raw numbers: a reminder that its the Open Interest that we care about, not the volume:

After reading this post it made me wonder what the daily short volume has been on these ETF's that contain GME over the last few months. We already know that XRT was shorted to over 800% at it's peak, and is now currently sitting at a short interest of about [197%](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=xrt&submit=Short+Quote%E2%84%A2) which is obviously super sus.


I managed to find [63 different ETF's](https://www.etf.com/stock/GME
) that all contain GME (not sure if this is a 100% complete list of ETF's containing GME) and I used [Shortvolume.com](https://www.shortvolume.com/?t=GOOG) to go through [each individual one](https://imgur.com/a/EeCy6jo) and run their daily short volume for the last 1 month as well as the last 3 months and seen some interesting trends in some of these ETF's. I was hoping that someone with a few more wrinkles in their brain would be able to take a quick gander at these charts and offer some insight. I am fairly new to all of this and would really like to hear some insights from people more knowledgeable than myself.


A few things I found interesting, a lot of the spikes in short volume happened around the same time the short interest in GME itself dropped, and the volumes were massively higher than a typical day for these ETF's on specific days over the last 3 months 


A couple of ETF's stood out in particular, XRT being one but this has been gone through in length in the DD I linked above, but I have not seen any information regarding the following ETFs


* XSVM - looking at the 3 month chart will show that this ETF was heavily shorted back in December, to a point where it was almost 100% of the total daily volume in mid December


* VIOV - Looking at the 3 month chart will show a massive spike in trading volume in early January where the short volume was over 90%, as well as a few days in mid December where the short volume was over 90% of the total daily volume


* RWJ - 3 month chart shows a few days again with massive short volume around the 21st of January, as well as a few days in late January - early February where the volume went up significantly, but the majority of it not being short volume


* VIOG - 1 month chart shows a massive spike in volume on February 9th where over 90% of the volume was short and the rest of the week showing lower volume but with the majority of it being short. The 3 month chart shows mid to late December having days where the short volume was over 80% of the daily volume


* VTWV - 1 month chart shows fluctuating short volume with days over 80% of total volume being short. 3 month chart shows a couple of days around December 20th with massive volume where damn near 100% of it is short volume


* VCR - 1 month chart shows a peak volume day of February 3rd with the daily short volume making up 90% of the total volume. The 3 month chart shows it averaging about 60-80% daily short volume in December


* IUSS - 3 month chart shows 3 days with massive spikes in volume with little to no short interest, but the days preceding and following shows a yoyo chart of short interest jumping up then down up then down, some days being nearly 100% of the total daily volume 


* VTWO - 3 month chart shows massive spikes in daily short volumes in early Feb, mid to late Jan and Early Jan. One day in early Jan/late Dec shows a massive spike in volume up to almost 2.2 million shares with nearly 100% of the volume being short.


* EWSC - Another one with a yo-yoing short volume effects, * bouncing as low as almost 0% to as high as almost 100%, over and over


* PSCD - more massively yo-yoing short volume


* SFYF - massively yo-yoing short volume, with quite a few days over 90%


* SYLD - massive spike in volume around the end of Jan, nearly 100% of the volume short


* RALS - really have no idea what's going on here, shows pretty much no volume with no short volume but 1 day in Feb and 1 day in Jan with large spikes in volume


* FNDB - large spike in volume at the end of Dec, 90% or more of it being short


* VBR - Massive spike in volume at the end of Jan, over 90% of it short. Average short volume 60%-80% over the last 3 months


* IJS - massive spike in volume around Jan 21st, over 90% of it short


* NUSC - massive spikes in volume in mid and late Jan, short volume over the last 3 months consistently between 60%-90%


* SLYV - massive spikes in volume multiple times over the last month, with the largest spike having over 90% short volume


* SPSM - massive spike in volume on Jan 26th, 90% of it short


* SLY - massive spike in volume on Feb 9th, almost 100% of it short


* FLQS - massive spike in volume on Jan 25th, short volume fluctuating back and forth between 0% and 100%


* IJT - massive spike in volume around Jan 21st, over 90% short volume, another massive spike early to mid Feb, 80% short


* GSSC - massive spike in volume on Feb 19th, almost 100% short


* SLYG -  large spikes as well around Jan 21st and today, short volume over 70%


* VXF - been averaging about 60% or more daily short volume for the last 3 months


* NVQ - massive spike in volume in early Jan, daily short volume fluctuating up and down with the daily short volume being up to almost 100% on and off


* VB - massive spike in volume end of Jan, over 90% of the volume short, averaging almost 70% short over the last 3 months


* SAA - massive spikes in volume today and end of Jan, short volume constantly fluctuating between 20% and 90%


* BBSC - Massive spike in volume around Feb 7th, almost 100% short


* OMFS - massive spike in volume around Feb 6th being 100% short, then another large spike on Feb 16th being 0% short. Daily short volume fluctuating between 0%-90% and 100%


* STSB - massive spike in volume around Feb 6th, 100% of it short volume


* SSLY - large spike in short volume on Feb 1st and a massive one on the 2nd, 100% of the volume being short


* SCHA - massive spike in volume end of Jan, 90% short volume


* PBSM - 3 month chart shows this ETF being shorted all day everyday averaging between 70%-100% short constantly throughout the last 3 months, massive spikes in volume end of Jan and early Feb


* UWM - most low volume with low short percentages, averaging around 100k shares or so in volume a day, but in early December the was at least 1 day where the volume spiked to over 4 million shares, with almost 100% of it being short


* VTHR - massive spikes in volume in Dec with the short volume being 90%-100%


* TILT - massive spike in volume on Feb 2nd, almost 90% of it short. last 3 days the daily short volume has been 90% of the total volume


* SPDR - Jan 28th there was a massive spike in volume, nearly 100% of it was short. 3 month chart shows the daily short volume bouncing between 10% and 100%


* HDG - same as above, massive spike on Jan 28th with 100% of the volume short, 3 month chart shows it bouncing between 10% short volume and 100%


* AVUS - 3 month chart shows this average daily short volume bouncing between 80% short and 100%, up and down up and down


* DFAU - averaging between 70% short and 100% short almost daily

DOGE TO THE MOON!!!!,2021-05-05 06:22:54,792,Why the updated ATM offering is an absolute MASTERSTROKE and I'm more confident than ever that RC and Game Stop WANT the squeeze to happen!,1617656955.0,"What a weekend, what a wake up!  I like everyone else woke up to some fancy price action and dug in to find out that Game Stop (remember, without the booted CFO) filed with the SEC to update their previous filing regarding their ATM offering.  Important that it was UPDATED.  Game Stop could have done a lot of things here, and they did something that IMHO will HELP the squeeze happen.  I argued in my previous DD [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4wq5t/why\_rc\_and\_gamestop\_want\_us\_to\_win\_this\_fight\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m4wq5t/why_rc_and_gamestop_want_us_to_win_this_fight_and/) that they wanted the squeeze and I'm more confident in ever that this is still the case.

A rundown on what an ATM offering is vs a traditional secondary offering and why it matters.

In a traditional Secondary stock offering a company announces that they will be selling more shares from the treasury into the market.  They do this to raise cash plain and simple.  When you buy stock, no money goes tot he company, only to the seller.  Offering more shares is the way that the company makes itself the seller.  Typically a secondary offering will take the form of ""X million shares at Y dollars a piece""

Any offering of stock CAN reduce the share price in the short term (though it doesn't always) because it puts more shares into the overall market.  The total value of the company is thus divided amongst more shares.  The offering price in a traditional offering can often function as a leading indicator for the market about what kind of share price to pay because that is what the company is valuing those shares at.  Price may drop (or even increase) depending on the offer price.

An ATM (At The Market) offering works differently.  An ATM offering is where a company reserves the right to sell shares whenever they want, in any quantity they want, until a certain value or share count threshold is reached.  The primary advantage is that it allows the company to better capitalize on the share price being high at any given moment, and can result in much lower dilution of the float.  It also allows the company to have money on tap whenever they need it instead of having to push out a whole bunch of shares all at once.

Game Stop ALREADY had an ATM filing in place before today.  They had the right to sell ~~up to 3.5 million shares total~~ until the total float was 300,000,000 but only until they sold $100 million worth.  THEY DID NOT USE IT.  This is critical.  $100m divided by 6 million shares (roughly how many would have been needed to make $100m)  means about $16-17 a share.  Game Stop didn't think they were worth $17 a share.  They changed their filing to allow them to sell ~~the SAME 3.5 million shares (remember, UP to 3.5 million, they don't have to~~) a MAXIMUM of 3.5 million shares but to raise up to 1 BILLION DOLLARS.  That means that Game Stop thinks their stock is worth AT A MINIMUM $285 a share.  Once all the premarket nonsense and FUD is spent, real analysts and people who know a thing or two are going to realize that Game Stop just set their own short term price target.  Anything less than that is going to be a bargain.

The 3.5 million shares on tap for an offering were already known!  This was already factored into everyone's understanding and analysis regarding the squeeze!  If the shorts needed a total of 3 million shares to cover this would worry me, however they need more, WAY MORE.  I personally believe that they need 100m or more shares to begin to cover, 3.5m is a drop in the bucket and doesn't help them in any way.

Ok Ok, so that's the deal with the ATM offering, so how does this help the squeeze and why does it mean they want it?

1. They could have upped their offering to increase shares offered, they didn't.  While upping the value of the shares offered means they are looking for more money (because of higher share price obviously) they could also have upped the number of shares they wanted to sell or thought they would need to sell to do it.  They didn't, they kept it the same.  They know the math regarding the shorts and what they need better than anyone.  They could have offered enough shares in one fell swoop to end all of this and make us all sad, they didn't.
2. They set a real world expectation that their shares are worth at a MINIMUM $285 a piece.  Their offering makes it mathematically stupid for them to issue even a single share until the share price is greater than $285.  The higher it goes, the fewer shares they need to offer.  Getting us a new floor up around $285 is amazing and will give confidence to retail investors wondering ""gee, are these really worth $200 a share?""
3. They (imho) have completely eliminated any concerns of major dilution.  Their previous filing with the SEC noted that they don't have any plans to significantly change their share offerings (and they haven't, just updated the old one) and that they have plenty of cash on hand and no debt issues.  I think these 3.5m shares (when they sell) are going to be the last that we see for a while.  The lurking fear that they might just pull a move like some other companies and double the float overnight is gone.
4. This might very well be the catalyst that starts the squeeze.  If people know that the company is rock solid set on $285 a share and accept that as a new support price, the wave of buying up to that point this generates could be the additional buying pressure needed to put the final nail in the coffin.

Lastly if I can get silly and pull my tinfoil hat too tight for a moment, the recent tweets have been signaling that last week was the spring sale which would end yesterday.  If shares were trading under $200 and Game Stop knows that they are going to be setting a new target of $285 (come this morning) then last weeks $191 closing was indeed a sale price!

As I argued before, I think RC and the new leadership have a plan to help shepherd along the squeeze because it will create the **WEALTHIEST, MOST LOYAL FAN BASE OF ANY RETAILER IN HISTORY.**  Today's updated filing does nothing but strengthen my belief that that is true.

TLDR: Game Stop just telegraphed that at some point in the near future they will have a billion in cash to play with, and they are going to do so without putting the squeeze in jeopardy or meaningfully diluting our share price.  Game Stop thinks these shares are worth MORE THAN $285/share minimum.

&#x200B;

Edit:  Changed to correct to (At the Market) rather than at the money as pointed out by a friendly commenter.  added TLDR

Edit 2:  As has been pointed out in the comments by several helpful commenters I was wrong in my post about the previous offering and have made the facts clearer in the post.  This info actually makes this updated offering MUCH MORE BULLISH.  Previously, the offering could have resulted in tens of millions of shares offered to make a fraction of the money for the company.  The specter of potential dilution was factored into the share price and holding it back.  The changes in the current offering all but eliminate that fear COMPLETELY.",2021-04-05 14:09:15

I know, I know... why the fuck didn't I wait until the squeeze happened.... I know, I'm being irresponsible... I know, I know. Just so everyone knows I was able to contact an old work buddy and have a job already lined up but this post isn't about that. It's about the Diamond Balls I learned to develop by reading r/GME posts. 

I was stuck in a dead end job for years and just went to work to get my paycheck. My managers kept taking advantage of my hard work and talking shit behind my back but I just never cared what they thought. I just kept my head down, enjoyed the other people I was working with and kept working hard. 

Then I saw a glimmer of hope last year when Covid happened and wanted to take my chances investing. I always heard to invest when a recession hits and so during the March 2020 Plunge I took my chances with some retail company stocks last year in March. I kept putting my paychecks in the stocks and just held, never sold. 

I was able to grow my portfolio from $0 --> $50k in one year on a $27k salary. Fucking blew my mind but I'm realizing it was because of the incredible 2020 bull run and luck had a great part in it.

Then Jan. comes and I start hearing about GameStop. It hit its peak at $450 but then started going back down fast. That's when I liquidated two-thirds of my portfolio and bought 175 shares at 100 cost basis.   

THEN THE INCREDIBLE HAPPENED

I began waking up from the slumber I have been in for years at my dead end job.  I started standing up to the Managers that enjoyed sucking the soul out of their employees for fun. I told them how they are the reason everyone quits and they need to learn to respect their employees more. 

LOL .... BOY DID THEY NOT LIKE THAT

For the last two, months I have been a target for everything bad within the organization. They say, I'm the reason the department is doing bad. 

THEN TODAY..... I showed up to work and they sent me home without pay because I've been talking back. SOOOO..... I gave it couple of hours. Drove back there and went straight to HR and told them EVERYTHING on how these managers have been abusing employees for years and I'm quitting because of it. 

By the time I was done talking, I had HR in tears because of the TRUTH I told them. These managers aren't supposed to send employees home with no pay. Plus I have no bad record and have been outstanding employee for years so whatever I say is GOLD. She felt so bad she paid for the day today. BASICALLY THEY'RE FUCKED. 

The reason I'm sharing this is because when I liquidated my portfolio and put most of it into GME, I gained some sort of SUPERPOWER in my real life. I can't explain it but it's like I took the LIMITLESS PILL. I knew what was wrong and right and wasn't afraid to showcase it to the world. 

I FOUND MY VOICE BECAUSE OF GME.

Since **naked shorting** is no longer considered speculation seeing as **GameStop themselves acknowledged the SI being above 100%** (can't be ""really"" done without **NS**),
along with **ETF's slowly becoming an irrelevant tactic**, HF's will FTD on their short positions **which results in FTDs on their hands that they have to declare

These orders are so big ($115B) they are done in blocks with trigger points or buy limits, 120.34 being one. As it rises so does the trigger point, it moves up 120.34 then 122 etc. Moving up as the price moves up so the blocks are getting bought (although be it with naked shares as we are not selling atm). We need to hit the trigger points and keep hitting them and the algorithm will not be able to wash the shorts through the OTC/DP to replenish the amount they have to use which is why we see them starting with 300k sometimes, **depleting them slowly, as the buying pressure dies down they gain the shorts back**.

&#x200B;

*Once again, as stated before, we believe that retail does not posses the buying pressure that we are seeing.*

&#x200B;

# Post the order, loophole the FTD, recover shorts to continue attacking the price, repeat.

&#x200B;

**You can't continue doing this forever**, the SI will just continue increasing because **nothing is actually being covered**, they never had the shares to begin with, **the entire pool is synthetic**.
If the price point were to get triggered, if the buying pressure was too intense for the algorithm to keep up, they would not be able to wash their short's fast enough to replenish the amount of short shares available for the HFT to tank the price and **the price would be on a rapid increase, a reverse snowball will happen**.

&#x200B;

That would explain such quick price rise into the 130s. It would likely be more around 135ish now as the trigger price would have risen. This combined with the one around 182 if we could link these buy points together **this would trigger a sharp price rise quickly or at the very least allow the price to rise in a more free fall type manner as suggested in the previous thread**.

&#x200B;

With that being said, due to the attacks we saw on **Thursday and Friday** to **keep the price down**, the trigger point has most likely moved into the **200-220 range**, before you go on a rant about how we're constantly moving the trigger point back each time GME doesn't moon at said trigger point, get realistic please, this is GME we're dealing with here, a **completely fraudulent system** as you all should know by now.

&#x200B;

As stated before : 

> The trigger price is around the 182~ but needs to stay **ABOVE**, simply **hitting the price target and dropping back down seconds** later is **not enough** to start the reverse snowball.

&#x200B;

Why else would you post such a huge wall on open? *Unless*...

# TDA Power outage

[Where have I heard this before? Haha.](https://youtu.be/F3goSYkVPNE?t=80)

Don't assume we harassed the shit out of every intern at TDA over the weekend, because we fucking did.

&#x200B;

We used over 30 people, 30 different phone numbers, called at different times so they wouldn't assume it was one person calling over and over for some crazy response.

&#x200B;

Except that's what they gave us.

&#x200B;

For the most part, they would put us on hold and hangup,

&#x200B;

We gave TDA a call to ask them about how the volume column works, **a representative from Trader 1 confirmed that this is not a bug and indeed a true number**, however he instantly transferred me to a supervisor who ""should be able to answer all of my questions""

&#x200B;

We spoke with the supervisor, conveniently 30 seconds into the phone call after mentioning said anomaly **he told us the power to the entire office went out**, you basically know what happened next.

&#x200B;

We are going to bury TDA, it doesn't matter what they tell us anymore, we're done talking to them.

&#x200B;

# ""Speculation""

This is where our favorite word comes into play, the theory will be tested if we see a proper breakout to initiate the **trigger into a spiral**, along with our **beta of** ~~-36~~ **-7~-26**.

&#x200B;

If you still think this is a bug, I would highly suggest reading into this more before telling all your friends.

#Goldman 10.5B liquidation

Goldman liquidating is considered an **[act of war.](https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1376293019842879488)**

From DU : 
> Today will be a day of reckoning, I feel for the stock and It's price and fluctuations.

&#x200B;

> We saw large block trades happen on Friday and over the weekend as HF were forced to liquidate assets. 

&#x200B;

> This could mean one of two things could be in store for us, this of which we won't know till we see some real movement in the price and different pressures.

&#x200B;

> A) It could be a freeing up of assets to have the collateral to **short GME and other already shorted stocks even more.** (as Melvin capital would say ""When you're already fucked why not just double down one more time.) 

> Goldman Sachs has **5,900~ puts against GME** so freeing up assets to attack the price could be **real and allow them to recover some of their lost capital and continue the fight**. 
> While at the same time they would be helping themselves, they would also be helping other HF's who have already shorted the stock to oblivion and keep doing so in the hopes that retail will shake and trigger a sell off.

&#x200B;

> B) Could be actually getting the margin call on them and having to add into the already high buying pressure that is pinned against artificial selling pressure. **Eventually the buying pressure should begin to over take the selling pressure allowing a reverse snowball effect to happen where the price would just tumble out of control.** (think back to the robin hood putting a stop to buying how if they would not have done that the price would of gone into the **10s of thousands**, we'll never know.)

&#x200B;

> Pre-market is actually being quite interesting, this is something I have not seen before, the quick jump up is giving me the idea that there is a lot of buying pressure coming up with not very much selling pressure holding it down, or the selling pressure is having to reset every so often.

&#x200B;

> (I'm assuming this is the short share wash happening needing to replenish the stack under pressure allowing a nice price jump to occur.)

&#x200B;

> If we see this nice kind of consolidation throughout all of pre-market and close to the start of open this would be a good sign for whats in store, as **holding the price down through artificial selling pressure is finally coming to an end**.

&#x200B;

> Seeing a nice consolidation going into the end of pre market would allow for the stock price to get a nice drive down (AKA short attack) at the start of open which has been seen as a common thing everyday.) 
> This is one of the biggest things HFT does to help the price hit a jumping point.

&#x200B;

> If all of retail were to hold through the artificial sell off, VWAP would come straight across.

&#x200B;

> If the buying pressure during and after the sell off was high enough** it would launch the price up and over the point of HFT being able to control it**. 

&#x200B;

> The price would actually be pulled upwards to the VWAP line giving it added pressure to shoot out the other end, think of this like a **bungee cord**. 

&#x200B;

> The HFT **can only artificially tank the price so far before it has to shoot back**, with this theory, **assuming the buying pressure was extremely high throughout this time**, it would send the price moving the other way,** snapping the cable that is tethering it** to the VWAP line.

&#x200B;

>  **I truly believe that the price almost let go on Friday** but during that morning sell off, retail sold their shares and tanked the VWAP, after this the fight was lost. **It was more about consolidating the price, holding the numbers, causing max pain rather than launching the rocket ship**.

&#x200B;

>  My one key thing I can tell you is the **opening sell off is fake and to hold for dear life when it happens**. The bounce with added VWAP pulling **could launch us into the stratosphere, even beyond.**

Theory is that these anomalies directly correlate with HF's posting FTD coverage, ~~-36~~ -7~26 delta + gamma squeeze = [tsar bomba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBNhYOmEgy0)

My first DD on GME! And yes of course I'll add the obligatory ""this is not investment advice but rather my own opinion based on publicly available information. Carefully consider your own investment objectives and risk factors before investing.""

TLDR: Nearly the entire float of available GME shares trades hands EVERY SINGLE TRADING  DAY. Stocks with extremely high Turnover Ratio like this are subject to VOLATILE and sometimes VIOLENT changes in price, depending on which side of the demand/supply equation you’re on. With 2x-5x float likely in short and naked-short synthetic positions the MOASS is not a question of if, but when. 

I don’t know about you folks, but I guess after a few down days and a $224/share avg I needed some additional reassurance that our GME will indeed take off one day. So, I dug deep into the memory banks and recalled one important supply-demand ratio from my investment finance classes, namely the Turnover Ratio (TRO). 

Do you ever notice how some stocks seem to soar suddenly, often with little or no news? While other stocks can receive ongoing great news and hardly move higher at all? Well, my smooth brained apes…as you can imagine it’s all about supply and demand.  

At the end of the day what makes a stock rise in value? If you answered “more buyers than sellers” then you win a banana! So how do we compare one stock to another and determine how changes in demand can affect the upward (or downward movement) of the price? 

A quick definition check: 

10-D AVG VOL (10-day average volume): Reflects more current trading activity, expressed as average daily volume over the last 10 trading days 

FL (Float): We’re all well versed on this one, but just in case float is “the number of shares outstanding, or all the shares there are for that company,  minus what is owned by insiders and what the company is holding back (treasury stock). In a nutshell, associate the float with the supply of shares available to be traded at any given time by the public.” 

So with those definitions in mind, I decided to pull Yahoo Finance’s Top 25 most active stocks for today, March 16th and dive right in. Most active stocks are listed in order of today’s volume. I then added additional columns for, you guessed it, 10-D AVG VOL and FL. 

This now sets us up for the simple TURNOVER RATIO (TRO) calculation, which is 10-D AVG VOL / FL. 

If the float is very large relative to the average volume (lots of shares out there to be bought and sold in relationship to the average volume) we would see a low turnover rate and thus an onrush of buyers would not move the price much (think Ford stock) 

However, if the float is low relative to the average volume (a lot of people wanting very few available shares,) a sudden rush of buyers could move the price of a stock dramatically (think Gamestop).

So how does our precious little GME rank. Have a look at the image above and see for yourself! 

GME’s TRO is 93%. Ninety-Three Per Cent!!! 

That's 25% higher than the next highest security (Sundial), and a whopping 86% higher than the entire group average!

This essentially means 930 out of every 1,000 tradeable shares of GME have changed hands every single day over the last ten days. 

This tells us GME is a VERY volatile a stock that will trade violently given an imbalance in supply or demand either to the up or downside.  

So let me ask you this: Did you sell your stock recently? Did you? What about you? I sure as hell didn’t? So how the fuck is this possible? Easy. This is exactly what all the brilliant DD’s before me have already confirmed: There are synthetic GME shares out the whazooo being traded ALL DAY LONG. With short and naked-short interest estimated anywhere between 2-5x float we are about to witness a historic MOASS imbalance play out before us. 

My fellow apes and ape-ettes, we are patiently waiting for liftoff on the “right” side of this very equation. All you have to do is HOLD and continue to keep this Turnover Ratio in our favor. The greedy idiots that decided to double and triple down on GME’s demise WILL be held accountable someday very soon. 

And don’t forget to ensure your 5-pt harness is buckled up tight. When this thing takes off we’ll be pulling G-forces that’ll peel our eyelids back and leave a stream of diarrhea behind us.  

See you in the Oort Cloud!

Everyone is going to try and justify why you made a lot of money and they didn't.  They're more risk averse than you and you just got lucky.  They'll equate you with a lottery winner.

But this isn't the lottery.  This is your choice and based on what multiple experts have called ""better analysis than 90% of what they see from professional traders "".

You.  Yes, you.  Guess what?

You're not gambling.  You're taking a position that this stock has more value than others can see.  You're looking into the future through a lens that others can't comprehend.

You're right and this tough road we are all on is you earning the right to have that smug smirk on your face while others tell you how lucky you were.

And behind your smirk you'll know it wasn't luck.  It was diamond fucking hands and slapping hedge funds while they try to manipulate the market.

I'm proud of your resolve even if those close to you aren't.

1. Accepting Donations
2. will there be a short squeeze or gamma squeeze
3. 100k not possible?
4. shills spamming his content in praise

&#x200B;

[here is a link of his livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxT8bp4qBjk) : i know i might be called a shill for posting this link, but i will be referencing certain timestamps and there is a compilation of some important timestamps i have listed below.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Warden = good crayon ape GME 🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

# 1. Accepting Donations:

I agree with many apes that we should be careful with who to trust and support because they could be using our community as a way to earn money (ex. this happened with bruce as people pointed out how often he was asking for donations/subs). I watched most of the livestream and didn't seem to be begging for money. This section is the one i am most cautious about because he still was accepting money, but he only started using it due to his livestream (never asked for donations in any previous post) and used them as a way to curate questions more easily rather than having to wade through the youtube chat. which, he doesn't appear to have moderators for the chat yet so there was a lot of spam/possible FUD that i'm assuming he didn't want to deal with. (not that he didn't read chat, i think he set up the donations as a better way to talk about relevant topics and hes a broke college student which i can understand because so am i)

&#x200B;

# 2. no short squeeze or no gamma squeeze?

For starters Warden **did not say there would be no short squeeze at any point**. I think the people who are calling him a shill are referencing when he predicted that the stock would have a similar steady rise as tesla did in its squeeze until a catalyst causes the gme to launch away from the '172 diagonal' (a support trendline that warden references heavily). he references this starting at 1:44:03 in his livestream where he gives his 'prediction' and mentions a slow steady climb until a catalyst

Warden did however say that he does not think a gamma squeeze is possible at the current levels gme is at right now. at 1:26:09 he provides his input on the gamma squeeze. he says that he doesn't think it will be possible because the brokerages won't allow trading of 0DTE options anymore and because of the high IV of options right now that make premiums insanely expensive right now which will reduce the amount of calls that could be bought to fuel a gamma squeeze. this seems to make sense based on my limited knowledge of options.

&#x200B;

# 3. 100k not possible?

2:04:44 he comments on the 100k price target possibility. **he says it's possible**

2:45:47 is six figures reasonable? he seems unsure about pinning a direct yes or no and still says maybe

3:15:32 price target? doesn't have one and will play by ear and follow the exit strategy he posted on reddit. he also mentions the 130k price target predicted by an AI model and proceeds to explain that he doesn't support it because the model wasn't released for others to validate, unknown parameters of the model, and the fact that the model probably doesn't account for FTDs, short interest, options open interest (calls/puts). he concludes that the model doesn't mean anything. again he said six figures is possible earlier, but that he was going to follow his [exit strategy DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m073v6/exit_strategy_dd_a_comprehensive_guide_to/).

&#x200B;

# 4. shills spam praising his content

[here is his comment response and a little bit about the 100k target.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/maxgh1/wardenelite_has_been_compromised_with_proof_pt2/grv25ls/?context=3)

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

**I do not think Warden is a shill or anyone trying to spread FUD**. All of what he is saying is backed by technical analysis and other community member's research/DD. he is a great member of the community and we need to remember, now more than ever, that the Hedgefunds are trying to spread disinformation and distrust. I support his work and all the work members of our community put in to provide us apes with useful DD.

3:56:52 - What happens if we hit 150 or go below the 172 diagonal? (short answer - it will most likely bounce)

3:58:48 - What if Earnings is Bad?

4:15:29 - Does he think gme needs a catalyst to launch (sa - yes, otherwise upwards movement along 172 d) (he believes the catalyst **is** gme stating that there is good long term growth potential in the earnings call)

4:25:34 - Will gme cause the market to crash

I don't believe this is a smart move *at all*. Getting the SEC involved right now has a significant risk of them coming in and shutting down trading completely, if they decided to tally the books. Best case, this will benefit the hedge funds, market makers and DTCC by giving them breathing room to come up with damage-limiting strategies to cover their corruption. Worst case, they might decide forced liquidations of the counterfeit shares at a ""reasonable price is the best course of action, to prevent contagion and ensure stability"" yadda yadda yadda. I can hear the soundbites already.

The SEC has known full-well for years what's been going on and never moved. Ask yourself whose side they're really on.

Write to the SEC after the squeeze or the minute there is more manipulation - if that happens again, make their ears bleed. But not before.

So when the squeeze is squoze and you have your millions, shot a 100k back into the back end and wait for the stock split, then wait for the stock to rise and get even richerer.

I'd be surprised if the stock dropped back below $500, and I think 1k might be more probable, but I'm speculating here. The following point is still true.

&#x200B;

So settle down kids, it's story time.

1. squeeze is sqouze
2. you cash out at 1.5m/2m a share
3. you buy back in at the backend, lets say 500
4. you put in 100k per pre-squeeze share
5. you get back 200 shares for every pre-squeeze share
6. daddy cohen does a 10:1 stock split
7. you now have 2000 shares per pre-squeeze share
8. price is now $50, but you have 2000 shares, you still have 100k worth of stock
9. price goes up $10 to 60
10. you now have 120k worth of stock
11. price continues to rise to $100
12. you now have 200k worth of stock
13. but you originally had 5 shares
14. so times that 200k by 5
15. you now have another million
16. you've millionaired yourself twice
17. welcome to the high life

19. BUT WHAT'S THIS?! NANI?!!
20. You're used to holding now, you have millions already so you think fuck it i'll leave it in, see what happens.
21. stock rises to 200, you now have 2 million
22. stock rises to 500, you now have 5 million
23. stock rises to 1000, you now have 10 million
24. stock hits a sell wall at 1500, you have 15 million
25. meh, you're diamond as fuck now, you just stand outside of your mansion waving at passers by all day, you're made of diamond, there's fuck all else to do, you're like a living diamond statue
26. price drops to 850, ydgaf

https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mo038k/04102021_the_fud_news_on_melvin_stop_believing/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

This is a FUD campaign. I guarantee next week we'll see articles about a squeeze, ""Melvin's covered for realsiez guys,"" and other FUD tactics to make people think the squeeze has happened.

Until we see official documents stating a 49% loss, take it with a grain of salt. It's serious confirmation bias!""



---------_______

They can cheat and piss on the market system have the SEC in their pockets, do shady shit to the stocks, no way they can do anything in their balance sheet and P&L.

Now:
If they had covered their shorts in January which was suposedly responsible of the 49% loss, only a complete maniac would risk shorting it yet again, the board would not risk another investment that made them lose HALF their revenues, nor would their CLIENTS. This is just nonsense. However, the shorting attacks have carried on, borrowing shares, naking shorting,  corrupted medias, shills etc.  

TLDR: If they covered the shorts, they wouldn't short GME again. Auditors would highly recommend to forget about GME.


If they didnt cover their shorts, those losses come from the borrowing fees, the liquidity issues (forced closing other positions to be able to short and short again) if you stand on losing even more than 49% , you will do anything to avoid bankruptcy even if it means bleeding more. At this point, the auditor can be neutral as opposed to very discouraging.

TLDR: The only reason you would short is if you still think there is a way out and you don't want to go bankrupt.


Fellas, I gotta say this is some fucked up shit. The 1M floor is not a meme. Shorting and shorting and shorting  again just make this floor higher and higher. Enjoy a wonderful week-end .

I assume I am not alone in my thoughts. I do not know any of you but you made a similar decision that I made in investing in GME. The events of the last weeks/months have only more confirmed my thought that this thing will go off eventually. 

My point of writing this: just because nothing positive is being thrown around on this subreddit does not mean I'm going to sell off. If other lurkers are anything like me, they're holding until the moon. No amount of bots/shills/FUD is going to scare me off. The DD is solid and I'm here to stay.

Hope all of you are getting settled in nicely here in our new sanctuary. I remind you that you all turn this place from house into a home. Let's get right into it.

Many of you may know me from my previous posts depicting the Deep ITM calls being bought out of the PHLX exchange. Interestingly enough, for the first time since this whole thing started, no large trades of Deep ITM calls were made.

[GME Biggest Trades 4-5-2021](https://preview.redd.it/53s8h7u46hr61.jpg?width=1223&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af04c21756471feb558c9482e70c13fe31378c2a)

A smart ape name [u/glide\_si](https://www.reddit.com/u/glide_si/) suggested that these large trades were often seen back to back with another duplicate trade suggesting these calls were being rapidly bought and sold. We speculated that this was one way the shorts were hiding their FTD's. With the recent addition of DTCC rule that from my understanding is preventing this process from happening (creation of synthetic shares) have we finally seen the end of this massive Deep ITM call buying. Hard to know what is to come as a result of this but my gut tells me the end is near.

TL;DR: NEW DTCC RULES PREVENT HEDGEFUNDS FROM COVERING UP FTD'S WITH DEEP ITM CALLS

ARTICLE:

The retail stock trading frenzy will reach a new crescendo in the coming weeks thanks to the US government’s stimulus cheques but the inflation this support could ignite represents a threat to the stock market bull run, according to Citadel’s Ken Griffin.

The founder of one of the world’s biggest hedge funds thinks the $1,400 sent out to millions of Americans this month is likely to fuel another spasm of retail trading before activity settles down to a still-elevated level. Amateur trading would remain a powerful feature in US equities, he said.

However, in a rare interview with the Financial Times, Griffin warned that huge amounts of central bank bond-buying and government spending could jolt US inflation out of its decades-long torpor and unsettle financial markets just as they were attracting more retail involvement.

“Given the incredible amount of stimulus that has been unleashed, there is a possibility we see a real surge in inflation,” Griffin said. “The question is whether it is transitory or becomes permanent and structural, and there is a much higher chance that it becomes entrenched than any other time over the past 12 years.”

On the whole, Griffin says he is optimistic on the outlook, and hailed the retail trading boom as a way for more Americans to benefit from the US stock market. But he warned of a doomsday scenario in which accelerating inflation deepens a bond market sell-off, sends stocks tumbling and stokes unrest among retail investors hurt in the process. 


Fears over inflation are growing across the investment industry, with accelerating price gains and a bond market “tantrum” highlighted as the biggest risks that markets now face in Bank of America’s latest monthly survey of investors. The percentage of investors expecting faster inflation over the coming year in March hit the highest since at least 1995, when the survey began.

Citadel is one of the hedge fund industry’s largest players, managing about $34bn. Its flagship fund returned 24.4 per cent last year despite the turbulent markets, and this year it was up about 5.2 per cent to the end of February, according to people familiar with the matter. Over the fund’s 30 years it has averaged annual gains of 19 per cent, burnishing Griffin as one of the hedge fund industry’s biggest and most consistent performers. 


However, Citadel recently found itself embroiled in the controversy surrounding GameStop, the video games retailer whose stock was whipsawed by hedge funds betting against it and a horde of bullish retail traders loosely organised on the WallStreetBets forum on social media site Reddit. 

The fund stepped in to bail out Melvin Capital, one of the biggest hedge funds betting against GameStop. When Robinhood, a brokerage popular with the new generation of retail traders, was subsequently forced for regulatory reasons to curtail trading in GameStop, many Reddit users seized on a conspiracy theory that it was at Citadel’s behest. Citadel Securities — a separate high-speed market-maker also owned by Griffin — is one of Robinhood’s biggest revenue sources, paying it for the right to execute the trades of its customers. 

The firestorm led to Griffin testifying at the House of Representatives’ financial services committee hearing on the GameStop saga last month. Although Robinhood attracted the most ire and Griffin testified that Citadel had nothing to do with Robinhood’s decision, he did not escape unscathed from opprobrium from some Representatives.

Griffin largely shrugs off the controversy as a social media-concocted tempest stirred up by populist politicians. But he also argues that the saga foreshadows a wider, thornier problem of what happens when retail traders and passive index funds start to dominate more of the stock market, with prices becoming more detached from reality.


In US equities, passive funds are now roughly as large as the actively managed investment universe after a decade of rampant growth, while retail investors now account for nearly as much as all mutual and hedge fund trading combined. 

Griffin highlighted how an oblique tweet of a McDonald’s ice cream cone and a frog emoji from Ryan Cohen, a big GameStop shareholder, appeared to be the spark for a doubling of the stock’s price in one afternoon in February.

“The fact that the tweet of an ice cream cone can move markets will be the subject of academic study for years,” Griffin said. “It represents a dynamic where certain stocks are now almost exclusively owned by retail and passive funds. You’ve taken out active investors who focus on traditional metrics in valuing an equity.”",2021-03-28 21:03:02

For those who don't know what Failures to Deliver (FTDs) are please [watch this video first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0WXg5T3cBE) for a very basic understanding of what is going on.

# SEC FTD data

The SEC reports FTD data bi-monthly on their [website](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm). This cannot be the complete data as redditors are figuring out that they are in the pockets off Wall Street.

Thinking about these FTDs and how they work I was wondering if there was a loophole somewhere here since the DTCC is the one accepting the money and issuing stock at T-3.

# Analyzing the parsed data

Apologizes in advanced. There wasn't time to make a beautiful graph with Python but these EXCEL screenshots should do. This data isn't 100% as there are missing price values.

This [first screen shot](https://i.imgur.com/YdWR23g.png) is the first reporting for the first 8 trading days of February 2021.

* Total of FTD shares on Feb 12, 2021: 520,025,767
* Total USD lost/missing on Feb 12, 2021: $2,935,128,904.75
* Total FTDs lost for the first 8 trading days of Feb 2021: 3,343,420,578
* Total USD lost: $29,185,691,803,84

Wow.

Let's look at the total for the month of Feb when the two data files are added together:

[Total February 2021 FTDs](https://i.imgur.com/wcLKjGG.png)

In the month of February of 2021 during the 3 day delay between payment received and issue of share 3.3 billion shares went missing for a grand total of $29.1 billion dollars.

Now the idea is if FTDs don't go above the 1-2% of float it is okay to happen.

Really? Is it?

# So where is this money going? Those FTDs don't just disappear in a trash can when they fail do they?

In 2019 [Richard Evans did a lecture on naked shorting and FTDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncq35zrFCAg) in ETFs that is on YouTube. This is university level and very dense so come prepared to this video.

Richard Evans explains that:

* ETFs can be purchased in bundles of say 50k
* Those ETFs can be ""unpackaged"" like a box
* Now they have 50k shares of each company
* They can be sold on the open market to retail investors
* Or do what is called a naked short and borrow shares to short a stock based on the fact that it is know somewhere down the road shares in the ETF will FTD and become available to buy again.

This can successfully be done because the DTCC is continuously selling everyone fake shares.

Basically:

* Stock dealers/brokers send a retail investor's money to the DTCC
* DTCC issues synthetic shares to the customer with a T-3 promise to deliver it.
* FTDs occur because it is part of the legacy system.
* Customer keeps fake shares that they can instantly start trading with while waiting for T-3
* FTDs are never covered so those initial shares end up always being fake
* DTCC takes these FTDs and they are added back into the market by shorting
* ETFs that FTD are unpackaged as Richard Evans explains
* THOSE ""unpackaged"" ETF shares eventually FTD over time
* INFINITE LOOP

# When in doubt zoom out

In 2009 Talis Putnins wrote an article about [Naked short sales and FTDs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228260887_Naked_Short_Sales_and_Fails_to_Deliver_An_Overview_of_Clearing_and_Settlement_Procedures_for_Stock_Trades_in_the_US).

It included [this graph of FTDs](https://i.imgur.com/a6I0yOM.png) leading up to the 2008 market crash. This is monthly reporting (green O and red X).

For the month of July 2008 there were 320,000,000 FTDs

Go back to the data I showed:

[February 1, 2021: 520,025,767 FTDs](https://i.imgur.com/rIvg5JU.png)

[February 2, 2021: 233,964,946 FTDs](https://i.imgur.com/m89nCnR.png)

[February 3, 2021: 238,301,130 FTDs](https://i.imgur.com/ci0mw0X.png)

**It appears the system is failing at an astronomical rate DAILY**

This infinite loop of naked shorting cannot stop. Once it does the entire stock market erupts.

**TL;DR:**

**DTCC issues fake shares to everyone and keeps the money. These FTDs can be used to naked short the market. ETFs that FTD can be ""unpackaged"" and suddenly 50k ETF shares turns into 50k shares of each company that is in that ETF. Then either dumped on the open market or used to short it.**

**In theory this could allow Wall Street to export USD inflation by issuing fake shares or DTCC money to international companies/governments using the T-3 legacy system.**

**Given that the system is backed up AT LEAST 3 days it is completely overloaded and primed to explode unravelling what could be decades of manipulation.**

**One insane catalyst could blow up the system.**

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some are asking for more validation. The person who discovered the 2008 market crash, watch The Big Short, Michael Burry has been tweeting about this problem and has recently deleted all his tweets.

I won’t claim to have insider information and I won’t disclose my methods, but 120 was the breakpoint. There are artistic people out there that obsess over these things and understand numbers/trends very well. Take what follows with a grain of salt, but this was my work:

On Sunday night, I calculated the outcomes of many scenarios with SI % ‘X’. The outcome of said calculation was then used to determine a “break-price” where probability of a sell-off would be ‘Y’.  Obviously there are many variables that can’t be accounted for in a calculation such as this, but I took a random sample of X holdings and pooled them together to look at how prices rose or fell with certain volatility; trends show that once volatility reaches a certain benchmark as a % of volatility in a 6-12 hr timeframe, mass sell offs are almost 3000% more likely to occur through triggering stop-losses and certain extraneous variables aforementioned. This was interesting in GameStop, because the breakpoint through every simulation was different, but reached its highest probability at 120. That was the target. 

*Before you flame me for LARPing, look at my post from yesterday saying that they were attempting to get the price to 120 for a breakpoint.  I’m more confident in my model now that we saw them achieve 120, saw a good number of paperhands sell, and now we’re climbing again. That was all they had left.  They didn’t account for the variable of us being absolutely apeshit crazy. We continue to win*

They are so predictable that some artistic redditor (🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻‍♂️) has them down to a science and can quite literally mathematically determine their next move. 

I’m not saying this is going to moon tomorrow, but they are bending. It’s only a matter of time before they break.

And what better way to hurt people then to use up all you got to make sure the squeeze doesn’t happen on the 19th tomorrow. Because people are getting excessively emotional it might hurt and they’ll wish that people start selling shares thinking it’s over and cause a sell off. WE CAN STAY MORE RETARDED THAN THEY CAN STAY POWERFUL. DONT FORGET. All I know is that tomorrow is going to be sooo volatile that it’ll use about almost all of their financial power. If it doesn’t happen tomorrow. It’ll happen very soon. Especially because next week also has a lot of events and stimulants too that will encourage buying. 

In conclusion: stay calm, every day we hold = every day we are winning. The promised day is near. HODL AND KEEP HODLING UNTIL THE SQUEEZE KICKS OFF

**Important Disclaimer:** **Please do not think this post is a substitute for doing research!** My intention with this post is not to give you the easy way out of doing research. My hope is that this serves as an entry point for those that are new to investing in GME and those who are new to investing in general. As someone who has been following everything since the end of January, I cannot imagine how intimidating it must seem to get up to speed on the situation. While the DD Compilation is an amazing resource ^((That you should start diving into right after this)) it is a lot to take in for an amateur investor. So, with that said I hope that this FAQ can serve as a companion piece to that more comprehensive breakdown of the situation. If nothing else this post can serve as a way to reduce the high volume of basic questions we all see every day, I will just copy/paste the link to this when I see those kinds of posts or comments.

One last thing: I am open to feedback on this FAQ, I am expecting that it will be an ever-evolving thing. If you think something should be added, taken off, or changed, just let me know in the comments or through chat. I am usually here on the subreddit between ***Allthetime*** and ***Waytoomuch***, so I will probably see the suggestion.

That is entirely up to you. This is and has always been a high-risk play. Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose. **There is no investment advice here.**

**Am I too late?**

Again, the answer is up to you. The short sellers likely need every share to cover their positions. If you want to buy one share, but haven’t because it seems like not enough-- Please remember that every share matters, the float isn't very large to begin with. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**When is the squeeze?**

Nobody knows, and nobody will know. Unfortunately, because of all the variables and moving parts, it is literally impossible to predict. It has become apparent that building up hype over specific dates can be used against us. We have in the past seen dates that everyone built hype around only to have them pass and enthusiasm wane within our subreddt. That having been said, **we ask that people stop asking when this will happen. Furthermore, please take any dates you do see on** r/gme **with a grain of salt.**

**Why does holding do anything?**

They need your shares to cover their short positions! They got greedy. Thinking GameStop would fail, the short sellers started *Naked Shorting* the stock. Long story short they created synthetic stocks with their special privileges as Market Makers. But they can’t cover a short with a synthetic share. So because of the Naked Shorting, the Short Sellers, multiple large greedy money managers, and Hedge Funds need a total number of shares greater than the number available to purchase. THEY NEED EVERY SHARE, EVEN YOURS [CONAN](https://twitter.com/ConanOBrien/status/1364324912396140554)! \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**aRe YoU GuYs MaNipuLatIng THe MaRKeT?!**

To be extremely clear, as there is a lot of misinformation flying around. No, we are not. This subreddit is in no way a form of market manipulation. We aren’t the ones manipulating the market here. The purpose of r/GME is not to “Pump and Dump” the stock, despite what some media sources will tell you. Instead, r/GME is just a community of individuals investing in the same stock separately. Furthermore, **any use of the words ""we"" or ""us"" in any posts or comments is not indicative of manipulation. The use of such words that suggest we are a group only serve to refer to the users that frequent this PUBLIC community** (Often referred to as “Apes”).

r/GME is a place for sharing, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFO, as well as theories and excitement. In this community you will mainly find:

\-Amazing theories from people who spend hours pouring over data

\-High-quality Technical Analysis, the likes of which would be super expensive to get otherwise

\-Some really great memes

\-The actual truth about the incredibly heinous market manipulation plaguing GME.

\*\*How are these crazy high share prices that people cite, possible? 100k 500k etc.\*\*No one knows how high the squeeze could take the stock price. The best rational reasoning says that these numbers are possible through the laws of supply and demand. Furthermore, it is likely that the Short Percentage is a lot higher than reported, with many suggesting that the short-sellers, cumulatively, need more than 100% of the float to cover.

**What is a Short?**

A Short position is fairly simple to understand. When someone thinks a company will do poorly or is bound to fail, they can establish a short position on said company’s stock. To do that one must borrow shares from someone willing to lend them, and then sell those borrowed shares. Then you put that money into your piggy bank for later. Assuming all goes according to plan, the stock goes down like you thought, when the stock drops to the price you are happy with you then buy back the shares you borrowed. You grab the money you sold them for and buy the shares, you give them back to the person you borrowed from and make off with the leftover money.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**So then what is a Short Squeeze?**

The Short Squeeze is a fairly rare financial phenomenon. Basically, when a bunch of institutions think a stock will fail, sometimes they will all pile on the short positions in the same place. More often than not, they probably make a lot of money from this tactic. But occasionally they will get noticed and if everything lines up just right, this “Short Squeeze” can occur. Usually triggered by a catalyst of some sort, Short Squeezes usually happen when the stock doesn’t go down but instead goes way, way up.

When it goes high enough that the Short Sellers' other assets are no longer larger than the potential loss they are risking in the stock they shorted, they will get Margin Called. At that point, they are told to buy the stock back at whatever the price because the Clearing House doesn’t want to deal with the elevated risk. Once you can’t afford the risk you’re out. This margin call, theoretically, only has to hit one institution before the dominos start falling. The Margin Call causes increased buying, increased buying sends the price up, the price going up means more Margin Calls, and so on.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Why are people saying that the short interest could be more than 100%?**

Despite all major reporters of short interest having numbers much lower than 100% on their sites, it is unrealistic that the short interest is as low as they claim. Here’s why:

\-The industry is largely self-reported, meaning that HF’s can choose to report lower numbers if it benefits them. While this practice is illegal, it is only punished with a fine. This fine is often much smaller than the potential loss or gain, the HF may experience if the true data were to be reported. This is fine that Citadel LLC. (One of the bigger HFs shorting GME) has had to pay multiple times in the past, so there is precedence.

\-It was discovered by some Apes that there was an abnormal increase in short interest in most of the ETFs with GME inside them. The increase coincided with the spike in January and following that, the media started pushing the “Shorts covered” narrative that was everywhere last month. You can read up on the ETF Short Interest info in the DDs here. To summarize, the short sellers of GME essentially disguised some of their position with shares of **E**xchange **T**raded **F**unds (ETF). By establishing a short position on the ETF and then establishing long positions in every stock in there except GME you basically cancel out your short position in the ETF, leaving only a short position in GME. 

\***^(Important Note: This does not mean there will be a short squeeze on the ETFs! An ETF cannot really be the subject of a short squeeze due to the mechanics behind them \*)**

**Why Gamestop?**

Short Squeezes can happen anywhere there is high Short interest. Gamestop however is a special case (Hence the use of the term/ acronym, MOASS). Gamestop’s Short Sellers got extra greedy in this case. They were sure that Gamestop was going to die in the wake of the pandemic. So sure, in fact, that they began Naked Shorting the stock like crazy. Had Gamestop failed and went under, they would have never had to cover all those positions. They would have just went on their way, cash in hand, off to short another company into the ground...

Suddenly a glimmer of hope began to emerge for Gamestop, this hope in the form of Ryan Cohen, an “Activist Investor'' and CoFounder/CEO of [Chewy.com](https://www.chewy.com/app/content/about-us). Finding success in past endeavors, people believe Ryan Cohen, and his plan to turn Gamestop around spell out the end of the line for Short Sellers. Around the same time, DFV started sharing his Bullish thesis on Gamestop’s turnaround. After getting hate for a long time for his “Outlandish Theories”, people in the Reddit Forum r/Wallstreetbets started to really take notice, now believing that DFV’s theories were right all along.

To explain where we are now is difficult, as one could realize from a cursory glance the story is complicated. **To summarize as best I can:** The Short Sellers seem to have disguised their short position, even perhaps doubling down. They then manipulated the media to spread the word that Gamestop was dead, the squeeze was squoze. While at the same time they employed the use of social engineering to slowly depress the positive sentiment for the stock on Reddit and elsewhere. Recently, it seems that media sentiment is slowly changing as it becomes too obvious for the media to ignore that Gamestop is not even close to dead. The media sentiment changing also seems to coincide with some large investors, of unknown identity, hopping on board the rocket with massive long positions being opened. Many see these large investors as the last confirmation they need that Gamestop is going to the moon. Regardless of the squeeze, I, personally, like the stock.

**What is Naked Shorting?** 

Just like Shorting, but with more illegality! Through archaic loopholes in the laws governing the financial industry, some individuals participate in Short Selling **without actually having the shares.** This essentially creates a counterfeit share. When this is done, the short-sellers are taking on a lot of risk, but the payoff can be grand. It's not easy to actually catch the naked short-sellers red-handed but some look to the Failure-to-Deliver data to shed some light on it. Naked shorting is also how it's possible there is more than 100% of the shares out there at the moment.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Who is Ryan Cohen?**

Ryan Cohen is on the board for Gamestop, holding the most shares of any individual (9,000,000). Cohen is also head of the  Strategic Planning and Capital Allocation Committee for Gamestop, essentially putting him at the helm of the company's pivot. After Cohen's past successful venture with [chewy.com](https://chewy.com), and seeing the people that he is bringing to the table at Gamestop, there seems to be a very clear and profitable path forward for this company.  In November of 2020, Cohen released an [open letter](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) stating how he believes the Gamestop board and CEO had been failing at their jobs, he goes on to lay out a bit about how they could do better with Gamestop as a company. 

Ryan Cohen clearly believes in Gamestop, and it seems that he fully intends on taking the reigns as CEO. As of writing this Ryan Cohen is not yet CEO, though soon we expect to hear some announcements from Gamestop regarding Cohens roadmap and/or his becoming CEO

**Catalyst? What do you mean and why is it important?**

Essentially the catalyst is the spark that lights the fire. This catalyst could be anything that triggers buzz around Gamestop (the company) or news about the stocks. It is unknown exactly what will be the event that triggers the MOASS. This Subreddit is full of theories though, I would highly recommend reading them. Below is a shortlist of some of the potential catalysts people are speculating about:

\-A Stock Split, or some similar move from Gamestop that recalls shares

\-Ryan Cohen’s official appointment to CEO

\-Gamma Squeeze

\-Gamestop’s Q1 Earnings Call

\-Some speculate Gary Gensler (Newly appointed head of the SEC), may make some move that sets things in motion

**What is a Shill and why do people keep calling me that?**

One of the MANY things that the HFs have tried to do to curb-stomp retail investors, is flooding our public communities with Reddit accounts (Some bot-accounts and some actual people who seem to have been paid) purposefully spreading negative sentiment. I know it sounds like a conspiracy but there is plenty of proof. These accounts have been seen all over not just Reddit, but also Youtube, Twitter. Not just conventional social media though, also places like MarketWatch, Yahoo finance, WeBull, basically anywhere you could talk about GME. The term “Shill” is a blanket term for those accounts, be them bots or people. 

In the past, these ”Shills” have utilized many different approaches to spreading **F**ear **U**ncertainty, and/or **D**oubt  (FUD) about the stock and the company. One of these beings, flooding the subreddits with super basic questions, that lacked any substance at all. This was seemingly in an effort to give the illusion that if you were still holding GME you didn’t know what you were doing, because when you looked around you were surrounded by people who didn’t have a clue. This, along with most of their other attempts to shake retail investor faith, has failed.

You may have been called a Shill for one of a number of reasons. This community is very inclusive and open to everyone, but because of the blatant attacks this forum has suffered a lot of people are understandably paranoid. (Myself included). **Please, unless you really are a shill, don’t take it personally.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What is a “Short Attack” (aka “Short and Distort”)?** 

The Short and Distort is a time-honored tradition of illegal market manipulators. First, they ***short*** the stock, then they ***distort*** the image of the company. This is a practice whereby the Short-HFs actively suppress the price, most of the time through the spread of bearish-misinformation about the company in question or the technicals of the stock.

We are seeing this in Gamestop in the form of FUD campaigns and Media Manipulation.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Shill-Based-FUD and how to spot it:**

First of all, it is incredibly important to note **your potential biases** when determining if someone is just a shill trying to spread FUD. Not all FUD is invalid, someone may bring up a solid point against an otherwise great DD, and that could scare you. Remember that just because you do not like what someone is saying, doesn’t make it invalid. **It is important users here work with constructive criticism to refine their theories.**

Instead of shooting this person down as a shill, ask yourself the following: Are they making a valid point? Is it backed up with evidence? Have I fact-checked this evidence?

If you answered no, to these questions, a great next step is to check their post history, Here are some things to look for: Are they constantly posting negative-sentiment, as if they have something to gain? Do their posts/ comments sound coherent? Are those posts repeating the same or slightly different things (copy/pasted)?

Since this forum and others where GME is discussed are public, the ones behind this petty attack can see what we say and how we react to their ILLEGAL MANIPULATION. This means that since this has started (back in January) these Shills have gotten smarter, and less obvious. They become easier to spot over time, don’t worry. When you spot a Shill, report it to your local Mods and downvote the post/comment.

**New FUD tactics, What to look out for:**

The tactics that have been used on this community are absolutely despicable. At first it was pretty benign, but with the recent attacks on individuals in this sub, it has crossed a line. If these individuals happen to be reading this, I hope you understand how pathetic you are. **I feel it is important to remember that these actions being taken against us only serve to prove that there is more to this situation than meets the eye.**

Unfortunately, they are always finding new ways to fuck with us. With that said, here are some noteworthy ones as of March 28:

\-**Spreading FUD about users in** r/gme, more specifically, users that post some of the most viewed DD. 

\-**Bringing into question the integrity of the Mod Team**. With the Mods at r/wallstreetbets being accused of being compromised, this FUD was easy to see coming. Since there was already a precedence for it, the shills believe it an easy task to convince us the same thing is happening here. 

\-**Fake DD.** This can mean a few things, there are different ways a 'Fake DD' is done. One type is as follows, The post seems to start out with a positive sentiment but takes a negative turn and ultimately doesn't disseminate anything of value. Another type, this one being far less difficult (and thus likely more common) A DD that comes to a negatively skewed conclusion through the use of lies and false data. This Fake DD can be combated quite easily, thankfully. All you have to do is read the DD, fact check some things, and read some comments, then you can upvote it. Wildly upvoting every DD is a surefire way to let FUD slip through the cracks and get to the top, thats where it can do the most damage.

**How do I, as a retail investor, stand a chance against the Hedge Funds?**

There has been much debate over how the retail investors cumulatively stack up in terms of shares held. With all sorts of numbers floating around, it is impossible to know just how large a slice of this pie we are hodling (holding). I recommend reading some of the many DDs on this though. Regardless of the exact percentage, it seems, based on what data we do have, that the narrative of retail investors being on the sidelines of what is actually a Hedge Fund vs. Hedge Fund Battle...

is false. Perhaps, prior to January, that narrative may have been more accurate, but since then retail investors have been buying on every single dip in the price… That's more than two whole months of buying-the-dip. Now, I will not speculate on numbers here, if you want to know more you will have to read the DDs on that.

I have been a lurker in these parts since my buy-in in January and would like to share my thoughts on some of the posts and comments I have encountered here, namely the ones denying that this is about more than tendies and denying that this is a collective effort. Posts stating that we are in this together and that this is about more than personal profit, often get met with fearful responses, pointing out that there is no ‘we’, this is only about tendies etc. Assuming that these replies are not coming from shills attacking morale, but are motivated by the goal to protect us from legal consequences (i.e. the accusation of collective market manipulation), I would like to provide my thoughts.

First, a couple of words about me: I have a couple of years of experience in the justice system, both as a corporate lawyer and a judge, albeit not in a common law country. However, I have dealt professionally with matters of EU competition law. Despite this, the following is of course neither financial nor legal advice, so take everything with a grain of salt :-).

Now on to the subject matter. Judging from the posts here and on WSB, people invested long in GME come from all walks of life and a diverse group of countries. We are all here following our own - albeit likely influenced by DFV - judgment regarding the value of this investment. However, the motivations for the investment are as diverse as the individuals making the decision. Some of us are here for individual profit, some are here to give the finger to Wallstreet and see hedgefunds burn, others see the chance of balancing the scales of economic justice, etc. pp. Obviously, each and every one of these motivations has merit and is a valid reason to be in this fight. Following each of our individual motivations led us here, placing a bet against big players on Wallstreet. The fascinating abnormity of the current situation is, that our individual bets only succeed, if a large enough number of us decide to hold onto our overshorted stock to the moon. 

So when people state that ‘we’ are in this together, they are technically correct in the simple sense that each of our individual bets will only pay out, if enough apes diamondhand. Otherwise, all we accomplish is to make other Wallstreet players rich(er), and who needs that. In order to forge enough of us into diamondhanded monkeys, mental fortitude and trust in each other is needed.

I think the ‘we are in this together’-aspect of the situation needs to be reiterated and enforced in order to increase the likelihood of a near infinite squeeze, which would in turn allow each and every one of us to reach their respective goals. 

And it is imho legal for us to do so. To qualify a behavior as market manipulation under EU law a set of specific criteria needs to be met and I suspect, similar principles to be applicable in common law countries. In broad strokes there at least needs to be a dominant position on the market in question of the actor(s), either individually or collectively and secondly, these actor(s) need to take coordinated action to restrict supply in order to achieve predetermined price targets. 

The individuals on this sub do not hold a dominant position in this sense. Even if we collectively own (multiples of) the float of GME, we do not act as such a collective. The key to define a market manipulating collective is that the individuals participating in the collective can be forced to adhere to the collective's decisions (enforcement mechanism). We do not have an enforcement mechanism since being called a paperhand is not a strong deterrent. Each and every one of us is free to exit our positions at whatever price point we individually deem appropriate.

Second, we have not collectively determined a target price. I have seen numbers ranging from 10 k to 20 m $ as the ‘floor’. Since the discrepancy between these is huge, there is - in my view obviously - no effective coordination going on. 

In closing I would like to say that it is an honor for me to fight alongside all of you. I know that my goals of a more just economy and prosperity for my family and friends can and likely will be achieved thanks to our collective resolve.

I hope some of you find value in my thoughts and wish you a nice weekend :-).

Citadel buying DC regulator to keep markets rigged & dark

Not going to post very often unless I really think it'll be of interest, but it was just announced today that the most recent Chairman of one of Washington's most important financial regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), was purchased, er, I mean hired by Ken Griffin at Citadel; as [www.bettermarkes.com](https://www.bettermarkes.com) press release below states, this is how they rig the system against you ( [https://bettermarkets.com/newsroom/epidemic-regulators-selling-out-highest-big-finance-bidder-undermining-public-confidence](https://bettermarkets.com/newsroom/epidemic-regulators-selling-out-highest-big-finance-bidder-undermining-public-confidence)):  

**The Epidemic of Regulators Selling Out to the Highest Big Finance Bidder & Undermining Public Confidence via the Revolving Door Must be Outlawed**

**Washington, D.C.** **–** Dennis M. Kelleher, President and Chief Executive Officer of Better Markets, issued the following statement in response to [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/citadel-securities-hires-ex-cftc-chairman-tarbert-as-legal-chief?sref=mQvUqJZj) that the most recent Chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was just hired by Citadel Securities:

“The announcement that the most recent Chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has been hired by Citadel Securities as its Chief Legal Officer is just the latest regrettable example of a senior government regulator appearing to sell out his public service to big finance via the revolving door. Recent ex-regulator hires at Robinhood, Coinbase, D.E. Shaw, Apollo Global Management, Spring Labs and many others preceded this latest revolving door hire by Citadel. 

“This is little more than legal corruption and bribery. That’s why the revolving door used to be looked down upon as disreputable and sleazy, often referred to as ‘influence peddling.’ This undermines the trust and confidence in government by the American people and it demoralizes the many hard-working public servants who sacrifice to actually serve the public.

“Out of hundreds of millions of Americans in the workforce, it is implausible that these people are being hired solely on the merits. They appear to be purchased, at least in part, for the insider knowledge, access, and connections they obtained while purportedly serving the public. These revolving door purchases are examples of how Wall Street uses its economic power to buy political power to keep the financial system rigged to enrich themselves at the expense of retail investors, the financial system and, ultimately, the country. This corruption disgusts the American people and Congress should outlaw it by prohibiting former regulators from working directly or indirectly for any entity within their jurisdiction while in government for not less than five years.”

Self-Regulatory Organizations; NYSE American LLC; Notice of Filing of Proposed Rule Change To Amend Rule 970NY and Rule 970.1NY To Eliminate the Use of Dark Series on the Exchange


The Exchange also believes that the proposed discontinuation of its suppression of quotes in dark series would increase transparency and enhance price discovery. Specifically, as proposed, all Market Maker quotes (including in “inactive series” under the current Rule) would be displayed and reflected in the market to the benefit of all market participants who would be on notice of such liquidity. The Exchange also notes that, over the years, certain market participants have expressed confusion regarding what quotes are being published and which are being suppressed. Therefore, the Exchange believes that the proposal would remove the element of potential confusion among market participants by publishing all quotes (not just those in active series) in the disseminated quote feed.



This rule was setup to get approved/denied or wait period extended. 


The Commission is extending the 45-day time period for Commission action on the proposed rule change. The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period to take action on the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,[5] the Commission designates May 9, 2021 as the date by which the Commission should either approve or disapprove, or institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove, the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NYSEAMER-2021-05).

https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-06233.pdf


CFE proposes to add new Section U to P&amp;P XVIII to specifically reference two examples of practices that are prohibited by new Rule 620(b)(iv). In particular, CFE proposes to add new Section U of P&amp;P XVIII, which will provide that (1) engaging in a pattern and practice of submitting partial messages for the purpose of seeking to reduce latency has the potential to disrupt the systems of the Exchange; (2) purposefully corrupting or constructing malformed data packets also has the potential to disrupt the systems of the Exchange; and (3) the Exchange considers any market participant engaging in either of these practices as part of a trading strategy to have recklessly disregarded the potential to disrupt the systems of the Exchange in violation of new Rule 620(b)(iv).



The second proposed example includes the following fact pattern: A market participant engages in a trading strategy where the market participant’s trading system is designed to purposefully send to the Exchange untradeable orders or orders that have no reasonable probability of trading. For example, prior to the occurrence of an event or signal, the market participant’s trading system begins transmitting to the Exchange data necessary for an order message (e.g., Ethernet frame; TCP packet; etc.). The trading system is designed so that if the event or signal does not occur as expected, the trading system will complete the partially transmitted data and successfully submit an order message to the Exchange. However, because the event or signal did not occur as expected, the trading system is designed to render the completed order message untradeable or improbable of trading. This may be accomplished, for example, by submitting the order message as a fill or kil order type with a price or quantity that causes the order to immediately be cancelled by the trading platform. This may also be accomplished, for example, by submitting the order message at an off-market price, deep in the order book, and intending to cancel that order prior to execution.



The second proposed example includes the following fact pattern: A market participant engages in a trading strategy where the market participant’s trading system is designed to purposefully send to the Exchange untradeable orders or orders that have no reasonable probability of trading


The proposed rule change is consistent with similar updated guidance provided by other designated contract markets (“DCMs”) regarding disruptive practices.3 The Exchange believes that aligning its guidance regarding disruptive trading practices across DCMs where appropriate protects the Exchange, investors, and the public interest by promoting uniform expectations among market participants regarding disruptive trade practices.







TL:DR

SEC trying to make more transparency. 
Dark pool Info won’t be so dark. 

And new rules for sending in bogus orders to try and manipulate the price.

# 🦍💬  “I’m worried the SEC will filibuster NSCC-801 or reject it outright. Can you tell me something to steady my frail, trembling paper hands?”

If an institution gets liquidated and still can't fulfill their liabilities in full, a portion of that cost passes down to other NSCC members, who don't really want to foot the bill for someone else's foolishness. Better to cut out the rot before the whole limb gets infected, get me?

# 🦍💬 “The concept of time is incomprehensible to me, which is why I buy options with less than 7 days to expiration. Just tell me when this thing will pop off.”

# Edit: This is in no way a recommendation to purchase options, particularly those so close to expiry. This was intended as a tongue-in-cheek dig at the folks who did, and I used it as a hyperbolic proxy for impatience. Sorry for the confusion! Don’t mess around with options if you don’t know what you’re doing, it’s one of the fastest ways to lose money and there are some pretty fast ways out there.

Don’t fucking sweat it my guys.  Just sit your ass back and enjoy the ride and the popcorn.  If you're impatient, you're feeling urgency, the urgency can lead to anxiety. The likelihood that the SEC is going to let it ride for the full sixty days is pretty darn low.

**TL;DR -** The OCC is making a more concrete gameplan about whose money exactly goes where if someone in the commission's equity goes absolutely tits up. Brokerages that deal with options markets are the relevant entities here (Apex Clearing being the more commonly-known amongst them), and the OCC is asking everyone to pony up some cash to build up a reserve that they can dip into if someone racks up a default loss so huge it spills over to the rest of the gang.

**TA;DR -** The country club full of option market makers are worried that one of the option market makers in their club is selling so many naked calls that they're going to bring the country club down onto everyone's heads, so they whipped up a ruling that asks everyone for some cash to throw into the pot to patch things up if someone burns it all down, and if anyone looks like they're carrying around too many matches, they're going to get the money punched out of them.

**TL;DR -** Back around last year, the Fed said ""hey COVID's pretty rough on the economy, so we're gonna let banks and other institutions not count all the Treasury securities and deposits towards their leverage,"" which basically means ""we're giving you more margin to work with so that you can still give people loans and shit while the economy is fuk"". 

That provision only lasts until 3/31 of this year, and the folks who were banking on it getting renewed were in for a gnarly surprise. It's four days 'til and no sign of that happening. So when this rule expires, bam, those Treasury securities are going to count towards that leverage ratio again, and if there was anyone abusing the extra margin (or exposed to it, like being a Treasury bond ETF AP like Jane Street) and doesn't have the liquidity to bail the fuck out before the timer on this rule runs out, badabing badaboom.

What I'm posting to talk about, though, isn't about the DD or the memes or the misbehaviour of hedge funds / cnbc  or making history or etc. It's about *what I see you doing with the money you receive.*

The Wall Street Elite tend to come from money. They've had one, two, twenty legs up from parents and connections and etc. You didn't. A persistent political myth is that the working class, so wrongly painted as 'unwashed masses', are simply too stupid to make good decisions. You have [embraced](https://youtu.be/7St9TtLzoLk?t=49) this as apes, which I *love,* yet... what are you doing with your money? Good things. Reasonable things. You're paying down debt, helping your friends and family, donating to charity. Making the world better. The rich are the ones who waste their money on excessively unnecessary luxury, self-indulgence, and risk. The poor, suddenly made rich? We see them express the reciprocity, generosity, and sense of community they have known and relied on all their lives. You joke about lambos and yachts and I'm sure some of you really want that. But others - most others, I think - would look upon newfound wealth and the power that brings with an eye to goodness.

A rich man, who has known wealth all his life, will lose respect for it. But a poor man knows the true value of money.  [And knows compassion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ip8Pynrt4-U)

I have decided to stop my live thread. The reason being is simple enough, when the squeeze is happening, there will be a lot of people that will try and tell you what to do. There are also a lot of regular contributors (including myself) that have gathered a following. With that following comes power. I do not want to be responsible for accidentally misleading some apes because I thought my ego needed you all to listen to me.

There are a lot of people who are actively trying to get more attention and more followers. They have not talked about an exit strategy from their contributions and after the squeeze is done. These people can be bought out. These people can be doing it strictly for their own personal motives. These people want you to listen to them so they can have a voice to try and influence you when the time is right.

DD,1616290290.0,"This is my first DD and I am, by no means, a smart ape. I have skin in the game but will not post my position due to info that came out this week saying we shouldn’t. I am no shill, or intern, or troll. I teach and have a small Barbecue business on the side to make ends meet. 

This post is based on multiple posts across multiple subs and articles I have read obsessing over GME. I have been obsessively searching for answers on why closing above $200 on yesterday was so important, and why it looked like to rocket was suppressed (not by short Hedgies). I dived head first down the Delta Hedging rabbit hole along with others. Oh yeah... insert obligatory this is not financial advice or whatever black magic voodoo witch words I need to write that keeps me off the SEC’s shit list. 

WTF is Delta Hedging?? Delta hedging is when a seller of a call hedges the risk associated with that call immediately at buy. So if the stock price is $150 when you buy a call with a $160 strike then they would more than likely purchase the 100 shares to cover that call at sell. OR they will hedge it with other assets or calls or puts or whatever so long as it brings the delta risk to neutral.

This is how my smooth brain understood it. Let’s say someone buys a call that is far from being in the money (extreme out of the money calls, OTM) like my dumbass did on Wednesday when I bought 4 $800 calls. The Delta (or risk) on that call would be very low to the seller of that call. So if they hedged at all it might be like 5 shares of the 100 contract call they buy at sell. HOWEVER as the stock price increases the Delta (risk) increases, and they would buy shares (or other assets) to keep the Delta neutral. If the stock price decreases they sell shares or other assets, once again to keep the Delta neutral. 

This is explained EXTREMELY well by /u/Agamenc in the comments section of a related post on Gamma Squeezes. I highly suggest you take the time to read all the questions people ask and his responses. He may have put a wrinkle on my brain...

Delta Hedging is very very typical behavior for all Market Makers as they are not in the business of losing money on high risk gambles. 

So.... bad news yeah? No huge buy orders to cover Fridays ITM calls next week because they already covered right? Possibly. 

As it is very typical behavior for Market Makers who typically don’t take high risk chances, it is not typical behavior for hedge funds. 

Hedgies, like to gamble. After all this is the biggest casino in the world. 

That being said, there’s no way to know for sure if shorties delta hedged the calls from March 19th until we see, or don’t see, an inflation of the stock price due to large buy orders next week. 

So what was that epic Shorty vs Whale battle for $200 then?

It was to cut the financial legs out from the shorties because they bought an assload of PUT’s that expired worthless if the price was over $200.

Credit to /u/Dwellerofthecrags who pointed to the significance of $200 for both sides before the day began. 

So you ask yourself, why didn’t the long whales just fucking fire the rocket then??? Higher stock price only means good things for us and fucks over the shorties even more right? 

Wrong. I believe the shorties bought fucktons and fucktons of calls with a strike price from $250-$800 which expired on the 19th. Credit to /u/CM_MOJO for a brilliant, albeit very long, write up backing this theory. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m584h0/how_i_see_the_gme_end_game_playing_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

They did it last week and the buy orders were so large and so retarded (we are talking ape lev retardation on steroids here) even the media screamed market manipulation. 

https://www.streetinsider.com/dr/news.php?id=18113374

Sooooo..... if the price is below $200 shorties get paid. If the price went over $250 it would have rocketed with the amount of retail buyers buying in because of FOMO. AND the Market Makers who would be placing massive buy orders gobbling up shares to delta hedge the calls THEY sold to keep their delta (risk) neutral. Which would result in a Gamma Squeeze that would have ended the day WELL above $800. Which in turn would have meant the shorties got paid an insane amount on their call purchase orders. 

So we had some very fucking smart long whales who literally landed a fatal blow to the shorties and people don’t even know it yet. 

I don’t know if we will see a huge buy of shares early next week or not, and honestly it doesn’t matter. However, I fully expect the shorty attacks to be less in number and much weaker because it’s very hard to climb a ladder with gimp legs. I also expect them to start dumping other assets to avoid being margin called on their shorts due to lack of liquidity. 

TLDR: Long whales intentionally kept the price as close to $200 as possible without going under. This financially knee capped the short Hedgies as both their PUTS and CALLS expired worthless.",2021-03-20 18:31:30

If you haven't already, I highly suggest reading u/beowulf77's post of u/WuzGoodieN1gz 's DD, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m844o8/not_all_sells_are_enemies/).  It's really good.  
  
Now, you might be left asking after closing at 200 today: wHy DIdN't tHeRe bE sQueeZEs FoR mUh TEnDieS tOdAY?  
  
Two key points from the above link that you'll need to understand before I answer:

1. **Covert options strategies** - ""Enemy"" options were in play in places you might not expect.  Price going high might have been the hedgies trying to pull an ""uncle Bruce"" and offload share purchases onto options sellers.  Also, friendly whales might have been going for ""focused"" max pain (against the hedgies) instead of general market max pain.  So, instead of a rocket, we ended up at $200.
1. **Friendly whales BELIEVE** in us.  Like, ***really believe in us.***   Remember all of these ""guys I think we own the whole float!"" posts?  Uhh, you think that just, magically happened?  Like, nobody at any of the firms has done calculations into retail purchase volume flow, and just scratched their asses saying ""gee the pile of GME shares sure looks like it's getting low, wonder if it'll ever run out?""  u/WuzGoodieN1gz awesomely points out that friendlies have been *intentionally feeding us.*  We are like a fucking BANK of pitbulls that do. not. let. go. of GME shares.  So friendly's have been putting the burden of share ownership on us while they hoard cash for the be battle ahead.  Fuck yeah.  Teamwork, bitches!

***But whyr no squerze, Mr Monker?***
  
**NUMBER A.**  Pretend we live in a world where Citadel & co have relaxed rules, good capital reserves, a decent volume of GME shares available in the market, and a ""reserve bank"" of GME shorts.  The reserve bank is generally less effective and more expensive, but it has the benefit of resetting true GME shorts settlement and somewhat hiding the short activity.  Citadel also has several additional tactics they can employ in a pinch.  
  
**LETTER 2.** Now pretend we live in a world where Citadel & co have tightened rules, depleted capital reserves, a desert of GME shares in the market, and basically no ""reserve bank,"" so no way to reset the GME shorts as easily.  They have also almost no backup plays.  
  
**Now the moon ticket question:** *if you were a friendly whale, which of these two worlds would you want to fight Citadel in?*  
  
If you chose Roman numeral Beta., the second one, congrats!  You win a trip to the moon!  That's what the friendly whales have chosen.  
  
*A world with a bleeding Citadel that's almost bled out, stricter DTCC reporting with a congressional hearing underway, every share is already held by a sea of vindictive retail investors who have turned off margin accounts and glued the GME shares to their balls while screaming some weird form of financial jihad, ETF's who have lowered their GME share balances and can't be effectively shorted anymore, and nearly all other Citadel plays exhausted.*  
  
***And if you haven't figured it out, Number A was up until today.***  
***Part II (the second world) starts Monday.  With Ryan Cohen GME earnings call Tuesday.***   
***
***TL;DR***: enjoy what is quite possibly your last weekend on earth :) (but who cares about dates and timelines, anyway.  HODL.  Which is easy, and costs you nothing.  Aren't they glued to your balls, anyway?)  
  
edit: a word  
  
edit 2: king midas is guilding the shit out of everything.  Everybody get in here!!! 🤣🤣🤣  
  
edit 3: u/theThirdShake asked: How could / why would friendly whales “feed us shares”? - my reply: 
>...they don't want to tie up their capital with a huge GME position. They need some shares, but not so many that tie up their resources to buy options or otherwise stay in the black.

>That's where we come in. Friendly whales have discovered diamond hands aren't good with tactical plays, but are really good for 1) holding unreasonably, and 2) buying unreasonably - like at dips or dogpiling on squeezes. So they ""feed"" us shares - release shares to be sold to the market to be held. Generally, these shares won't be released back into the market, either sold or shorted.

877,Correcting false assumptions on AMC squeeze,1619898017.0,"Based on this article
 https://franknez.com/how-high-can-amc-stock-price-skyrocket-up-to/#:~:text=AMC%20hasn't%20squeezed%20for,investors%20are%20to%20squeeze%20them

I wanted to correct a couple things stated incorrectly in this blog.

1.  If a move begins after hours or premarket, retail traders are absolutely able to get in or out.  They simply change the TIF (time in force) on their order screen to EXT (extended).  

Now they may have to check with their broker and see if it is something auto available or access needs to be requested. The normal drawback for extended hours trading is lack of liquidity and fast moves, but if a squeeze is occurring then liquidity is pouring in.

2.  He states that shorts were able to cover their positions at $8 or on a run up a few dollars.  He makes the assumption that enough people holding actual real shares are dumping at the lower range.  Or they are going to dump on a little run up. 

The whole point of this is that there are only a certain # of shares available in the market and all have been borrowed and sold short. Plus, we believe that another 100-900% have been naked shorted.  That means additional shares beyond what is legally available to trade.  It has climbed that high because people continue to buy and hold (Ape style/Diamond hands) and refuse to sell until we see at least $500/share or more. 

So there is NO way shorts can cover their positions if the real shares are NOT being given to them. They are only trading air and manipulating the price of the stock down in short ladder attacks and price suppression. They do not want a squeeze at any cost because it will cost them $10s of billions.  

The reporting agencies are ALL lying about the #s short, just like CNN and other news agencies have lied about Covid case & death count. Whoever controls the flow of info decides what they want you to believe. It's up to you to be a dumb sheep or an intelligent Ape!

If more people begin to pile in and start buying, it will add such an astronomical # to the shorts who keep selling to stop the price from moving up, then the squeeze will occur.  The shorts will begin to try to buy out their position which will spike the price.  

Whoever is sitting on the Ask with shares to sell will not want to be selling shares that don't actually exist at that price so they will move out of the way or jump their ask price up significantly.  This is when you start seeing gaps occur in real-time.  Then market closes and dark pool activity takes place. The next morning the price is doubled.  If no one sells that day, the price doubles the next morning. Wash, rinse repeat. 

When we get to $400-$500 they are going to short millions again and purchase PUT options expiring near and 2nd week to try to recover some of their losses on the squeeze.  This will drive the price back to $40-$50 where they'll start buying their shorts and closing their options.  They will then purchase CALL options to recover more on the run back up.

I can assure you that all the apes will be watching the chart and price closely. You do **not** need to create a post informing everyone that it just passed 500; 1000; 2000; 5000; 10,000; 50,000; 69,420; 100,000 or any other number. We all know.

You do not need to post memes of rockets or diamond handed apes. 

You do not need to repeatedly tell anyone to HODL. They got this far, they'll figure it out.

You do not need to inform others that you are still hodling or that you just sold some or all of your position.

You do not need to create any post unless it is actual DD or a request for specific information. And, no, asking if it is a good idea to transfer from RH in the middle of the squeeze is not a request for specific information.

In short (pun intended), during the squeeze, if your post is meant to make others laugh, say ""Yee-ha!"", or do anything other than focus their entire soul and being on the the huge amounts of money that can be made, then you are a shill and really just need to shut the fuck up.

# How can you predict where GME is going?

As mentioned in my previous posts, I'm relying on Elliott Wave Theory to predict market movements.I'm not going to example all the details here, but if you are really curious you can:

* Read ""Elliott Wave Principle"" for free online at [https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle) or order a physical copy for $29 at [https://www.elliottwave.com/Book/Elliott-Wave-Principle](https://www.elliottwave.com/Book/Elliott-Wave-Principle)
* Read my previous posts [Why $10,000 per share is just a stop along the way...](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6cebh/why_10000_per_share_is_just_a_stop_along_the_way/) and [Elliott Waves & GME 🚀 Part #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md4emt/elliott_waves_gme_part_2/)
* Watch the recording of yesterday's live stream [Riding Elliott Waves to the Moon in GME (GameStop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcqC6lx3Ec)

**However, there are a few basics you should understand:**

1. The market moves in waves.
2. On the biggest degree/scale we are always looking at something called an ""Impulse"", a wave that splits into 5 subwaves (see 1-2-3-4-5 on all screenshots).
3. Each Impulse is followed by a corrective pattern (there are a few of those, labeled A-B-C or similar).
4. Each wave by itself is part of a bigger wave and contains smaller waves. Explained very well on this [one-page cheat sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VVTnzj67DOATFyisgIHTb_YfEN4CrkSb/view). In fact, that one piece of paper, combined with basic understanding (reading and understanding chapter #1 of the book) is likely enough to allow you to work with Elliott Waves yourself
5. Out of wave #1, #3, and #5, wave #3 can NEVER be the shortest.

To illustrate that, take a look at the GME monthly chart below:

[GME Monthly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/wwuv3hsz0kp61.png?width=1847&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa21d4d341a9fa8124d9a53b40c36f41b1d67097)

**Important:** The labeling in this chart violates two rules of the Elliott Wave Principle.

1. *Orange Wave II is below 0. This is in my opinion acceptable because we are looking at the chart since IPO*
2. *Orange Wave IV retraces below I. This is ok because Elliott Wave rules can't be fully enforced when the market isn't ""free"" (buying restrictions causing a bigger drop).*

Besides that, what you can see is:

* In Orange the biggest Impulse wave we are currently in, showing that we are currently in Wave V of that impulse.
* Once we finish this Wave V it will become Wave I (Green) of another Impulse of a bigger degree *(read the book, all of that is covered in chapter 1 in more detail).*
* Wave I (orange) contains another Impulse (1-2-3-4-5 in blue).
* Wave II and IV are corrective waves and we could label the corrective patterns in them. (Wave IV would require us to look at a lower timeframe to label its ""subwaves"" properly).

**What you should remember here is that we are currently in Wave V of an Impulse and that wave goes ⬆️.**

*Also, as you can see our orange wave V ends around $562 to $747, but this is NOT the squeeze but simply will turn this Orange wave into Wave I of another Impulse of a bigger degree. And this is not the final prediction for that wave either because as we map out waves of lower degree we'll get ""more accurate"" predictions.*

# How accurate are Elliott Waves?

I don't know, you tell me... *(sorry, getting annoyed by this question).* But let's take a look at some of the predictions I shared previously.

[Prediction \(Orange Range\)](https://preview.redd.it/5xcj9gg7yjp61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d0a8dcca4202c52e7b1b5019b3842f02377446)

Followed by me predicting (after we hit that area) that we'll see a drop to $137-$207 in the comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/).

In fact, Elliott Waves are that accurate that I was willing to do a live stream yesterday and predict the entire trading session in real-time at  [Riding Elliott Waves to the Moon in GME (GameStop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcqC6lx3Ec)

I could share a few more examples, but I'd assume that I got your attention now.

*Here I have to say that not all my predictions during the live mapping were accurate but not because Elliott Wave principles were wrong. In all cases, where my predictions were wrong I jumped the gun and labeled the chart too early with a wrong pattern, and only after a few additional candles corrected the mistake.However, if you want to know for sure and take the time to watch the recording of that stream you'll see just how on spot the predictions are/were when I labeled them right.* ***And we are not talking about labeling the past, but labeling a few existing candles to predict where the next candles are going to be.***

# Where GME is going?

I know most of you probably already forgot but here is the monthly chart of GME again with some extra information.

[Elliott Wave Projection for GME](https://preview.redd.it/0ev2ban23kp61.png?width=1741&format=png&auto=webp&s=df1397e1817648db77417e5ffab93033ef940442)

**Don't get too excited yet, because that prediction assumes that our wave V (orange) will be exactly in the predicted area and all following waves (green) will also hit the projected areas precisely.**

In reality, those levels will move a bit as we work out the wave patterns on a lower degree and as things play out.

Everyone that watched my live stream yesterday [Riding Elliott Waves to the Moon in GME (GameStop)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcqC6lx3Ec) knows what I'm talking about, but if you haven't the important points are:

1. Elliott Waves are highly accurate but here and there the price doesn't reach the predicted range or moves further.
2. When that happens we have to move the label for that wave which also changes the predicted price area for the following wave.
3. As a result, the price areas shown in the green waves are going to change ""a lot"" but we'll get more accurate predictions as we go (as more candles developed on lower timeframes and allow us to map out the waves of lower degree)

# Let's take a closer look...

Remember, each wave contains waves of a smaller degree, and thanks to our [one-page cheat sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VVTnzj67DOATFyisgIHTb_YfEN4CrkSb/view) we also know which ""subwaves"" to expect and with what frequency to expect them.

According to the cheat sheet wave #5 of an Impulse consists of another Impulse 93% of the time or an ending diagonal 7% of the time. (Both of those patterns are labeled 1-2-3-4-5).

[Reading the Cheat Sheet](https://preview.redd.it/snjio09z4kp61.png?width=260&format=png&auto=webp&s=5aabcccff5821f533044c3831b05a36f0acdee69)

**Summary of what we know based on our monthly chart:**

* we are currently in Wave #5 of an Impulse
* wave #5 by itself is another 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse or Ending Diagonal
* wave #5 starts at the low of $38.50 we had on the 19th of February

[Subwaves of Wave #5 mapped on GME hourly chart.](https://preview.redd.it/18o7e4u08kp61.png?width=1829&format=png&auto=webp&s=661169e21f28b25fdf2d556201130880351ec324)

As you can see above, I've mapped out the subwave of wave #5 on the hourly chart and if you read my previous posts [Why $10,000 per share is just a stop along the way...](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6cebh/why_10000_per_share_is_just_a_stop_along_the_way/) and [Elliott Waves & GME 🚀 Part #2](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/md4emt/elliott_waves_gme_part_2/) you'll notice that I did much of that before it happened.

Based on this (in red) we are currently in wave #3 (which is going ⬆️ ) and, as we learned earlier, this wave can never be the shortest.

**IMPORTANT REMINDER:** While the projected area for that wave #3 isn't even visible on the screen this does NOT mean that we'll shoot up there in a day because every wave consists of waves of smaller degrees.

To illustrate that better take a look at...

[GME hourly chart. Pay attention to the highlighted area.](https://preview.redd.it/ru58kmjv8kp61.png?width=1849&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f902eb80212a26a8c50ae47bce7b056f384b4d6)

*And just as a reminder, in the live yesterday, that you can watch by clicking on* [*Riding Elliott Waves to the Moon in GME (GameStop)*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcqC6lx3Ec) *I mapped out all the waves you see starting from {v} (orange) to the price at market close in real-time.*

# When/How do you know we reached the top and where/when are you going to sell?

I will use Elliott Waves and sell once I can confirm the corrective pattern that's following after wave #5 (of the biggest degree) which will be our squeeze. In other words, I'll do what I did during [yesterday's live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FcqC6lx3Ec) with the A-B-C (green) that connects I and II (blue) and will likely be able to sell between the A and B (green).

*(I know the recording is long, but it's weekend, the markets are closed, and watching (parts of) it might actually teach you something.)*

# Where does all of that leave us? Where are we going? When are we going there?

**TL;DR** According to Elliott Wave Theory, that stood the test of time and that I used myself to predict multiple movements in GME with incredibly high accuracy we are going up. With each new candle, the predicted price areas for our 🌚 become more accurate.

There are no predicted dates for that 🚀 launch, but that doesn't matter because based on current predictions I still believe that [$10,000 per share is just a stop along the way](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6cebh/why_10000_per_share_is_just_a_stop_along_the_way/), and if it takes a year to get there it's still likely the best investments I will have made in my entire life.

**Patience is key, because...**

>""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""*- Warren Buffett.*

And while I read most of the other DD posts I trust Elliott Waves enough to ignore the rest and calmly watch $100 and more drops because I expected them to come in advance and I know that the drops are just wave #2 and #4 of bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse waves that take us further up.

**Do NOT try to trade the waves, because here and there the price doesn't fully reach a predicted area, and you might end up missing up on big upwards movements.**

**IMPORTANT:** *The only situation where Elliott Waves don't apply or not all rules can be enforced would be if trading got restricted in some way or prices get ""fixed"" by the government. Outside of that Elliott Waves stood the test of time and also apply to previous squeezes in other stocks.*

***Obviously, as stated, all of this is just my personal opinion, and you should do what you feel is right.***

# Edit #1: Does that also apply considering all the manipulation that's going on with GME?

As stated at the end of chapter #1 of ""Elliott Wave Principle"" (see [https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle))

>All rules and guidelines of the Wave Principle fundamentally apply to actual market mood, not its recording *per se* or lack thereof. Its clear manifestation requires free market pricing. When prices are fixed by government edict, such as those for gold and silver for half of the twentieth century, waves restricted by the edict are not allowed to register. When the available price record differs from what might have existed in a free market, rules and guidelines must be considered in that light. In the long run, of course, markets always win out over edicts, and edict enforcement is only possible if the mood of the market allows it. All rules and guidelines presented in this book presume that your price record is accurate.

So, unless there are buying/selling restrictions or fixed prices set by the government Elliott Waves should apply just fine.

**Edit #2:** Since multiple people asked I've decided to live stream at [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsc1gAr0t2ME4nzu4PCAnow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsc1gAr0t2ME4nzu4PCAnow) daily (Mo - Fr) for the foreseeable future (unless I have appointments that force/require me to leave our apartment) and moved my regular setup into our small ""studio"". However, I won't comment as actively as I did during Friday's session but will stream one of my screens with my current predictions, comment/update on it every probably 30 minutes, and in between do what I'd usually do on my other screens.  
This should serve multiple purposes:

1. People that doubt the accuracy or still somehow think I label the past and nothing gets predicted can check in real-time how the waves develop and how much in advance certain levels/movements are predicted, and maybe watch live how my entire predictions turn out to be wrong.
2. Everyone that already is an Elliott Wave fanboy will get more insights and maybe some of you know more than I do (I'm by far no Elliott Wave Theory ""guru"") and can point out mistakes I may make along the way.
3. If/when we get to the squeeze I'll likely be live as well and people may use the information provided to determine their ""exit strategy"" or not, since I'm just sharing my opinion.
4. While my DD posts so far mention certain resources, and, as explained in [https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mecpjv/if\_you\_want\_to\_know\_where\_gme\_is\_going\_read\_this/gsk6ezi/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mecpjv/if_you_want_to_know_where_gme_is_going_read_this/gsk6ezi/) I don't benefit in any way if you read/buy the book or sign up at WaveBasis, it should be obvious, that I benefit eventually from YouTube if those live streams or videos gain me additional subscribers and watchtime and as a result, my channel is able to join the YouTube Partner Program. In any case, I think we all agree that the potential profits of my GME investment - assuming my predictions are right - far surpass any potential financial gain I might get on YouTube.

In any case, you make of that what you want, and if you want to see more real-time charting using Elliott Waves feel free to tune in to any of the upcoming lives.",2021-03-27 13:19:30
