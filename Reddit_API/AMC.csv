Disappointed in how some apes treated Trey this morning,1621561330.0,"This post will probably get downvoted to oblivion, but I do not care. It also brings me no joy to write this.

 The way Trey's Trades was treated this morning on his live stream was deplorable. We have to do better. MUCH BETTER. This man has put his mental and physical health on the line to bring us information, distill complex docs, and bring influential stakeholders to us to ask questions and how do we treat him. Berate him on his live stream because we didn't get the answers we wanted? Shit, he has no control over?

 

We're supposed to be better than that. As much as we promote this group as a family, we did not show that this morning. THAT WAS TRASH. Some may say I'm butt hurt ( I am), you may say that I'm emotional ( I AM). I don't enjoy seeing anyone treated that way, especially someone who has given so much of his time to us. 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, there was a slight error with the date. SO WHAT?! the plan remains the same. We are trying to do something incredibly complex. This was never advertised as easy money. This fight will be a struggle. We will have to fight tooth and nail for this. Yes, we're all excited, frustrated, tired, anxious. This gives us NO RIGHT to treat someone that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is also why we never discuss dates! From this moment on FUCK DATES. Sit on your fucking hands and wait. When this blows, there will be no way for you to miss it. Breathe, grab a soda.

A quick explanation to the sudden drop in utilization,1621374254.0,"Calm down apes.  First of all, congrats, we have gotten hedge fuckers attention and they are changing their tactics.  They know we are using utilization the gauge where we are so they have decided to change things around.  

The drop is no more than some HFs returning their borrowed shares.  So these shares are once again available to be borrowed, hence they are not being utilized.  We will probably also see an increase in share available to be shorted and also a drop in borrow rate.  

I assure you, everything is fine.  As many have said before, they are just delaying the inevitable.  This is one of their tactics to shake off paper hands.  How convenient of them to let the price rise after hour and then drop it like a brick, then show you that the utilization is no longer at 100%.  This is an illusion they are trying to portray, to trick you into thinking the squeeze is over.  The truth is, the squeeze has not even begun yet.

Why AMC dropped yesterday and WHY WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON 🦍🚀📈🌕,1622323169.0,"# [EDIT] Part 2 of my DD is now out! [You can find it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/noe17l/part_2_what_buy_hodl_actually_means_and_why_were/)

&#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER:** This is not financial advice. Please do your own research before investing your money.

&#x200B;

I see a lot of posts about the drop from $36 to $26 this Friday, but I haven't seen any decent posts explaining what exactly happened. So that's what I'll be trying to do in the next 5 minutes of your time. Strap in!

First of all, ***no***, it wasn't a planned attack by a big hedge fund to create fear and make people sell off. They can still cause flash crashes (free discounts for us!), but they can no longer stop us from going to the moon.

This doesn't mean there's isn't any shady stuff going on in the background, but that it is just not the reason behind yesterday's drop. Instead, it has to do with the basic fundamentals of options trading and market makers.

&#x200B;

# Introduction to options trading

**(You can skip this part if you know how options work)**

***DISCLAIMER:*** *This is very basic stuff. Please do not start trading options if you don't know what you're doing.*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/1y6rn3g3o3271.png?width=1498&format=png&auto=webp&s=6dba5fd34fb94d1c201ebf1839b8accf40ad0dfd

There are two types of options: call and put options. I will explain how call options work, because put options work identical, just the other way around.

If you don't know the basics of options (calls, specifically), here's a very short explanation;

>*' Call options are financial contracts that give the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock, bond, commodity, or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a specific time period. '*

Which basically means that a call option allows the holder of the contract to buy 100 shares at a specific price, called the **strike price**. So for example: You buy a call option with a strike price of $20. If the price of the stock raises to $22, the contract holder can buy 100 shares for $2000 and sell them right after for $2200, with a profit of $200. The call option is now **In the Money (ITM)**. If the price goes below $20, the contract is useless, which is commonly referred to as **Out of the Money (OTM)**, and the holder loses whatever they paid for the contract, which is called the **premium**.

Options have **expiry dates**. This is the date that contracts expire, which means the trader is required to either execute the contract or sell it. Executing the contract is not the interesting part for most people, but selling is.

This means that an option holder wants to sell their contract at the highest price, to make the most money. But option contracts lose value as time goes by, **exponentially**.

The price of a contract is split into two parts:

* **Intrinsic Value:** This is the price at which a contract would be worth at expiry. It is easily calculated and does **not** change value depending on the time. A call option only has intrinsic value if it's in the money (meaning, stock price is above the call strike price).
* **Extrinsic Value:** This is the important part. This value goes down as time gets closer to the expiry date. Why is this? Very simple: A contract that still has months until it expires, has a lot more potential to go in the money, than a contract that expires in a few days. An example: Say you have a call option with a $20 strike price, and the stock is currently trading at $18. To go in the money, the stock price must exceed $20 (in reality, it must be a bit higher). If it expires this week, you must be lucky if the price goes over $20. If you have months, the stock has a lot more potential to go over $20 during that time. This decrease in extrinsic value is commonly referred to as **time decay**. A measurement of how fast an option drops in value is the **gamma**.

Put options work just the same, except they allow the contract holder to sell shares (instead of buying) at a certain strike price. So if the price of the stock goes below the strike price, the holder makes profit. In the example above, the contract holder could buy the shares for $18 and sell them for $20.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

# Market Makers hedging

Investors buy or sell these options from or to market makers. That puts market makers at a big risk, because they can't just simply reject your order. That's why they need to cover their positions, better known as ***hedging***. Hedging follows these very simple rules:

|*Trader:*|*Dealer (Market Maker):*|*Dealer Hedging:*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Buys Call|Sells Call|Buys Stock|
|Sells Call|Buys Call|Sells Stock|
|Buys Put|Sells Put|Sells Stock|
|Sells Put|Buys Put|Buys Stock|

Market makers usually do their hedging right after an order comes through, and may take some time if it's a big order. Orders that were made overnight, are hedged at market open and market makers try to hedge all orders by the end of the day at market close.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

# Why this is important

Why am I explaining options and hedging, you might ask. Because it's key to understanding why AMC's price dropped yesterday. Contracts always expire on a Friday. And this Friday was one like no other!

This week, the amount of call options that were traded skyrocketed. People were buying lots of call & put options that expired this Friday, in the hopes of making a quick profit. If we look at the table above, buying a call option will result in the market maker buying stock, pumping the price up. Buying a put option does the opposite and results in a price decrease. While lots of people were buying call options and pumping AMC's price up to the moon, there were some retards who were buying put options. The amount of call options well exceeded the amount of put options though, which is why the price went up by over 100% this week.

Remember that options lose value exponentially as it nears its expiry date. That means that on Friday, all call and put options were losing value, fast. This results in lots of options traders selling their contracts before they expire worthless (OTM). What happens then? Well, let's look at the hedging table again. When lots of traders start selling call options, the market makers sell stock so the stock price decreases. When traders sell put options, the market makers buy stock so the price increases. This is commonly referred to as **hedge unwinding**.

Somewhere, there must be a balance between this increasing and decreasing of the price. This greatly depends on the call/put ratio. This balance price is called the **Key Gamma Strike** Price and can actually be calculated (it is very complicated though, and I will not go into this), for which there are online tools.

If you don't entirely understand what this Key Gamma Strike means, consider it as a center of gravity to which the stock price is attracted to. This 'force' is the main thing that is preventing AMC's price to skyrocket to the moon. One of [SpotGamma's](https://spotgamma.com/) tools calculates this Key Gamma Strike every day at midnight. Now here comes the interesting part:

**The Key Gamma Strike price was calculated Friday morning (before open) to be around $27. Guess what AMC closed at? $26.**

Big thanks to SpotGamma for this [awesome video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRx_y-UKjTg) explaining most of this stuff.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

# What this tells us about next week

Because of the crazy amount of stock buyers and call option buyers, we were able to more than double AMC's price this week. But now that the unwinding of hedges is done (because most options are already expired or sold), there is **NOTHING** holding the price down. If everybody keeps buying stock next Tuesday (or Monday for my fellow EU apes), AMC will go to the **MOON**.

I am very confident that this will happen because I believe in our fellow apes. We will buy the shit out of AMC and the **SHORT SQUEEZE WILL HAPPEN**. Nothing can hold us back anymore. Short interest is still high as balls right now and people will need to start covering their short positions. Once that happens, there is no limit to AMC's price.

I am putting all of my money into AMC next Tuesday and throughout the week. We will become millionaires. The rich will pay us back. The apes will unite against them and their shady practices will be exposed. Keep on HODLING, but most importantly, **KEEP BUYING STOCK**!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

# TL;DR

A crazy amount of options were traded this week, but many of them expired this Friday, causing market makers to unwind their hedges (sell stock) which resulted in a 'center of gravity' around $27. Next week, we can reload on shares without this force holding AMC's price down. Keep buying stock and **WE'RE GOING TO THE MOON**. **THE SQUEEZE WILL HAPPEN**.

For all of the new baby apes. I know a lot of you have questions, and I thought it would be helpful to provide you with some overall context to understand the significance of the movement you just joined.
Covid hit last March and a couple of big hedge funds concocted a plan to drive AMC into bankruptcy by “shorting” it and make a ton of money in the process. 

You “short” a company when you think the value of the stock is going to go down. When the country locked down and AMC closed their doors and their revenue literally went to $0 overnight, it was a no brainer play for the hedge funds. 
So they started borrowing millions and millions of shares from brokers and sold them “short” at the market price at the time, and they pocketed the cash from the sale. The idea is that the stock price will drop, you can buy them back later at a lower price, and then return the borrowed shares to the broker and keep the difference. If the company goes bankrupt, the stock goes to $0 and they don’t have to buy anything back at all and keep everything. This is what they were banking on. They’ve done this to company after company over the years, and they saw this as a sure thing as any. 

Well a bunch of people on Reddit (affectionately known as “Apes”) noticed they were trying to drive AMC, GameStop and many other retail brick and mortar stores into bankruptcy, and banded together to buy up all the available shares, driving up the share price. This resulted in the mini squeeze in January. But Apes didnt sell after that. And the hedge funds didn’t cover their short positions either (I.e. buy back the millions of shares they had borrowed and sold short). 

The Apes kept buying and buying, and holding and holding, and once the real shares were all bought up, the hedge funds doubled, tripled and quadrupled down on their short position and started making synthetic shares (IOUs) and selling those shares into the market trying to drive the price down. When the price dropped, instead of selling like the hedge funds wanted them to, Apes said “thank you very much for the discount” and kept buying more and holding. Nobody has sold for the past 5 months since the movement really got started in January, and more and more people are jumping in and adding more everyday. 

Now because of all of the synthetic IOU shares the hedge funds have created to keep shorting AMC, us Apes likely own more way more shares than are actually supposed to exist (as much as 6x-8x by some estimates). But real or synthetic, each share the hedge funds sold short is a liability on their books that must be bought back in order to close out their position. 

They literally have hundreds of millions of shares, possibly billions, to buy back, and we own them all. They have to buy them back eventually, and every day that the borrowed short shares are still on loan, the hedge funds are paying interest to the brokers they borrowed them from. Meanwhile it costs us nothing to hold. 

Things started to come to a head a couple weeks ago because the interest rate on the borrowed shares was reported to be as high as 250% (1-2% is normal for your average stock), so the hedge funds are collectively paying hundreds of millions of dollars every day just to hold their position, and a lot of them are starting to miss the payments and margin calls could be coming very soon. 

That’s when the fun starts. At that point, the broker forces them to buy back all of the hundreds of millions of shares they have borrowed and sold short, because the broker doesn’t want the hedge funds’ recklessness to fall onto them. And remember, the Apes own all the shares and aren’t selling. The hedge funds can only buy a share for what an Ape is willing to sell it for, and us Apes really love our shares. 

Once the margin calls start, the computers just start buying back all of the shares at the best available price no matter what that price may be. They all have to be bought back. Everything must be settled. And if the cheapest price an ape is willing to sell for is 1,000, or 10,000 or 100,000, well then that’s what the hedge funds will be forced to buy the borrowed shares back for in order to close out their position. 

Apes are going to hold and hold and hold driving up the price further and further to make the hedge funds bleed as much as possible until they are inevitably forced to buy back their millions of shares. They will need to buy our shares, and we set the price. And remember, it costs us nothing to hold. This movement has been building for the past 5 months, but you just heard about it yesterday. One thing Apes don’t do is set dates for the squeeze. Nobody knows when it will happen, all we know for sure is that the math says it’s inevitable as long as we hold. 

I only see three possibilities as to how this all plays out: 

1. AMC goes bankrupt and the hedgies win (please note this is not going to happen. AMC has enough liquidity to last them through 2022 and the most passionate shareholder base in the universe. Not to mention a pretty badass CEO who has completely embraced the new shareholder base) 

2. Hedge funds are somehow able to meet their daily margin payments to avoid being margin called, and they strategically close out their short positions over time, causing a sustained Tesla type squeeze over a period of a year or more (remember, apes aren’t selling until we’re at the moon) 

3. Hedge funds will be margin called and forced to buy everything all at once and we’ll have the most violent squeeze in the history of short squeezes. The price is infinite as long as apes hold.I wouldn’t bet on #1, #2 will require patience, and #3 will be absolute insanity (and in my personal non-financial advisor opinion is the most likely outcome). Either way, we’re winning the battle. This beautiful movement is growing by the day, and we can hold longer than they can. 

Never before has anything like this happened where millions of regular people have been able to band together to take on the billionaires who have been screwing them over time and time again, and be able to actually hit them where it really hurts. It is the big hedge fund himself on the other side (you know the one) who has his hands in all the retail brokerage apps to make sure our orders get routed to him to fill. And then they fill them with synthetic shares that they don’t even have and dig themselves even deeper. They created and marketed easy access to the stock market to the retail investor because they only saw the retail investor as prey. Just another way to bleed us dry. They never saw this coming. 

Like I said, everything will eventually have to be settled. Margin calls are coming. And the SEC has already enacted several rules to prepare as much as possible for the catastrophic fallout from this event, and to make sure that something like this can never happen again. The millions of little guys with an app in their hand are a threat now, and I’m sure they’ll adapt to it. So this could very well be a once in a lifetime opportunity here.

All TA indicators point to good news for $AMC, please find a flaw in my logic!

Edit 1: BOTS ARE DOWNVOTING THIS INSANELY!!! 

(Edit: added original edits from original post) 

Edit 2: Thank you everyone for the feedback.  Gives me a little more confidence that I do know what I ""think I know""

I am a 3 month old ape, who like most of you have turned this into a 2nd full-time job digging every night for DD, watching YouTube video after video, all the while getting a crash course in economics and the stock market.  I am posting this as DD for everyone else but also to see, but also I would like to see if anyone can find flaws in my logic.

**TL:DR: All signs look good, tell me where I am wrong**

For starters, let me say that I believe when you have a heavily manipulated stock, such as $amc, you have to be careful with the TA and not read TOO much into it.  On the flip side, I don't believe we should completely discount it either 

I drew a pennant flag on the daily candles with 3 ascending and 3 descending touch points.  The flag lines will converge in what looks to be another 7-10 days.  The ascending line starts right about the beginning of the squeeze in January.  The descending line starts from about 2 days after the initial run-up and subsequent trading halt by RH.  While a pennant flag is indicative in an upcoming movement one way or another, I believe the other criteria listed below strengthens the case for a bullish move upward.  

The Bollinger bands (dark blue) have become increasingly narrowed.  For those of you who might be unfamiliar:

*"" Breakouts – Bollinger Squeeze*

*When the upper and lower Bollinger Bands are moving towards each  other, or the distance between the upper and lower bands is narrow (on a  relative basis), it is a suggestion that the market under review is  consolidating.*

*A consolidation phase suggests that the market is non-directional for  the time being and now rangebound in nature. The narrow or narrowing  Bollinger Bands will essentially move closer to the price and at some  stage appear to be ‘Squeezing’ the price. It is at this stage that  breakout traders might pay attention.""*

src: [www.ig.com](https://www.ig.com/us/trading-strategies/what-are-bollinger-bands-and-how-do-you-use-them-in-trading--200129?&CHID=1&QPID=2934542669&QPPID=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwvr6EBhDOARIsAPpqUPFAvxgxwPr8z-OmrxPfB40MVN_RJ2l7v4m6UDcxmV9TP3WPildwk4QaAkT_EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) (It was the 1st google result for Bollinger Bands)

We are currently trading barely below the VWAP (Pink line) and AEMA (Light Blue line), which to me is not a concern due to the manipulation.  As long as we are in the pennant triangle, I would believe that not to be a big issue but would other opinions on this.  By time the convergence has hit, I would fully expect to be trading above those points.

&#x200B;

[3 Month Pennant Flag](https://preview.redd.it/xisbkjnpkyw61.jpg?width=486&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8ff63680b491bb031bba0bf92dd5bf457cd925a0)

The MACD (12 and 26) have currently converged and floating just above 0.  Based on the last 3 months of being above 0 combines with the pennant, I would expect this to trend upwards over the next few days.

The RSI is currently sitting at 47 (neutral).  This is the near the lowest the RSI has been since the initial squeeze in late January.  I interpret from that fact, that the stock does not like to below neutral for too long.  Aside from April 12th, every time it hit an RSI of 46, it bounced off like it was a resistance line.  (Am I misstating/misunderstanding that?) 

OBV has remained steady even with the trickery and manipulation, which again, to me is a great indicator that we are holding the stock and not selling.

&#x200B;

The volume flow indicator has been in a constant upward trajectory and is the highest it has been during the last 3 months.  Anything above a ""0"" is considered bullish and we are at 14.53!!!  If you are unfamiliar with it, please check it out [here.](https://www.thatsucks.com/volume-flow-indicator-following-the-crowd-isnt-so-bad/)

We know from all the youtubers, specifically Roencsh Capital, IV is extremely important.  The lower it is, the more likely we are to get ""Big Money"" on our side (AKA. Smart Money).  A few days ago we had an IV of 139%, and our barely above that today at 144%.  These IV level are the LOWEST for at least the last 6 months.

The [RateOfChange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricerateofchange.asp) is a trendline indicative of future price movement.  Yes, you cant guarantee future results on past data, but you can use it as a guide.  We are on a very slim uptrend, which to me is indicative of all the consolidation as of late.  I would expect this trendine to shoot upwards as we approach the convergence point of the pennant flag, if as I hypothesize, we are fixing to break out into good bullish territory.

[VFI, IV, and ROC](https://preview.redd.it/j8pjnyq2pyw61.jpg?width=486&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=506786faef095744c942322c18f0f3f6797e1d5b)

If you made it this far, BADASS!  Thank you for reading all of my DD.  PLEASE let me know if you find any holes in my logic or have other suggestions.  Like I said earlier, I am a 3 month old ape, so PLEASE PLEASE do not take this as absolute or 100% accurate unless you verify it yourself.  Invest wisely my fellow apes!  #ApeStrongerTogether #ApeNoHurtApe

Everyone is basically suing them for the same reason. There’s manipulation as well but let’s deconstruct this so that we don’t jump ahead of ourselves and end up stuck in a bathtub. 

&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

* Sherman Act - [https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/antitrust-laws](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/antitrust-laws) \- Basically this Act prohibits anyone from restricting interstate commerce and competition in the marketplace. You all know about this because you all saw Vlad declare every question to be a great question and that he is from a little town somewhere in Bulgaria. 

Now you might be asking yourselves what do these suits have to do with AMC specifically because they seem to clearly apply to both GME and AMC equally. Today for example, on the 24th of March GME dropped 33% and AMC dropped 15% so it’s likely the same manipulation is being factored into both. 

But we must keep in mind that these are 2 very different companies with completely different focuses. Now, while GME is making a lot of changes to their business structure and improving a great deal of the issues that were holding them back, that still wouldn’t support the price it is at now. If you take into account Sony, Nintendo, EA, Activision Blizzard or any other company focusing on gaming, their value has never reached heights like this. 

So…does this mean I’m shitting on Gamestop? Hell no! I love Gamestop and I have quite a few shares myself that I am holding until we’re all standing comfortably on the moon. My point in this, is that it is slightly more difficult to prove the illegal manipulation in Gamestop if we are just considering the volatility of the stock. 

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/stock-price-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/stock-price-history)

If you look at the history of GME, it has never hit heights that even come close to where it is now. We know the value of the stock now thanks to the WSB community and DFV but it is new and uncharted territory for the company. 

AMC, however, has maintained heights of somewhere around $30 easily throughout its history. 

[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/stock-price-history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMC/amc-entertainment-holdings/stock-price-history)

AMC has never been this volatile in its ENTIRE history. If you look into AMC it always dropped or increased slowly and has maintained a position that isn’t anywhere near the price of GME stock. So my point again, is that the manipulation in AMC is significantly more obvious and I would go as far as to theorize that it’s for that very reason why we aren’t just talking about GME. 

Hear me out here. 

The squeeze could’ve just been GME, could’ve just been the one company, but instead all these different companies for some reason also skyrocketed, all of which have almost nothing in common.

To further illustrate this I will list below, in order from highest to lowest, the percentage jump of some of these fortunate “random” stocks. 

On January 27th…

&amp;amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

1. GME shot up 1,622%
2. EXPR shot up 792%
3. AMC shot up 671%
4. BB shot up 243%
5. NOK shot up 70%

Now theoretically going by the percentage jump, AMC is not the 2nd highest so we should be talking about GME and EXPR but we’re not. I haven’t seen any EXPR posts at all and I honestly didn’t even realize they shot up as much as they did until I started doing the research. And I love Express which you would be able to deduce by looking into my closet. So why is it that the conversation became about GME and AMC but not EXPR?

This is why.

Need I go on? 

The value that AMC is at now is severely less than it should be given the direction the company is heading. You’ve heard all the plans from every Ape and YouTuber alike covering the topic. You’ve got TreyTrades, AndrewMoMoney, MaxMaher, Roensch Capital, New York Angelo, Tyler Wilson Investing, Invest In Success and so on. They have all covered the future plans for AMC and they have all taken positions in AMC. 

The reason for this is simple. AMC is the most promising and affordable Meme Stock at the present time. Not everyone has hundreds of dollars to throw into their investments and even though certain institutions like Blackrock hold the most shares, the greatest support for these stocks, the people who can’t stop talking about AMC, are the retail investors like you and I. 

Mostly every single person in this community can afford to throw in $10 for one share or buy 10 shares for every 1 share of GME. So for the love of the company, the ability to buy many stocks within a tight budget, the future plans, and the fact that they are reopening, they are the people’s choice. 

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/robinhood-has-a-new-most-held-stock-and-its-not-apple-or-tesla-2021-02-08](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/robinhood-has-a-new-most-held-stock-and-its-not-apple-or-tesla-2021-02-08)

AMC. The sidekick to GME. Or, as I would prefer to look at it, the Padawan to the Master. 

Now, again, I am left asking why would GME need a Padawan? Why do Padawan’s even exist? 

Are you following me now? 

I have to state this again because I really don’t want to divide apes between the 2. Both are incredible displays of power from the people. We’ve made powerful institutions so desperate that they are blatantly committing illegal actions in the market for everyone to see and that is not because they are untouchable. They will face penalties for this but they literally can’t afford to care right now. Consequences be damned, they have been cornered by WSB. By all of you. If you haven’t already, take a second to pat yourself hard on the fucking back please do so right the fuck now. Because you are part of a movement in the market that has never, in all of history ever happened. 

You brought extremely powerful institutions to their knees and they are begging for mercy, crying on air, spying on our forums relentlessly, calling in favors to manipulate the media and they are doing all of this because of you. 

Now if you’ll so kindly accompany me into a few other DD’s and Discussions so you can see some numbers that I know you want to see, the first one is mine…

I told you I like links. 

So let me clarify my position here and I’m going to edit the shit out of this so if anyone has any disagreements or concerns please address me immediately and if I agree I will adjust this DD accordingly while also giving credit to whomever provides the information. The same goes for anyone who thinks I may have left something out. 

I believe that the Padawan here will surpass the Master so if GME explodes and you beautiful diamond handed freaking apes continue to hodl until it reaches, lets say $10,000.00 a share, I think AMC would go as far as $12,000.00 to maybe even $15,000.00 a share. 

To provide some background into who I am, I have been trading carefully for 10+ years and I have made over 20k in all that time. It wasn’t much but I was a reserved trader and took extreme caution whenever I invested into a company. I held for long periods of time and stayed up to date with the companies I invested in. I had a very diverse portfolio and then WSB happened. 

My wife and I saw the Big Short on Amazon Prime which she loved even though it left her furious at the fact that the banks basically got away with it while regular working class people suffered. Then we saw a video on a YouTube channel called InTheMoney. 

[https://youtu.be/qRvKc-mY5s4](https://youtu.be/qRvKc-mY5s4)

She saw that video and she felt that feeling, those chills that comes when you finally see a powerful, unbeatable Villain get obliterated by the underdog. This is why we made the Attack on Titan video. 

[https://youtu.be/bUU502J6tlo](https://youtu.be/bUU502J6tlo)

After that, she convinced me to join the battle and my whole life changed. We started small and eventually I ended up moving ALL OF MY MONEY into AMC shares and call options. I am not a mad man or reckless. On the contrary I am extremely careful and paranoid about everything. Mistakes haunt me for months and I can honestly say, that I have never been a risk taker. I calculate and make educated decisions. And now I am a father of a one year old, I work at a Law Firm and I’m taking care of my Grandmother who will pass away soon so I’m juggling quite a bit here. More responsibility than I have ever had in my entire life. 

I have people who depend on me. So while I may have gone full retard here, I did so with the utmost confidence that this was a fight worth fighting and that WSB had changed the world in the best of ways. I believe that will continue and every dollar I put into AMC/GME is not just an investment to become stupidly fucking rich. I mean it is. My son deserves the word but it is also my faith that I am placing into WSB and the entire freaking Ape Family that I have come to love so much. 

I hope this serves to be a small contribution to a really great cause. 

I wasn’t going to share this, because this is mine, but I love this family and I have so much confidence in all of you that I will share it despite my desire to keep it to myself.  

My little sister passed away in 2019. She was 21 and I am still broken. I think I always will be. But I have faith that she is with me in every moment and that I couldn’t do this without her watching over me. I couldn’t do any of it. I fight with all of you and I fight with her by my side to show these powerful people that the world does not belong to them.

It belongs to all of us.",2021-03-25 02:04:05

How to Margin Call Citadel.,1620289351.0,"If you have recently transferred from robinhood to fidelity or any other broker you may have noticed that not all of your shares transferred across at the same time. 
Some people are saying that 75% of shares are available and the other 25% take a few extra days to be transferred. 
This is because robinhood is using the shares YOU PURCHASED to be lended/shorted. When you transfer brokers they have to find those shares: i.e a margin call on robinhood and therefore citadel, virtu, g1 and the other hedge funds that are shorting AMC. When you transfer brokers robinhood has to find the shares that you purchased and replace your IOU shares, with real shares. 
If you want the squeeze to happen then you NEED to leave robinhood. I understand it’s inconvenient and takes time. But you will not miss the squeeze. This squeeze will take days if not weeks to begin. The gamma squeeze alone has not yet begun. 
Let’s pull together apes and make this happen.

Edit: link to reddit post showing margin accounts when transferring from robinhood to other brokers. (Margin accounts: accounts and holdings that are purely made from ‘margin’ are effectively accounts full of IOU’s and synthetic shares).

ICC-2021-007 PASSED & APPROVED TODAY !!!!!,1621392525.0," ICC-007 has been approved today:

[https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-10498.pdf?utm\_medium=email&utm\_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list&utm\_source=federalregister.gov](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-10498.pdf?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list&utm_source=federalregister.gov)

This is bigger than ICC-005. This updates margin requirements hedge funds must put up required by brokers to maintain their positions in a trading account, and now the margin requirement can be increased immediately based on the volatility, price fluctuations with their assets (increasing risks in the market, such as risks shorting AMC/GME). These increasing risks could include a predictable short squeeze coming soon.

Mediators between banks and hedge funds are getting wary of the immensely high risks these hedge funds are posing to them.

Based on this ruling, if the account's updated margin (haircut) exceeds the account's capital, the broker can either margin call them or force liquidate their positions until the margin no longer exceeds the capital.

This ruling updates the collateral required for these overleveraged positions, basically they are further mitigating risks, in addition to what they put in ICC-005. Looks like regulators really aren't having it anymore.

They acknowledge in this filing that volatility may be extreme in the near future, and they do not want to be caught holding the bag.

In summary, ICC-007 ensures that even in stressed market conditions, the ICC will continue to collect sufficient collateral from its members and that such collateral could be liquidated in a timely manner to meet financial obligations as a central counterparty (mediator between banks and hedge funds).

ICC-005 was passed and approved just 3 days ago. Now ICC-007 got passed and approved today. Things are moving much quicker than I anticipated.",2021-05-18 19:48:45

Can we please agree to take care of AMC after AMC takes care of us?,1618528051.0,"I will personally be reinvesting heavily into AMC after the squeeze and I hope many of you do the same. I believe in the company, I believe in Adam Aron, and I believe that if he is looking out for us then we should look out for him.

Not telling anyone how to vote, but I personally will be voting yes because I plan to be a long term holder of AMC and all that would happen is flexibility to expand and having options going forward.

I see a lot of people wanting to vote no purely because they think it will ruin the squeeze potential. That's out of the way now since they promise not to issue any this year, and now I see a new argument of ""well they have 30 million shares they can use if they want to when the squeeze happens""-- that's true, but that's true regardless of if they get approved for the 500m and one could argue that they'd be more likely to use that ""against us"" if we're not supportive of them to begin with. Keep in mind having this proxy statement creates a share recall due to voting, that's a huge thing we've all been wanting and it could literally be the only way the squeeze even begins or occurs whatsoever; they're helping us here and for all we know that could be the entire reason they're doing a vote NOW rather than later.

Something that's bothering me not only because it's upsetting but also because it doesn't make a whole lot of sense is most of the people I see who want to vote no on the proxy are people who only plan to dump AMC after it pumps and think that voting yes will get in their way. It's sad because it's a bit selfish (which /was/ somewhat reasonable at face value but given AMC and Aron's history, I couldn't see it being a factor regardless), but it also doesn't make a lot of sense because with the new agreement it's off the table for getting in the way and those people don't plan on holding AMC into next year as an actual investment anyway.. so with the new agreement it won't even be a factor to them as an investor. I feel it's somewhat jeopardizing the company's fundamental future opportunities (again, not even a company you plan to be invested in by the time they're able to actually utilize the shares) but it's for a selfish purpose and the backing behind that purpose doesn't even exist anymore. Why should we expect AMC to help us if we won't help them?

The squeeze is important, but keep in mind underneath all of this is an actual company and that company seems to be on our side, so we should be on their side too. I see people in our AMC rocket who plan to jump out at the moon and let the rocket crash land somewhere else. Yes the rocket will crash, but we should repair it once we've safely gotten to our destination seeing as we couldn't have gotten there without it. If AMC makes us all rich then I would hope we all cradle the hand that feeds rather than biting it. 

Just my opinion. 

Again, not telling anyone how to vote. Regardless of the proxy I think we should all at least reinvest and support AMC once this is all done with. I don't want to see their stock crash back to earth and leave them stranded with high IV and people afraid to invest.

Detailed Explanation Why the 500k Floor is Mathematically Possible,1620689433.0,"&#x200B;

I hear too many apes saying even 100k is an unhinged fantasy. These apes are the logicians of the world and need facts and figures based in reality. Fair enough. Luckily I can back it up with left-brain data. 

My first point is, since when is any of this realistic? The hedge funds started this fever dream by creating an estimated 2+ billion counterfeit shares. THAT is what is completely unconscionable and *should* be impossible but that is another discussion.  For every redonkulous action there is an equally retarded REaction...it's, like, physics. Duh. 

The biggest flaw with the '500k CaN't HapPeN BeCAuSe ThAt'S 10x aLL ThE MoNEy iN ThE WorLd!!!' argument is that it usually comes from multiplying the 493,000,000 shares outstanding by $500k. Yes, that would be $246.5 Trillion, which is ridiculous because that would mean we shoot right up to 500k and every ape has days worth of opportunities to sell at that price point alone. **That is naïve misinformation and after this post it is shill FUD.** It is safe to say that there will be a run up and a run down with plenty of bumps in between, but definitely not a stagnant plateau for days/weeks right at $500k. Come on, we're retarded but not stupid!

# This is where the Geometric Mean comes in

[This link explains the Geometric Mean in more detail](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/060115/what-are-some-examples-applications-geometric-mean.asp#:~:text=The%20geometric%20mean%20is%20used,the%20compounded%20annual%20growth%20rate.&text=The%20geometric%20mean%20of%20the,%3D%200.046%20or%204.6%25%20annually)

Long story short, the geometric mean is used in finance to help calculate returns over time. Say you made $1500 off of a $1000 investment over ten years. How does each year break down, and what is the average per year? That is a similar situation to apes taking profits. **I cannot stress this enough, every ape needs to understand what the geometric mean is.** Save this post and direct shills and unconfident apes to it to educate them. I am fucking tired of hearing the asswipe argument that the payout would be more money than the entire world has.... #SpamGeometricMean 

Imagine, for the sake of argument, this is roughly what the MOASS might look like when we get our tendies:

[MOASS Price Action](https://preview.redd.it/b2g3gao138y61.png?width=818&format=png&auto=webp&s=d032aea6319c615366908728102cc95d78af3bd2)

&#x200B;

[Using These Plot points, for reference](https://preview.redd.it/e1w9iuoq38y61.png?width=244&format=png&auto=webp&s=69b98d2556f420b5152398d3ddd970e77f66a8da)

&#x200B;

This simulation peaks at $1 million and has all that area underneath the blue line that equals profits for apes who own the entire float multiple times over. Each of the points equals one of 21 time units that could be days, weeks, who knows. Basically, how many bricks make up the pyramid? There are far more in the first few bottom layers than the higher layers combined. 

Since I only have a few wrinkles, I am using [a geometric mean calculator.](http://www.alcula.com/calculators/statistics/geometric-mean/)

&#x200B;

[Geometric Mean of $11,273.08](https://preview.redd.it/4v0vgn9x48y61.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=dce8bb6174b08a8068da257b3e833984a5df5cca)

# So with that rough simulation of a peak of $1 million, the Geometric mean comes out to $11,273.08 per share. 

Now, there is no real way of knowing how many apes own how many shares until AA releases that on July 29th, but we can make a few guesses based on the verified 3.2 million ape figure and some data collected by our very own Matt Kohrs. Take it all with a grain of salt because it's just an estimate.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zjo3a4l278y61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e90fe8019ed6d6ed9ced8742c52d12e8c5cb86df

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/84qoi9n678y61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a5dbce7000ab240c9c2d95c14e2764b1031fa9d

NOT saying that that number of shares is accurate but it's backed up but solid logic. [Keep in mind, the total number of ape hodlers is much, much higher.](https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/n6e07c/the_ape_army_is_greater_than_10_million/) So again, for the sake of argument, we multiply the $11,273.08 by the 2,673,000,000  shares owned by apes, that comes out to **$30,132,942,840,000. It could always be much less than that of course.** 

# *Just* $30 Trillion! But where does that money come from?

1. Citadel and friends have trillions in assets by themselves. 
2. Brokers that should be held responsible for the trades that happen on their platform can feel the pain, too. They are complicit in naked shorting if they allowed us to buy counterfeit shares. They have several billion as well. 
3. The Federal Reserve has never shut off the money machine anyway. You're kidding yourself if you think the US doesn't give themselves a blank check whenever they want. 

Most importantly, [The DTCC is insured for $67 Trillion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01J85T5OAbM). I **REPEAT, the DTCC is insured for $67 TRILLION. The world economy is $130 Trillion...lol.** Let's not get any ideas about bankrupting the world! Or maybe...?

So that is just insurance. I am speculating here, but my ape-y sense is tingling that **the fed will strongly encourage our friends at the DTCC to increase that insurance significantly when this heats up because 'an insurance payout' looks much better on paper than 'printing money.'** There is blood in the water. [The NSCC passed 005 to increase member premiums from $10,000 to $250,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mz9gl6/nscc2021005_has_been_signed_today_implementation/), still waiting for SEC approval. This is why I think they are getting ready to increase that $67 Trillion.

Something important that never gets brought up in DD's is the fact that once the world economy starts taking a tumble, rich people will still be pouring money into everything while it's all on discount. There will come a time when it seems like it all hit the bottom and investor confidence will go back up, basically financial CPR for hedgefunds while they are on their way out. That money will once again find it's way into the Black Hole of STONKS, and can go towards our payout. **By wealth transfer, we mean all of it.** 

# It just seems too good to be true... What about the GME Payout? Their floor is $20,000,000 FFS!

GME has significantly less shares outstanding and likely nowhere near as many counterfeits but I would love to be wrong about that. :P Another ape did the GeoMean on GME and came up with an **estimated payout at a PEAK of $20,000,000 that comes out to $4,743,375,000,000.**  [u/raught19 breakdown of GME's GeoMean payout](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9td6w/estimations_for_the_total_payout_of_gme_based_on/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It's a little outdated because the peak is their new floor, but you get the idea. 

# Conclusions and Reminders

Hedgies R Fuk. 

Buy & Hodl. 

Selling on the way up is for sociopathic cunts. 

Bleed them dry. They were ready to bankrupt companies and put tens of thousands out of work during a pandemic. All these big players created a racket, and we need to make this epic to teach them a lesson and make the markets more fair for everyone. Blockchain, PFOF becoming illegal...one can dream. 

Tell your recruits that are not obsessive reddit lurkers to go VOTE VOTE VOTE. Everyone here and new apes buying in now have until June 2nd to call their broker to get that voting information sorted out. The new vote will take place on July 29th but you can vote before then. A massive number of apes with an unimaginable number of fake shares could be the catalyst we need to rocket.

Citadel claims on their own page that they process over 25% of all market trades, and close to 50% of all retail trades.

https://www.citadelsecurities.com/products/equities-and-options/

**Our automated equities platform trades approximately 26% of U.S. equities volume across more than 8,900 U.S.-listed securities and trades over 16,000 OTC securities. We execute approximately 47% of all U.S.-listed retail volume, making us the industry’s top wholesale market maker.**

In this post: https://old.reddit.com/r/Wallstreetbetsnew/comments/m6xehe/robinhood_the_missing_link/ - I talked about how RobbingYourAss and Citadel are engaging in CFD-like activities; legally floating orders to close at better prices, if you will. I believe Citadel's annual report just solidified that, in my mind.

*Note: Understand, I'm not exactly talking about rehypothecation or naked shorting of any individual company here... I believe he's issuing short shares ""legally"" under his Market Making abilities... *

-----

Citadel's plan is to route as much of retails orders through its system as possible, and issue a short share for whatever trade is sent to them through a retail platform. 

70-90% of retail trades lose money. By issuing a short share on the trade instead of locating a real share to transact, they are simultaneously ""providing liquidity"", while also betting directly against retail. It used to be a hugely safe bet. It was making money both ways. They collect free money on the share sale, make money by selling off the short positions in a bond (more on this in a second), and make money by the separate entities holding the short positions while Citadel Securities continues to drive the price down.

But then retail won a bet. And not just one bet, but they won multiple bets simultaneously. In late January, multiple stocks spiked at the same time: Gamestop, Nokia, AMC, BlackBerry, etc...

----

THAT is why Citadel had to shut down trading, and why RobbingYourMum only shut down trading on specific stocks. And THAT is why we just heard in the last congressional hearing directly from the DTCC, that the DTCC did NOT raise margin requirements and cause a halt to any trading. 

Citadel, as the market maker for 50% of all retail trades, was short on positions that were processed through RubbingYourCuck... and every single position went up huge at the exact same time. Citadel was caught on the line for every single short position that they created and that was held by RibbedCondom users.

And they still are. 

They were providing liquidity to retail the entire time before the squeeze at the pre-squeeze prices. 

And yes, I already hear you: ""But those short positions could just be their daily market making activity and completely normal in a day-to-day operation.""

The truth is: It doesn't matter.

-----

It only matters that those positions existed before the squeeze. The initial run-up happened so fast that there was no time to reverse their positions. The prices went up by multiples in a single day. Any short position they held, they were now locked in to.

And that's assuming that every share purchased *during* the run-up, also wasn't just short shares going out the door. Citadels page states:

""Our automated equities platform trades approximately 26% of U.S. equities volume across more than 8,900 U.S.-listed securities and trades over 16,000 OTC securities. We execute approximately 47% of all U.S.-listed retail volume, making us the industry’s top wholesale market maker.""

Automated.

If they had the automated system programmed to create a short position for a percentage of all retail shares routed to it... THAT explains why trading was completely shut off. The system was just generating short shares the entire time, and Citadel was (and is) the one on the line for all of it. THAT is also why they allowed selling and not buying. It allowed them to try and purchase back their shares at the same prices they shorted them at, with no buying interference. 

Know what the best part of all this is?

That $57,500,000,000 was what they had on the books as of 12/20/20... it doesn't even count what happened in January.

-----

Kenny, my man... Exactly how deep are you right now?...

If Citadel executes 50% of all retail trades, and there were 800,000,000 trades on GME alone between Jan 21 and Jan 29 (https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME)... how many of those 400,000,000 shares did you short to provide liquidity, Kenny? How many did you cover?...

How many are still owed after exercising all of your options for the last 4 months?

Is that why Citadels corporate bonds were rated BBB-? The absolute lowest rating you can get for investment grade bonds? Is it because your updated liabilities page looks like a raging dumpster fire?

That is why Citadel keeps being called out by name in the congressional hearings and being asked if they should be allowed to fail. Because I now firmly believe that Citadel is the ultimate bagholder of all of this.

-----

Remember, not only did Citadel bail out Melvin to avoid the margin call dominoes from falling, Citadel Advisors also personally lost over 3% of their worth in January alone (what was reported): https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/here-are-the-hedge-fund-winners-and-losers-amid-januarys-gamestop-mania-2021-2-1030034341

Citadel Advisors showed $234bil in AUM in 05/01/20: https://aum13f.com/firm/citadel-advisors-llc

(Remember, Citadel Advisors is separate from Citadel Securities)

If they lost 3%, that's $7,000,000,000 in losses in January alone, not counting the Cohen bailout.

So how do I think Citadel Advisors and Melvin Capital wound-up holding short positions created by Citadel Securities if there is supposed to be a firewall between the two of them? By re-packaging the short positions and selling themselves collateralized trust bonds. Crazy Melon (u/sydneyfriendlycub) has a very well-written group of posts about it here: https://old.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/n2hjnk/33_the_ultimate_dd_guide_to_the_moon_crazy_melon/

Citadel Securities would sell short positions to facilitate liquidity on retail trades, and simultaneously bet against retail. Citadel Securities would package those short positions in Collateralized Trust Bonds, and sell those bonds to Citadel Advisors and Melvin Capital. 

That would get the short positions off of Citadel Securities books, effectively ""covering"" them, and allow them to show FINRA a lower short position holding. They then use their Market Maker status to continue issuing shorts on a stock like GME, causing the price to fall, and the short positions of Melvin and Citadel Advisors to go up in value. It was an infinite money glitch, until retail won a trade.

-----

Want proof of more insider fuckery? 

Explain to me how Melvin just filed an amended report, showing that he magically found a holding position of $121,500,000 worth of PUT options of VIACOM from December, right after the Archegos liquidation happened?

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571821000618/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml

I'm sure that the SEC finds that reporting those puts 4 months after the due date is completely normal... considering the circumstances.

Sorry to cut this off abruptly, but I'm tired and the screen is going hazy. Time for ape to sleep. If I tie anything else together, I'll be sure to break the tin-foil hat back out later.

If I got anything wrong that you think needs attention, lemme know so I can edit it. I like my conspiracy theory, but it doesn't mean its 100% correct.

❌I expose the hedge fund connection with the big time MarketWatch hit piece on AMC today! It’s worse than you’d expect! (I’m a lawyer so I know my DD) ❌,1619740659.0,"By now we’re all suspicious of any hit piece that comes out against AMC, but today’s major (and oddly lengthy) MarketWatch opinion hit job has some curious connections to hedge funds. Link to MarketWatch article (4/29/21) in case you missed it:

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/should-you-buy-amc-stock-these-analysts-say-not-at-any-price-11619697643

So, like many of you I’m reading that MW opinion article today and wondering “Why would anybody — let alone 3 authors — write such a length article against AMC today?” The lengths the authors go to tear down and shred AMC was almost comical. Such detail like somebody maybe had an axe to grind against the company and it’s reddit shareholders???  

I’m not even going to get into some of their analysis which is purely speculative or questionable, it’s the impact of publishing negative pieces like this that had the impact. People just see the headline and are spooked. That’s the goal of course. 

Whelp, I did some digging and the guys who wrote it all work for a company called New Constructs. (No secret. It’s mentioned at the end of their ridiculous opinion article.) The interesting thing, however, is their company’s connection to hedge funds. IN FACT - they’ve run their own hedge fund focused on short selling strategy AT THE SAME TIME they were running New Constructs and publishing advisory articles about the markets! 

The CEO of New Constructs is one of the article’s authors and oddly enough was also the Managing Partner of hedge fund Novo Capital at the same time they were running anew Constructs. 

David Trainer, CEO New Constructs LinkedIn:
https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidtrainer 

I even found one of their fund offering reports from 2014 which discusses their short strategy. 

https://www.newconstructs.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/NovoCapitalMgmt_1Q14_LetterToInvestors1.pdf

To make matters more interesting, in the above report their law firm is named and what do you know, when you DD the firm who are there clients?? HEDGE FUNDS on Wall Street! You can’t make this up. One of their partners was even quoted in an article mentioning Citadel. Now we don’t know who their specific clients are but it doesn’t really matter because they’re a capital markets/hedge fund law firm based in the hedge fund holy land NYC.

TL:DR — we know AMC hit pieces are sus but today’s article on MarketWatch really takes the cake! Yes, they label it “Opinion” but why publish it today? Why such a lengthy, detailed article? Why would they care so much about AMC for some reason? 🤔 Cinemark also has a ton of debt yet trades around $21 and is subject to same pandemic impacts as AMC. Hmm. No hit pieces there. We all follow the short info for AMC so we know the MOASS is getting closer and so do they. Today’s article shows apes just how desperate and fuckt HFs really are. They’re bleeding every day and have clients to answer to for expected returns. We don’t. We have each other. Rather be on our side of the equation!

This is NOT Easy Money - Please Read.,1621525780.0,"A lot of new Apes are joining thinking this is easy money. Let me start by saying we welcome all the new Apes, since the more the merrier for us. But the way people have been talking about this is condescending to say the least. They're thinking of this as a get rich quick scheme. 

This is NOT Easy Money, contrary to what you might think. And I'll tell you why: 

1. Opportunity Cost: A lot of us have invested our entire portfolio into one stock - AMC. This is an opportunity cost decision we chose to take. For every single day we are not putting this money in another stock, we are losing out on gains we could have made on those. So this is not easy.
 


2. David vs Goliath: We are up against some of the most powerful entities in the financial world. It is not an easy war. We go on a battle every single morning, despite all the blatantly fraudulent activities carried out by them. 



3. Emotional Strength: Many of us undergo frustration, dejection, anger, and despair when we see the cheating done by HFs everyday to drop prices through naked shorts and high frequency trading. Even though the price action logically does not support falling share prices, we still bear it all and gulp it down. This requires a lot of emotional resilience that we're showing every single day. 

All in all, this is everything but easy money. 

But we are in this together. And we will take this thing to its deserving conclusion. We will be talked about in history.",2021-05-20 08:49:40

"To everyone celebrating the damn near certainty of this squeeze: THIS IS NOT EASY MONEY. THIS IS NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. This squeeze will be one of the hardest things you have ever done, and you need to be prepared for that.",1619706735.0,"If this is going to work, absolutely none of us can sell before 100k, not even to cover. Will one share stop the squeeze? ""Obviously not,"" but if you're willing to think that, so can everyone else. NUMBERS are our leverage, and with our numbers, ""**just one share"" can easily be 150k shares.** And that's an *extremely conservative* estimate.

**DO NOT WORRY, WE HAVE YOUR BACK**

Ape together strong. Many of us are inexperienced, but our biggest shareholders are all silverbacks who are ready for tricks, and know to sell on the way down. The 100k floor is a consensus, and you have to have faith beyond all reason that we are all in this for you, as you are for us. *Just to be clear, a floor means that we sell only if the price goes down* after *100k. A Trailing Stop Loss Order is perfect for this.* (only once we've reached our floor, if you set one up before the squeeze you risk selling early)

**YOUR INVESTMENT IS NOT AT RISK**

Even if you miss the entire squeeze, this stock will not disappear. You will probably double your investment regardless of anything. There is nothing to cover. Just millions of dollars on the line, for you and everyone in the ape family. *And all you have to do is ask for it.*

**AND IT WILL BE HARDER THAN YOU THINK**

This is absolutely huge. Trillions of dollars are on the line. This will be on the news, everywhere, and a lot of people aren't going to be happy about it. They will say anything they can to dissuade you, to turn us against each other. They may even turn your loved ones against you. I'd expect to see FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt based propaganda) like ""financial terrorism,"" ""hostile foreign investors"" ""economic depression,"" big names literally begging you to sell your stocks ""for the sake of America!"" Trust the DD. They can afford this. Insurance alone will cover trillions, and every penny will come from the pockets of over-privileged billionaire criminals. *This will make the world a better place for everyone.*

**YOU NEED TO BE PREPARED TO SEE TENS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FLUCTUATING IN YOUR ACCOUNT**

There is only so much they can do, but they will do absolutely anything within their power. And billions of dollars in assets is a lot of power. It's easy enough to say to yourself now that you will hold, but actually having that much money at your fingertips, and watching it go down, will be unlike anything you've ever experienced. Even small dips will translate to thousands. *You need to look at your account as if every share is already worth 100k.* *The* only *way you ""lose"" money is if you sell it for any less than that.*

**EXPECT PRESSURE FROM EVERY SINGLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION YOU TRUST. EVEN HERE**

""The squeeze is over,"" ""sell while you can"" ""I sold all my shares and made millions!"" Imagine you're reading this at 10K a share and the price is going down. Really feel it. *And fucking blacklist those words from your brain*. You will see this all over reddit, discord, facebook and twitter; they can pay thousands of desperate people to say these things, and possibly dozens of big names in the world of finance. They may already have paid people to invest and paperhand at 1k, 10k, trying to force a dip and more FUD. When this takes off it may be genuinely hard to find any information you can trust. And for those who've never experienced a squeeze, it could be a living hell. APE TOGETHER STRONG. Even if you can't see us, we are right there with you. We have your back. *You've already read all the information you need, trust it, no matter what you hear during the MOASS. 100k WILL happen. It might even be a good idea to tune out and set a price alert if you feel discouraged.*

And no matter what, never forget just how small (relatively speaking) your initial investment was. Not a single person is coming out of this a loser.

This important post is being taken down. All credit goes to u/beebsgaming,1621474737.0,"A Theory of Everything AMC: Wanda, AMC, the SEC, and Lawsuits

Disclaimer: Everything that is about to follow is speculation. It is purely a theory of mine based on known facts and common sense. Any dates included are to provide context. They do not indicate the beginning, middle, or end of the impending squeeze.

Disclaimer #2: I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, I just really like this stock.

TL;DR- Wanda, AMC, and the SEC are working together to build a case against the major short sellers committing blatant fraud daily that is suppressing the price of AMC stock. Wanda and AMC will stand to make a lot of money in lawsuits for capital losses. Meanwhile, the SEC will be able to prosecute fraudulent entities using information shared by AMC.

TLDR TLDR: HOLD


The Players:

Wanda America Entertainment- Before February of 2021, Wanda had voting stake in AMC and was the single largest institutional shareholder of AMC. In early February 2021, Wanda converted class B common stock to class A common stock, which allowed them to sell shares on the open market. On March 19-20, 2021, Wanda sold 15.6 million shares of AMC stock, reducing their holdings from 8.8% of AMC common stock to 6.8% of AMC common stock. Pay attention to those dates

AMC Entertainment- Led by CEO Adam Aron, AMC has staved off bankruptcy during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have raised a total of 752 million dollars from direct offerings in 2021. That is in addition to the funds raised in december 2020. This influx of capital has put AMC into a position that they can maintain operation at current levels until the end of 2022, per their Q1 2021 earnings call. The first dilution of 2021 put an additional 63.3 million shares on the market. That was completed on January 27, 2021. The second dilution was the ATM offering program that completed the sale of 43 million shares from April 27 to May 12. Remember these dates too.

Securities and Exchange Commission- As the lead regulating agency for the stock market, the SEC is supposed to legislate, investigate, and prosecute any entity committing securities fraud. We vilify them, and rightfully so. They have taken a sideline seat and watched as we battled back from our own 1 yard line to be 1st and goal today. Their only interest in all of this is to mitigate the effect on our economy as a whole and to prosecute the offending parties. In order to do that they need evidence. Not just evidence of when and what (dates, naked shorting amount, illegal FTD resets, etc), but also the WHO. We all have our sights on Citadel, but they are not the only complicit player here. This is systemic and market-wide. AMC and GME are not the only securities affected by this, but that are the most public. They are also the ones that can provide information that the SEC desperately needs.

The Game:

Remember when I said to pay attention to the dates before? Well, lets dig into those.

January 27- This was D-day for the HFs. We had them cornered, a squeeze was imminent. Share price rocketed to over $20 a share, trading halts comprised most of the market hours, brokers weren't allowing people to buy, and Apes were throwing shit all over the walls with excitement. Marge was dialing. During all of this, at the peak of all peaks, with us getting ready to get out of the atmosphere, AMC announced the 63 million share dilution. The following day, AMC plummeted to the 10-14 range, and started its descent back down to $5 a share. Why would they do this now? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

March 18-20- On March 18th, AMC is on the rise. We are about to break a critical resistance level at $14.50. Intraday, we break that wall. We are all watching patiently to get our tendies out of the fryer. It feels like January 27th all over again. Then, March 19th comes and instead of going up, share price drops. Not as heavily as on the 27th, but it doesnt continue the upward trend. All of a sudden shares available to borrow goes from 0 to millions. Apes are confused. It doesn't make sense. We broke the wall. it's time to move. Maybe it's just the last breath of the HFs before they let it run and Marge calls. March 20th rolls around, and again, the share price drops. This time, we crash below the $12.50 support level. In the following days, we come back down to the 10-11 dollar range, where we sat until the end of April. We later found out through 13F filings that Wanda sold 15 million shares, stalling our ascent and bringing us back down to earth. Why would a company who stands to gain billions from a squeeze do this? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

End of April 2021- Once again, we are on the rise. Not quite to the $14.50 break point, but we are in a streak of green days, shares available to borrow are almost gone, and cost to borrow is skyrocketing when they are available. It feels like January and March again. We're getting ready to break 12.50 and gap up to the 14s again. Then, AMC announces its ATM offering program. Once again, from the 27th of april through the end of May, we drop back to the 10-11 dollar range. We found out at the Q1 earnings that during this period of descent, AMC had sold over 15 million shares onto the market, raising a significant amount of capital. Once again, we plummet back to earth. Why would a company sacrifice billions in profits off of the ATM offering to sell all of it's remaining sellable shares at 9.50-10.50 a share? It doesn't make sense until you read below.

Where are we at today- Once again, we are getting ready to break the resistance levels, and shares available to borrow are somehow appearing out of nowhere. Borrow rates have dropped 75 percent in a week, and every time we push that level of resistance, we get pulled back down. Does this sound familiar? I think Wanda is unloading another block of shares. This is horribly bad for us right? Can't be good? Wrong. This was always the plan, it was always the game. They're adding shorty rocket fuel. FOMO is kicking in. Retail is seeing a huge increase in liquidity as new buyers join in for liftoff. It is the perfect time to drop shares if you are intentionally delaying the squeeze. Those shares are gone almost immediately. Literally, if they sell at open, even the full 30 million would get eaten up in the first hour of trading. In order to figure out why they would delay the squeeze, we need to look at the playbook.

The Playbook:

AMC and Wanda's goal throughout these last 5 months has been to build a case for the mother of all legal claims against the entities short selling the stock with synthetic shares. Each time we reach a breaking point for the good, they are keeping the SP down as they gather the information they need to file a lawsuit. I graduated with a political science degree, with the aim of going to law school, so I have a decent amount of knowledge when it comes to legal proceedings. Having said that, this is what you need to prove damages in a civil lawsuit.

1.) Who- Who was the offending party that caused the damage?

2.) When- During what period or at what time did they cause you the damage?

3.) How- What did they do that caused you to incur damages?

4.) Damages incurred- You need to be able to define the amount of loss incurred due to the actions of the offending party. In this case, its a pecuniary damage (money lost).

The plays:

1.) Share count- In order to identify the who and the how, AMC needs to be able to prove which entities wronged them, and the amount of damage EACH of them caused. IE, how many shares did they short using malpractice? (naked shorting, FTD resets, etc) The share count does this for them. In order to disseminate voting materials, they need to know the information of who owns the shares of stock, how many they own, and have the contact information to send out voting materials. This gives them the who and the factor to multiply damages incurred per share against.

2.) Delay annual meeting- I firmly believe AMC delayed the meeting because of the sheer amount of shares they counted. The last thing a company wants to do is go into a critical vote with an inflated number of shares. In order to get anything on the ballot to pass, they need a majority of shareholders to approve. If the amount of shares and votes is inflated, they could potentially see all of their ballot items fail to pass.

3.) Involve the SEC- When they knew the who and amount of shares, I believe AMC got the SEC involved. They were able to provide concrete evidence to the SEC of the fraud that was ongoing since December. The SEC needed that information to file legal proceedings. Keep in mind, they need the same things AMC does, minus the damages incurred, to bring a case against the malpracticing firms. At this point, the SEC can actively watch the actions of the offending parties in real time. Building a case until the next share count. In addition, this gives AMC the ability to follow with a civil lawsuit using the SECs findings as the How of their claim. Here's the bonus, the SEC will be able to show AMC the how during the time of the 43 million dilution. These illegal activities were going on during a share dilution, directly affecting the share price AMC should have gotten for their shares sold.

4.) 2nd share recount- I think the SEC advised AMC to conduct another recount for a few reasons. 1.) the illegal activity ramped up from Janurary to April, and the actual share count would have undoubtedly increased in this period, and 2.) It allows the SEC to track another data point while getting ready for the market implosion this could cause. It also delays a notification to the public of just how broken the system is. Now, when AMC announces the share count, the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will pursue, naming the defendants.

5.) Timing of dilutions- If AMC diluted during or after the squeeze, they wouldn't be able to correctly identify damages incurred and when they occurred. By having Wanda and AMC dilute when share price was not inflated, it gives a concrete timeframe of when they were damaged, as well as a count of shares that form the basis of the damage claim (15 million for Wanda, and 103 million for AMC).

4th and Goal (how it ends):

On June 2nd, AMC has to finish their share count so they can disseminate materials. Adam Aron has already stated he will make the share count public. When he announces the total shares counted, it will clearly show the blatant manipulation and illegal activities. Retail will FOMO, institutions will FOMO, and large private investors will FOMO. If you want confirmation that this was the end play, look for an announcement of a share recall, a formal investigation, or both with the announcement.

When they recall the shares, the MMs will need to get real shares, and only real shares, back from the HF before the date specified. This will ignite the margin calls and form the catalyst from the squeeze. The squeeze will be squoze, in theory. (Again, no dates, shhhh)

When the squeeze is over, AMC can now identify just how much they were damaged. They now have the who and when (share recount), the how (SEC investigation), and the damages incurred (delta between share price at market offering and top of the squeeze). A civil lawsuit will follow.

At any point after June 2nd, the SEC can announce the legal proceedings it will have and identify the offending parties. Here is the beauty, they can file for an immediate injunction to take control over the offending parties assets. In fact, this is common in legal proceedings involving malpractice. You have evidence the offending party is committing illegal acts, so you stop them from continuing them during legal proceedings.

Confirmation bias time: Why would Wanda and AMC sell shares pre-squeeze? Remember I said you would find out below? Well buckle up. Imagine the shares you have now, and knowing that you could get the maximum gains possible (the top of the top peak), for your shares. That is the position AMC and Wanda have put themselves into. it is honestly genius if you really think about it. They don't have to time the sales. Just watch it go, and when the dust settles, they can name their price from HISTORICAL FACT. I think we would all take this option. AMC and Wanda stand to make billions from this from the way they have played this game.

Thank you if you made it this far. This was a labor of love and took some time. If you disagree with the above, any of it, let me know. This is just a THEORY. It makes sense though, doesn't it?!

There’s google searches that are popping up with #yourmovesec and riots. They are trying to paint us as a bad guy collective so that they have an excuse to shut us down. At this point, government intervention is Citadel’s only way out. Don’t give them the excuse. 

Mods *need* to see this. We hold the winning hand. All’s we need to do is buy and hold, it’s that simple. 

BUY AND HOLD 

DO NOT FORM A COLLECTIVE

STOP SPAMMING THE SEC

❤️ all you 🦧’s

AMC 💯K BABY!!! TO THE MOON!!! 🚀🚀🚀

Edit: Do you see our long whales (Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard) spamming the SEC? No, you don’t. We all need to be more like them. Our long whales are waiting PATIENTLY, and so should we. The pieces are all already in place. The only thing spamming the SEC does is put a spotlight on our collective ignorance and unprofessionalism. It puts a target on our back. Ever heard the saying loose lips sink ships? 

One day, there will be a time to put a spotlight on all this manipulation and corruption. But today is not that day. They are looking for any excuse to shut this down and blame retail, and online movements like this can be weaponized against us.  Don’t load the gun for them. We can beat them at their own game. They made the rules.

Remember: ALL SHORTS MUST COVER. 

Oh and don’t forget: BUY AND HOLD!!!

We’ve already won.

BLOW THIS UP!!!!,1620241373.0,"

I haven't seen as much talk about this, yet it is the biggest news to come and the endgame catalyst.

NSCC-801 Passed with no objections Tuesday.

For this rule to enter effect it needs to piggyback on NSCC-002, which if no objections are made again, will be passed this Friday.

Let me remind you just how powerful 801 is...

Once 801 enters effect, all hedgefunds holding short positions will be monitored every single minute. They will have to report every single minute their value in short positions versus their actual money on hand. If they fail to report or their short position value crosses the threshold where it is higher than their money on hand, it's an immediate warning to deposit the funds needed to cover within ONE HOUR. Failure to do so leads to the NSCC immediately overriding operations and liquidating the hedge funds entirely, one after another until all that is left is the trillions in insurance.

This is bigger than anything. This is so big, that this rule will prevent a squeeze even a fraction of this magnitude happening ever again. It is that powerful, and with its implementation at this stage of the game... good lord. The fact this isn't at the top of all posts is mind boggling. 

If NSCC-002 passes this Friday, we have entered the squeeze. Hedgefunds will be on a leash that gets tighter the more they pull. 

Starting in after hours and following into Monday, they will be under so much pressure and restriction that one of two things will happen:

Their ability to short will be at such a minimum level that our buying power will just break through their sell walls and the price will just continue to rise and rise until they can no longer afford to suffer the loss on their end and be forced to cover.

The other outcome would be strong final blows of sell off aggression and shorting, literally out of pure ignorance and recklessnes which will activate 801, and thus the great fall of the hedgefunds via margin call.

If 002 passes Friday, 801 will catapult us past relying on chart patterns, earning reports, share counts, and whatever else Adam Aron has up his sleeve.

This week is a setup beyond everything. Share holder meeting moved back to give confidence to hedgefunds to short harder until the earnings report on Thursday. This week is a setup and lowkey a bear trap to get the price as low as possible and then bring a ridiculous wave of new buying force after the earnings report with new buyers ready to eat up that final dip. All of this leading to 002 passing on Friday which would just destroy any uncertainty of a squeeze for AMC. 

To conclude, I want to remind you that 801 going into full effect not only relates to us... but the 100+ other stocks these hedgefunds have short positions in. If just one of those stocks like GME pull ahead because of 801 it will be a domino effect like never seen before. 

I am going to run through a wall Friday if 002 passes.

That will be the true beginning of the end.

Buy as much as you can this week. I expect the lowest price to be on Thursday around noon before the earnings report. Hold. You hold like this will never happen again in your life because if 002 passes I can assure you, that will be the case.

This is not financial advice. Not my own dd.. but needed to be shared

Practice your breathing because when this takes off...
Sheesh.

Do you think I am fucking scared right now? Lol. I have eaten losses my entire life. I eat losses for breakfast. 

Just so you know I have fought through loss and pain my whole life and through all that I made something of myself. I am now an Electrical Engineer and I make good money. I can take care of myself. Money is not the issue for me. What is the issue is all the people I see here who are in dire straits and this is a hail mary attempt for them to even have a chance in this life. People who are sick and people with sick kids.

And what do you Hedgefucks do? Same as you've always done. Commit to destroying any halfway decent company and run a way with tax free dollars. Even after your last stint fucking up the housing market you were paid in MY tax dollars to walk away free and clear. NO! If you fuckup, you pay. That's how it was for me and that's how it's going to be for you. 

My new goal is to spend the rest of my life buying AMC shares. I can afford to purchase 1000 shares each month. 

THIS STOCK IS NOW GUARANTEED TO MOON.

I have now committed my life to making sure it happens. It's not for me anymore. It's for all those people suffering who NEED this. No matter what happens, I will keep buying more shares. Short the shit out of this stock. Bring it to it's knees. I will eat the losses from here on out and KEEP BUYING SHARES. It's  mooning. I'm not leaving it to chance.

Message to new apes huge info drop/cheat sheet.,1622487701.0,"

First off I’d like to say welcome to the Ape family. Happy you’re here to join us in this battle. I would like to take some time to give you a big info drop / cheat sheet of some OG Ape knowledge. 
There’s groups on Facebook there’s Instagram Apes and we’re all over Twitter. Twitter is also a good idea for fast info a lot of great people to follow I’m @Brittan19865518 I try and tweet info on short squeeze updates and keep positivity in the community.
Here we go- in no particular order.  

- Stop losses are not recommend for a short squeeze. They try and pick low hanging fruit 🍉 🍎 🍌 and will trigger a drop and you don’t want to lose your shares that would be heart breaking. We all take time and love and money to collect what we have and to ensure that is safe I highly recommend not setting stop losses. They will try and rob you for what you have because it’s good as gold. Stop losses are not recommended for situations like these.

- 500k is not a meme and totally possible! There is no cap on how high a short squeeze can go.  There are infinite losses for them and it cost money every day for them to short the stock. It cost nothing for us to hold. Every share has to be bought back. This is basically a ransom situation where we get to name the price because we own all of the shares.
- Link reference: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/08/short-squeeze-profits.asp

- What is an Ape 🦍🦍🦍? We are a new party on Wall Street we are not bears 🐻 or bulls 🐮 we are retail that are reforming the stock market in a “planet of the ape.” Sort of take over. Apes together are strong we need to stick together in order to accomplish this. We may not be professionals but there are many of us. 3.2 million and counting. This is a global movement there are apes all over the world. Together we can accomplish greatness. 

- When will my gains come (Tendy time) 💰 🤑 💰 well in due time. All things great in life are worth waiting for buy and hold. Those are the main rules that everyone needs to know. Gains will come with work and time there’s good days and bad days ups and downs do some of your own research too and stay true to your convictions. Anything you question look up on a search engine and read many articles to put things into perspective. Ask and don’t be ashamed we are here to help you can also message me with any questions and I’ll do my best to answer them. We call research DD which stands for due diligence. 💎 🧠 we need everyone working together to find the best info available. Share anything you think could be of relevance you’d be surprised how much everything is connected.

- Why do we hold? Well there’s many reasons. For our fellow apes, for our dreams and stories. Every ape has a reason. Mine personally is I’m terminally ill and want to be able to afford a house and some cushions for my family and make preparations, to help do my part in going against the hedge funds who are political lobbyist and  monopolize everything (monopoly is bad.) to help create a better tomorrow. To donate to my favorite causes and make real change in lives. To be able to go out to eat and leave someone a life changing tip. To be able to be a part in giving back faith in dreaming big and the magic in life where we can accomplish big dreams if we work hard at it and persevere though the good and bad the possibilities are endless. (I recommend looking up the “Ape philanthropy page so you can see just how big some of these ideas to change the world are it’s heart warming.) I also would like to be rich 🤑 

- Don’t fear the dips eat them. 🥘 this is kinda like a game of hungry hungry hippos 🦛 you eat up the shares and hold them. Pretty simple rules. It’s also kinda like Pokémon you want to try and collect them all and every time you buy shares that’s hit points being taken away from the enemy. Like every classic turn based RPG game. We’re fighting them with money and we’re doing so effectively. (That’s super effective 😏) -100 hit points matters and fractions or smaller or bigger amounts add up too. It takes all of us buying and holding together. We should hold so people who can’t afford much can still make live changing money. This is the way!

- Trust the process. There’s tons of data and the numbers are in our favor. This is going to be a part of history. We own 84.32% of the business. We have taken them over by acquisition. Yes that’s right. You’re buying a part of a company that we all own together as Apes. They’re still shorting and borrowing shares and this battle is not over. It’s just began.  Make sure to also do your own research and stay true to your convictions.  Cannot stress this enough. Use your search engine of choice and any questions you have look up from multiple resources and have fun learning. There’s also of info out there if you ask all of the questions.

- What is a gamma squeeze? 
In short it has to do with options plays and a big reason why Friday’s are a big day. Hedge funds are afraid of gamma squeeze (this is not to be confused with a short squeeze) they generally fight hard to short the stock every Friday like clock work. This is our boss battle or mini boss battle war for the week. Gammas can cause the price to soar. That’s a good thing and we generally try to get many options to expire friday market open specifically in the money or out the money. (More on this later.)

- Why it’s so important to vote on your AMC shares. They’re trying to expose the synthetics which by technical terms are called “phantom shares.” They have a connection to failure to delivers. They dilute the stock price so take the numbers you see with a grain of salt. We own this bitch and we’re going to make some money no getting out of it. They naked short the stock (which is illegal activities.) the proof is what they pump out on the market generally using OTC or Dark pools professional name is Alternative Trading systems every brokerage has one. If we buy the synthetics then we hold them as shares and still get paid for them. What we don’t buy goes to the failure to deliver pile. We must vote whatever you vote is just please vote.  They’re doing this for a share count to expose the illegal activities and blatant market manipulation. If you see a huge “sell off” know it’s FAKE and they’re trying to trick you.

- Expect a bumpy ride. This is not a get rich quick scheme and may take some time. The markets have ups and downs and you have to Hodl (hold on for dear life) through them. It’s like Surfing 🏄‍♀️ 🌊 in a raging ocean you have to hold through the good and bad days until we can all reach our goal with 💎 🙌🏻 (diamond hands) Ride the waves of the market through the extreme highs and the extreme lows of prices they’re going to fluctuate. I was stuck in the red for months averaging up and down and it takes time and patience to get there. When your portfolio is red know it’s their blood you’re seeing and not yours. Buying the dip lowers your average price and helps you get a great discount! Who doesn’t love a discount? You also may get lucky and just jump in at the right time. But things won’t always be ☀️ 🌈 🍪 🍌. It’s hard honest work and sometimes it can get stressful but know the end game is worth it!

- If you’d like to look into more advanced research I highly recommend looking at “the house of cards 1-3 u/atobitt

- What are options? They’re basically a side bet if you think the stock is going up or going down... I highly recommend you don’t do puts because they effect the sentiment of the stock which in turn effects how easily the price goes up and down... (these are generally for more advanced traders but you can learn by watching YouTube videos and doing deep research from several different searches.

- There may be breaker halts during the squeeze this is normal and something you should know about...
- Link:  https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/circuitbreaker.asp

- Historically squeezes have a 50% drop before they but in. Diamond hands... this will be their last ditch effort to shake people off before the squeeze but also it’s hard to tell because we have been buying the dip. It may not happen but just Incase it’s nice to know. Keep reading for stock market psychology.

- What is a float of a stock? These are the shares issued available for buy on a stock... that number for AMC is specifically 416.64 Million (legal original) shares available. We own the float and institutions and hedge funds own about  15% were sitting really pretty here. Every share has to be bought back.

- I suggest a decent broker do your research Robinhood was caught robbing the hood and has ties to citadel. (More on this later) not all brokerages are created equal. I personally use Moomoo and Fidelity. But I trust the bigger brokerages a lot more. Transfers are fairly easy and usually don’t take much time. I’ve done two of them and the average is about 3 days. Robinhood charges a 75$ fee but sometimes you can email the brokerage your transferring to and get the fees waived. A lot of other places do not charge a fee for transfer so make sure you read the fine print and research 🧐 
- Link: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/robinhood-stops-gamestop-amc-stock-trading-1565122%3famp=1

- Don’t put in more than you can afford to lose. Be financially responsible make sure you only YOLO (throw all your money in) after bills. Make sure you can still afford rent and food and take care of yourself and family. This is a given but I’d like to stress don’t throw everything in and end up in a financial titanic no one knows when the squeeze will happen for sure. Anyone who tries to put a date on it is full of shit. It may be this month it may be months or more away... this could be a long or short game so prepare it may take time. Rome wasn’t built in a day and we cannot just do this over night although it’s been over half a year on the making. 

- Shorts have not covered in fact they’re still actively shorting every day. You can check up on how many shares are available to loan and short with by going to this link.
- Link: https://amc.crazyawesomecompany.com highly suggest book marking this info. 

- Again do your own DD (due diligence or research) just some ideas on what I like to study personally... history of short squeezes. History of stock market crashes (1920s is lit 🔥) economics in general. Who is shorting the stock... who is the owner of that company (Ken Griffin of citadel is a popular one) ask all The Who’s what’s where’s when’s how’s and why’s. You’ll find some great shit.

- To get an idea of who is shorting the stock and to figure out deep diving into dd and info check out the link provided. Anyone with puts on the stock is shorting and here’s a list of hedge funds and institutions. The ones who don’t have puts are the good 🐳 whales we have hedge funds and institutions who are also in this war with us. Not all info is current but it’s my go to site.
- Link: https://whalewisdom.com/stock/amc-2

- Major news 📰 media 📺 is not to be trusted a lot of it is a lie. Market watch and Motley fool (to name a few) are both owned by hedge funds and spin their own narrative. You’ll see the tv spin a won’t narrative too. Always try and research an article and double check. The hedge funds use media and news outlets to play mind games don’t give in to their FUD tactics (fear uncertainty and doubt) 

- What if the shorts don’t have money to back their positions? Well the dtcc is a clearing house that has insurance on everything to make sure we get paid and they have over 70 Trillion dollars to back shit up. Trillion with a T!

- https://www.dtcc.com/news/2020/november/23/dtcc-launches-pilot-program-for-new-insurance-information-exchange-platform (it’s even more since this came out.) 

- Who is the SEC? Well they’re the cops 👮‍♀️ or Wall Street and there’s a new sherif in town named Gary Gensler and he tends to be on the side of retail. Government investigations can take quite some time I bet he’s on their ass.

- Gme why it matters? Deep fucking value is a genius and with out his influence none of this could be possible. GameStop is a phenomena and we owe respect to the dude. Originally Wall Street bets made fun of him and said he was crazy but dude knows his stuff. Watch some of roaring kittys videos to see what the future of AMC might hold and what to expect. Their story is not over as well. We’re in the same battle Apes are all over retail. 
- Link for GameStop info: 
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze

- AMC is not all Wall Street bets and sometimes they can be mean to AMC investors... it use to be a friendly place where all apes once got along but the old mods who had nothing to do with anything took over for fame and glory and movie rights. They kicked all the good mods out and the thing has been compromised for a while. I was an original member who got kicked for writing something about AMC after the old mods took back over.

- Shills and bots 🤖 ... these are legit things you will notice a flow of them sometimes block it out. Shills are paid for going on social media and spreading FUD and trying to get retail to sell. Don’t fall for the crap. 

- Ask vrs Bid... it’s always best to buy the ask if you can with your brokerage account. We refer to this as “Slapping the Ask.” It’s better for the price movement of the stock.

- Another very important think to understand is market psychology. They will do anything they can to shake you off so you don’t profit and sell at a loss. Go back and refer to trust the process. Never sell at a loss. We all know what this is worth!

- SEC rules and what they mean... I saw this on a meme and I am not copying it word for word but here’s the gist...
- Dtcc-2021-002- makes it harder for hedge funds and institutions to borrow short shares and fucks up their chance to become over leveraged in short positions.
- Dtcc-2021- 003- Dtcc can check in on hedge fucks whenever they feel like it.
- Dtcc-2021- 004- there are no safety nets for the hedge funds if they’re over leveraged the plug gets pulled and they’re margin called. When the stock rises to a point they can’t afford bye the fuck bye to their position they gotta pay up.
- Dtcc-2021-005- No more trading back and forth. 
- Dtcc-2021-801- The margin call... ☎️ 
- Otcc-2021-003 (related to 801) They’re raising capital you have to have on hand (liquidity) margin is currently at 150% for AMC so they have to back positions by 100% plus half more. 
- Otcc- 2021-004 it’s easier to bid on options from suspended members if they get a margin call ☎️ basically cannibalism of eating each other alive. Turning on each other.

- If you have a margin account switch to cash account! Turn off your share lending. It’s different for specific brokers but you can YouTube your specific brokerages or do a search on the search engine of your choice to figure out how to make sure you stock is not borrowed by the short sellers. It’s not an automatic thing in most brokerages. Something that’s worth looking into.

Don't blow it.

I am 52, been working 30 years and have what almost everyone would agree is a successful and good life. And what did it cost? 

My life, my freedom and my independence.

And you know what would not have changed anything? $5,000 or $10,000 or $25,000. 

You have the *one* chance you will ever have, unless you are born rich, to gain that life you want, that freedom you want, that independence you need. You cannot have those things as a wage slave.

Ever.

I know.

What I wouldn't have given to have the opportunity as a young man that you have now. 

And what a horrible regret it would be to be me, at 52, to have had that one opportunity and blown it because you were afraid of the risk.

The real risk isn't the $1,000 or $500 you invested in AMC. It's ending up like me, but having had the chance to avoid it. 

And blown it.

It will be tempting when AMC hits 500, or 1000 or even 10000 to sell. You will bullshit yourself that you need the money. Or you want a car. Or owe rent.

Do...not...give...in...

You will regret it. Badly. And for decades, if you miss out. 

I have never had this chance until now. I am lucky enough that I can lose my AMC investment and barely blink. But it took me 30 years to get there. 30 years of shitty bosses, paying bills, commuting, hectoring, missing out. 

*30 years of quiet desperation.*

Here is your chance. Your one chance to avoid the *real* risk.  

If you sell that chance for a 500 or 5000 or $10000, well enjoy the rest of your life. Because that money won't make a difference at all.

Do not blow it apes. 

Not for $500 or $5000. 

Go all the way. And if you lose, well thems the breaks. But that chance is a whole lot better than wage slavery. 

Hold.
And when you want to sell.

End game is here ... $50 - $75 Friday and then comes the attack ... Be prepared.,1622056929.0,"We know the $50 price point has been brought up by shills before and now we're seeing Lou get spammed with ""sell Friday for $50"" shilliness. We also know that the shares that will be counted June 2nd are the shares that are owned at EOD this Friday.

So where does that leave us?

We are going to see mass media coverage starting today probably, crediting Reddit investors and claiming the squeeze has squozen. We'll see $50 Friday, maybe tomorrow, and then .... BOOM ... SSR ... Media shift.

They want to hype us up and force a sell off Friday to drop the share count. 

At this point I'm not convinced they have enough ammo to left to bring the price down artificially and, although I don't understand options and shorts all that well, you'd have to be a full blown retard to make a short bet against AMC now.

We're in the end game. The noose is tightening and there only way out is to force us out. HODL until at least 6 digits but for those of you that that will inevitably paper hand, you've wasted your time, energy and effort if you sell before June 2nd.

"The real possibility of a $100k floor, what needs to happen to get there, what will prevent us, etc. EASY DD for newer people to the page and the market.",1619125875.0,"Edit: There have been a TON of awesome questions, comments, follow ups, etc. If you enjoy this post I highly recommend actually reading the comments too. A lot of good follow up answers and DD there as well. 

Good Morning fellow apes, 

I figured I'd do a quick, easy to understand DD on how the $100k floor is possible for newer apes who just got here and just see a bunch of memes and capital letters which although motivating, doesn't really give them info or make them feel better. Also none of this is financial advice, I'm stupid af so don't listen to me at all. SO here it is: 

**Basics:** At a very simple level, you need to understand the stock price is dictated by supply and demand (ignoring ALL manipulation that we know about which negates all of it but anyway).To put it simply there are a certain amount of shares per company. If people are buying the stock, demand is high so the value of it rises. If people sell the stock, the demand for it is lowering so the price decreases since there is now more supply. Good now that you understand that. 

I won't go much into the short positions, HODL, etc. I'm assuming if you're here, you understand that the stock is shorted into oblivion and that they need to buy their shorts back for whatever price we dictate and that's how you found all of this. Good, moving on. 

THE IMPORTANT PART.

How we get to $100k and above in two easy steps:

 Wait = They MUST buy back all shares shorted. Since they keep creating fake shares to continue shorting, this number is unknown however what is known is that they must buy back ALL of them. It doesn't matter if it is 1,000,000,000 shares and 1/3 of them never existed in the first place. They knew the risk and continued to do it and it is inevitable. It may take weeks, it may take months (although I honestly think we're near the end game). This is the reason the stock will sky rocket because they'll just need to keep buying and buying therefore doing what to the price? INCREASING IT. Good job, you get an A. 

 Hold = We need to HOLD our shares and not sell them until it reaches its peak. Again, supply and demand. If the price is going up and people start selling then that hurts the increase because more are becoming available. That could slow down the pace and momentum and ultimately if enough people sell all their shares could stop the squeeze much lower than its ceiling. Also if you don't sell your shares for the asking price then they increase the asking price. It's that simple. All you really need to do is wait them out. THEY have no choice, YOU do. 

Things that can fuck it up:

\- Selling too early. **Retail investors, people like you and I, own almost 92% of the shares.** That means we hold by far the most power. If we all hold together then we all win. The scariest part will be large institutions selling huge amounts of shares at a time, to either day trade for profits, or exit their positions. This can drop the price A LOT if there is not a lot of volume. But at the end of the day we hold quite literally almost all of the power. Do not get scared if you see a 5%-10% decrease in a short amount of time from day traders and institutions. Have faith that everyone is holding with you. We are. It'll be hard to see $10k a share and millions in your account. At the end of the day, do what makes you comfortable and sell at a point you're happy with. We don't know what this will go to, high or low.

**I'm going to bolden this next point because it drives me up a fucking wall to see everyday...**

**DELETE YOUR FUCKING SELL LIMIT ORDERS. I DON'T CARE THAT YOU PUT IT AT 100K OR 1MILLION. THIS SHOWS THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO SELL YOUR SHARES THUS DECREASING DEMAND FOR THE STOCK. EVERY LIMIT ORDER AFFECTS THE STOCK NEGATIVELY REGARDLESS IF IT IS TRIGGERED OR NOT. THAT IS WHY YOU SEE HUGE ""BUY"" ORDERS BELOW THE STOCK PRICE FROM HEDGE FUNDS THAT GET DELETED BECAUSE IT SHOWS DEMAND FOR A LOWER PRICE. IT DOES NOT WORK THE SAME WITH SELL LIMITS. SELL LIMITS ALWAYS DECREASE THE PRICE. STOP FISHING FOR KARMA BY MAKING A POST THAT YOU PUT IN $100K AS YOUR SELL LIMIT. SET ""PRICE NOTIFICATIONS"" IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHEN IT GETS THERE.** 

Also a side note, stop comparing the share price to Berkshire Hathaway. Their market cap is $630B with 1.26 mill shares, AMC's is $4.3B with about 450million shares. 450x the amount of shares with less than 1% of the market cap. It's not even close to a real comparison and I really don't want inexperienced people holding thinking it'll get there and losing everything they worked hard for.  Just be careful is all I'm saying. It's great to show that a stock can get there but explain that it is not a comparison if you're going to post it for hype. 

Above All, I know I'm going to get shit for this, but sell where you are comfortable. I suggest staying on these boards, staying up to date, informed, etc. and pull out where you think your life will change. That is the ultimate goal. I have faith the majority of people will hold until infinity, I know I am. 

I might not get upvoted because I'm not screaming HOLD YOU PUSSIES, and instead I'm telling you to be smart. I want all of us to win and that comes at completely different levels for everyone. 

I love you all. Let's get these fucks.",2021-04-22 14:11:15

2. AMC shoreholders will VOTE on May 4th to see, IF AMC has the right to issue upto 500M more share. Not issue them ONLY the right to issue. (most expect this measure to fail)
3. In the off chance if that vote passes. AMC has to hold another share holder meeting and **ANOTHER VOTE** to actually issue the shares and be very specific on how many those shares are going to be.
4. Diamond Hands

They should be easy to spot, because there's quite literally (which is a word I don't use lightly) only two kinds of people in this sub... Apes who are fucking stoked on the stock, and are holding bananas for a moon ride to get an assload of tendies.

And shills/trolls/HF cunts/haters/cock thistles who need a swift kick in their tiny dicks.

NOTHING in between, FUCKING NOTHING. Two types, that's it.

Edit 9: APES =dont let them downvote this...it is under heavy attack and all it is, is information...
I have been curious to see what the Premium version of TV would get me, so I bought it.  Mainly because I've been wanting to see my charts at the 1 second interval.  First stock I've looked at on an interval less than 1 minute in over 15 years, and BOOM, one look at AMC's last hour shows everything about the machine trading going on.

The question is when US, the retail investors begin holding these institutions fully accountable and forcing them to end the robbery that is Trade Date + 2.  The DTCC is responsible for allowing this, and they should be corrected immediately.  This is the biggest financial entity in the world.  It is going to take every. single. ape.  to make the change we need to have safe markets to invest in.  This is a call to action apes.  Every Ape should be PISSED!

Edit: TLDR = Not a Dead Cat!!

Edit 2: Some Apes requested comparisons.  I'll give several...  One's highly shorted, then ones that are more bluechips...

Blue Chips requested:

Edit #4:  and for comparison, let's look at a real penny stock and how it trades through BARCODING, every single day:

EDIT #5:   another TLDR:  We basically see that it is happening on every single one of these charts.  Some have so much regular volatility, that is is hard to see IE: MVIS, AAPL, MSFT....but even chevron, you can see it...  when you zoom in, you can see it on every single stock in the stock market.  So algo's, to me, aren't bad for the market....as long as EVERY APE has the right to the same trading advantages.  Which we do not and never have.  This goes all the way up to the TOP of the food chain. edit 6:  readability.",2021-04-30 21:38:48

Let’s be perfectly clear. (Read me NOW),1619998170.0,"I’ve been here since early December. I started on WSB when GME and AMC were $2-$5. And moved here when WSB fell. I’ve seen 6 months worth of manipulations, fud, and shill tactics. 

LET ME MAKE SOMETHING ABSOLUTELY UTTERLY FUCKING CLEAR!

When GME and AMC had their first massive gamma squeeze on Jan 27(I’ll never forget that day) WSB was basically exposed and the BOTS and SHILLS invaded the page. They overtook the page with posts about SELLING because the squeeze is over and taking the small profit or a loss. And when I say invaded, they came by the 10’s of thousands and posted nonstop(every five minutes) about selling and that we lost and we can’t win against billionaires and blah blah blah. (Sound familiar?)

ITS NOT TRUE. NOTHING HAS CHANGED. THE NUMBERS STAYED THE SAME. THE DD ONLY INCREASED IN POSITIVITY. WE WERE STILL IN THE WINNERS CIRCLE. 

WE WERE WINNING! And they knew it and the bots and shills are a clear sign that we are winning. These werewolves (Hedgies) they operate in patterns. They never give up on these patterns. It’s the same thing over and over and over. It’s predictable. And trackable. 

IF THE BOTS ARE OUT FULL FLEDGE TELLING YOU TO SELL: please understand that that literally means we are at the tipping point. We’re about to win. We’re about to squeeze. It’s the pattern rearing it’s ugly predictable head.

I don’t care how long you’ve been here. I don’t care if you have one share or one million shares. You’ve been through the manipulation and ladder attacks enough to know they’re desperate. 

So use these “sell on Monday” posts as the strongest motivation possible. There’s no way to know what day the squeeze will begin on our end. But ON THEIR SIDE?? They have a timebomb in front of them and it’s ticking down before their very eyes. They know it’s coming and when it’s coming. They’re scared and using everything they can to make people sell. They’re even bribing ape leaders and youtubers, using illegal tactics, hoping it’ll cause some sort of doubt. Even if they get one person to sell, they win back millions of dollars. 

SO SEEING THESE POSTS ABOUT SELLING ON MONDAY, stay motivated, stay strong, stay holding on. If you need help stay positive and staying away from the sell button, reach out to me directly or one of the veteran apes and we will help you stay strong. WE WONT GIVE YOU FINANCIAL ADVICE, we won’t tell you what to do. We will only give you motivation and data and sources to go to in order to stay strong. Because apes are strong together. We need eachother to win. We stay the course, we hold on, and we will create the biggest transfer of wealth this world has ever seen. 

So don’t be afraid or surprised if we see $5 this week (I doubt it’ll hit that low but still). Don’t be sad. Don’t doubt. Don’t fear. In fact celebrate that win. That’s a fire sale. If anyone is selling (which I doubt) and the price hits $5, I’m buying twice as many shares as I already have to make up the difference. I won’t let my ape community suffer. Even if I eat almonds for lunch all week and have to go without my morning coffee (God forbid) I will. Because this community deserves the squeeze. I love each and every one of you. We are in the final stretch guys and gals. 

We hold on. We support one another. We love one another. We resist temptation. 

And WE SLAP THAT ASK! No more limits. 

This is the way. 
We are the apes

"My floor is not 500k, 100k, 10k. It is 1k",1619517266.0,"As an xx,xxx shareholder, my floor is at 1k. What I mean is I won't sell when it goes up to 1k, 10k, 100k, 500k, or to millions. I will sell when it comes back down to 1k after the peak. This is so all the x, xx, xxx, xxxx shareholders can take their tendies who need it most for their wife, husband, kids, family, and friends. I've been lurking around this community for a long time and I've seen what millions of dollars can do for everyone. So therefore my floor is 1k. I encourage all xxxxx holders to do the same. Happy hodling everyone.

Edit:  Hi, it's me again. A lot of people in the comment and DM asked me for proof so here it is

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m3yt3ud6unv61.jpg?width=1632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ad7b7533e697916b33c4950549f12da3f0b46d49

A little backstory... I'm a 24 years old South Korean (part of the Korean Kstreetbets) who immigrated to the US to study. Might be wondering how this young guy got so much money. My parents stayed back in South Korea because of their job and they both passed away years ago from a car accident while they were going on a vacation. Well... their lawyer and corporation sold my old home and sent me half the retirement, life insurance, home money back to me. I didn't know I didn't get the full amount and even if I did, how was I going to fight them back? I have no siblings and I'm an orphan. Even though I had money, I was so lost and lonely until AMC happened. Lurking around the subreddit, I found peace and motivation to live another day. Seeing all these posts about how this money can help their family and friends gave me hope. As others have said, Yes I am retarded for not selling at the peak and taking all the cash. But my mom taught me money can't buy happiness and I can see what she means now. Greed for money will bring more problems. We all have different reasons for hodling. I'm not doing this for the money, I just do it for all the people in this subreddit to have financial freedom and it feels like I'm getting back at my parent's corporation. I will hodl and hodl until everyone gets their tendies. Because that would truly bring me happiness :D. Also, me selling at 1k would mean I have $49,787,000 which is plenty for me haha.

Also, I'm Korean so you bet I'm gonna win this game with them hedgies :P

"After watching my boy Trey today, I feel like this needs to be said… 🦍💪🚀",1621567787.0,"**Listen up Apes! This is OUR time! Whether you realize it or not, we are all activists and this fight has just begun.** 

When I bought my first shares at $14 back in January, I didn’t do it because I thought it would get me a Lambo or a trip to the moon. I did it because it was finally a chance for us, the little guys, to stick it to the man on their turf. We all know that they have been using the market to keep the rich on their thrones since the dawn of time and even since us small money “retail investors” have been allowed to play on their playground, they have been rigging the game and shaking the lunch money out of our pockets. This is the time for us to collectively fight back and stand up for something that is right. 

Just think how far we have come… fucking congressional hearings have happened. The SEC is passing new rules because of this shit. We are finally getting some attention from the media, although they are still painting us to be silly little children way out of our league. Hedge funds have crashed and burned, some guy jumped off a building for god’s sake (I’m not applauding anyone’s death, merely pointing out the high stakes at play here.) This shit is serious, it’s real, and it’s happening as we speak because of the collective effort of APES!

I want to see the moon as bad as any of you do. I want to be financially secure and quit my job and do something I really love. I want to save the movies. I want to party with all of you Apes in Vegas when this is all over. But above all, I want to tell my kids someday, regardless if I’m rich or poor, that I did some cool shit for the RIGHT reasons. I want to teach them how to stick up for that kid on the playground that gets bullied. I want to teach them that sometimes the underdog can win. I want to teach them that community, family, and love is more important than money, greed & fame. I want them to know that conviction, education, and hard work can win over privilege, entitlement, and cheating.

I’m not going to sugarcoat this part, and it may get me downvoted to oblivion, or called a shill but it needs to be said. The market is risky as fuck. It doesn’t matter if you’re invested in long-term proven stocks like Apple or Amazon, or you’re playing options, OR you buy AMC hoping for a squeeze. There is never a guarantee of gains. Risk is inherent in every trade, some more risky than others, but you can lose a lot or all of your money in the market. The market is a brutal place. Now, I wouldn’t have bought into AMC over and over again since January if I didn’t believe in the stock. There’s tons of really good DD in this sub, on YouTube, on Twitter etc. Do your research and make your own decision but think twice about investing money you don’t have, or your rent money, or your student loan payment. It doesn’t matter what you’re investing in, you should never invest money that you cannot afford to lose, period. Please, I can’t state this point enough. Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose. That said, if what you can afford to lose buys you 4 or 4000 shares, it all helps the cause and hopefully we all get big juicy extra tasty crispy tendies.

So, to all the Apes out there. Stop whining about when the squeeze is going to happen. If your buddy told you to buy AMC last week and that you would be driving a Lambo this week, you obviously didn’t do any DD and had shitty advice. Just because we’ve had a couple of red days doesn’t mean anything in the larger scheme of things. More Apes are buying every day and that is where we gain the upper hand. Collective power. This could be a very long battle and one that we will only win if we stay together and HOLD. Some days this shit is just too emotional and you need to stop looking at the ticker and watching YouTube videos. Go for a run. Get laid. Do whatever you need to do to get your mind right. It’s only going to get harder and harder and if you can’t handle it now because AMC delayed a share a vote or there are more shares available to short than there were yesterday then you're not prepared for battle. Whatever is getting you worked up in the moment, harness that negative energy and put it into something positive and start to learn some discipline, train your mind so that when shit gets really crazy you are mentally prepared. Redirect that frustration into learning more about the market, how it works, and educate others. This is activist investing and we will change the world. Apes strong together! Be positive, hold the line and I will see you all on the moon

STOP UPVOTING MEMES AND PICS OF THE SAME EXACT ONES AND START UPVOTING THE IMPORTANT DDS AND POSTS!

The time has arrived and we need to put on our game faces and be ready and be aware of what’s going.

There will be a time during the squeeze that this sub will be taken down or infiltrated by bots and shills. So we need all 💎🙌🦍 understand the current events and what’s going on. LAST THING WE NEED ARE MORE PAPER HANDS BECAUSE THESE INVESTORS DONT UNDERSTAND THAT THE FLOOR SHOULD BE $1,000,000 AND NOT $100!

LESS MEMES AND SELFIES AND MORE DDs AND IMPORTANT POSTS DURING THE WEEK. The weekend, everyone can have fun.

AMC to $1 million

Edit: If you’re wondering why this is important, let me ask a few questions. Because if the sub gets taken down during the squeeze or if bots are everywhere, are 🦍 prepared?
1. Do you know about trading halts due to volatility?
2. Do you know what margin call is and long it takes?
3. Are you still using Robinhood? A transfer to Fidelity takes 1-3 business days.
4. When the squeeze begins, do you know when to hold, buy or sell?
5. Do you know to stop day trading during the squeeze because not all orders will be filled?
6. Do you know the floor? 100K is not a meme. 500K is not a meme. $1 million is not a meme. These are possible due to 💎🙌🦍.
7. Have you voted for the proxy and know why it is  important?
8. Do you know the squeeze will last days and potentially weeks?

These are important questions, if you you don’t know all the answers, then are you really ready for the squeeze? The squeeze will be the most difficult thing and the most emotional roller coaster you will ever experience.

Edit 2: Adam Aron, the CEO of AMC, tweeted there are over 3,000,000 shareholders. The float is around 418,000,000. Which would mean the average is around 139 shares per person. This is a conservative calculation as I’m not including institutional investors that own AMC.

Edit 3: I’m not an expert but I have had experiences with short squeezes. I was in the Tesla short squeeze a few years back and I was in the January mini squeeze where Robinhood and other brokerages restricted people from buying. The emotions you will go through is times 100%. When you’re in the middle of the squeeze your brain lapse and your mind is running on pure emotion and adrenaline. You will not be thinking as logically unless you take a step back, take a deep breath and stop look at the ticker. Anytime it dips, your mind will be telling you the squeeze is over and take your profits, no matter what your goal was. I paper handed the Tesla squeeze. While I made a good profit, I missed out on thousands of dollars. And let me tell you, that feeling is the worst. Worse than losing money. In January, I was more prepared and this time my 💎🙌 held. I saw AMC go up to $20, saw the Robinhood BS and saw AMC dip to $5. I held through all of this and continued to average down. Now we are getting close to the LARGEST SHORT SQUEEZE IN HISTORY! Even with my experience, I may still not be well prepared. But I know the data, I know my floor, and I know there are 🦍 around the world that I can trust. AMC stock is PRICELESS. AA confirmed there are synthetic shares. Anything is possible if you believe and the squeeze will really test if your hands are 💎 or paper.

Edit 4: I’m not saying to stop posting memes. I don’t mind memes, I enjoy them. I’m talking about the same ones over and over and over again. However, during the week, I think we need to start posting more DDs and informational post. More 🦍 needs to be aware. The weekend, y’all can go crazy. Shit posts everywhere. Spy on citadels building 4 in the morning in a Sunday. I don’t care. But we are getting close, and it’s important for every 🦍 to be ready. Because once it starts, everything will be crazy. I guarantee Reddit will be down, youtubers will be down, Twitter accounts will be suspended, discord’s will be down. Be ready for the fuckery.",2021-05-05 14:27:04

After the squeeze everyone should buy back in at their original positions,1618171955.0,"After this thing goes tits to the moon I am going to buy back my original position after the price regulates. Or more positions if I feel inclined. Let's let the CEO know that we are regular people that have human emotions. We've seen these regular people donate to charities and spread the wealth already. Let's let him know that we are here to back up the company that changed our lives. I will be buying back my original position at the minimum and hold it until I die. Us apes need to scratch each other's backs and take care of each other. It is how we got this far. With unity the impossible becomes possible, and the possible becomes unstoppable.

"When squeeze happens, if I see a post complaining can’t sell on RH and asking for advice what to do, I will down vote right away.",1620598575.0,"Title says it all. After all these shenanigans, if you are still on RH, you don’t deserve the MOASS.

Edit:
OMG, this has exploded. 

To be clear, this is not to bash on RH users. Feel free to keep on using it. Just don't complain when you can't sell because there has been numerous warnings. 

There have been a lot of questions on the how/risk involved with transferring out of RH. I made a post but here is the gist of it. 

## FAQ

 * Why transferring out of RH?
   * Because you want to be able to sell when squeeze happens. Because you want to secure your profit for you and your family. Because best to transfer out was yesterday and second best time is today. Worst time is after squeeze happens and you finally realize you lost your once in a life time opportunity and you want to sue them. 
   * In their end of user agreement, they already say they can halt your trading. So you likely can't fight it back legally. See what happened to doge here, https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/mzv341/if_you_are_using_robinhood_to_trade_doge_you_are/
 * If I'm transferring out of RH, what are the good brokers out there? 
   * The popular one is Fidelity. Disclaimer, I'm a Canadian so I have no experience with Fidelity. Personally, I have my shares spread in 3 brokers. Apes have been accumulating a list of good and bad brokers here,   https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk/comments/mknaao/call_to_apes_the_apesourced_guide_on_broker/. 
 * What are the easiest way to transfer our RH if I'm using Fidelity?
   * From what I see from Reddit posts, the easiest way is to call Fidelity and they will setup transfer for you. For real, just call them. They will be more than happy to take another customer. Here is a post with instruction, https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m77idn/psa_how_to_transfer_gme_from_rh_into_fidelity
 * If MOASS happens when I transfer, will I be able to sell my shares? 
You will not be able to sell. That is the risk. But we need to compare the risk here. 
   * IMO, if you stay on RH, the chance you will be able to sell on RH when MOASS happens is less than 0.01%. 
   * The MOASS will happen over a few days and the chance you miss it out during a transfer is less than 0.01%. I've seen apes reporting the transfer finishes within a couple days. 
   * In summary, the chance of missing out MOASS is higher by staying in RH. 
 * Other brokers restricted trading during the short squeeze in January too, what gives? 
   * Well, so far, we've seen more shenanigans in RH than all other brokers. Brokers are most likely all evil. But you can choose to stand with the less evil ones. It's like president election, all candidates are bad and you have to pick one. Which one would you choose?

I will give 20k to any bag holding apes after the squeeze given they have proof they held through the entire thing and diamond handed so hard they couldn’t grab any tendies,1621416758.0,"Fellow apes let’s help the bag holders if there are any after the squeeze.


Edit: 
Damn this post really exploded. I’m over 100k invested in this stock and when it squeezes I will become a multimillionaire. I plan on giving millions back to the community anyway and am more than willing to give more than 20k to apes who diamond handed through it all to make it all possible (apes who somehow miss the squeeze and end up losing money). I love the ape community and the amazing things that we’ve done so far and I firmly believe in No Ape Left Behind.

Edit: A lot of apes are asking since when they’ve been holding. It really doesn’t matter because when this squeezes you all will make money. If for some reason you can’t sell or your PC and all other electronics explode and you end up missing the squeeze and LOSE money I along with the ape community would love to share our tendies. 

Also I and most likely the community would be very willing to help out in any situation you’re in. Maybe you can only afford X shares and it isn’t enough to pay off medical bills and debt, I’ll gladly spread some of my tendies. 

Also if any apes are starting companies and are open to investment, DM me after the squeeze (more than willing). I plan on starting my own companies and would love to start an ape Network where we can all help each other post squeeze.",2021-05-19 02:32:38

&#x200B;

I have yet to read any of the articles that I see going around about the Reddit Apes being racist and/or somehow keeping minorities ""out of the loop"" with our movement... I personally have experienced nothing but help and assistance when it comes learning about stocks and how they overall work, which is something I have never had the pleasure of being taught... It may be simple to some, but it is truly intimidating when a person does not know the information..

&#x200B;

I have never been asked about my ethnicity, and have always been helped with all my question(s) on my post and/or comments.. So I find it highly offensive when articles and HF put out false information about minorities being blocked out by apes, when in reality if those articles and HF truly cared about minorities, the would fund, promote and establish free programs in public schools and jr. colleges to teach us minorities of all ages, what exactly the stock market is and how to actually invest with knowledge and progress..

Take care my fellow apes and know I am a black man HODL with you and can't wait to see you all on the moon..

Trey's value isn't in just his DD ... his optimism and kindness are integral to our success.,1621576718.0,"The stock you invest in can have the best technical and the best DD, and the company can be super profitable. But if the HF decides to short the **** out of it, the stock will go down - no matter how smart you were. In other words, we can't do **** by ourselves. 

Trey brings a passion and kindness that have united this community - but it takes ALL apes to stay committed to succeed. He live-streams Q&A and texts with silverback. He doesn't have to - those are perks, not a right. Did ranting and whining at him about mixing up the dates change anything? Nope. All you did was breed ill-will. 

The strength of this AMC community (and our success in landing on the moon) lies in the ability for us to stay focused and united. In fact, the HF wants this community to self-explode - let's not play into their hand by tearing each other down. We need each other to hodl, and it is much easier to do this when we're also supportive of one another. 

Much love.

Apes, our saga is gettin' juicier than Minute Maid! Who's thirsty?

I hope that you enjoy my educational ""AMC Timeline."" My goal is to research, compile, maintain, and clearly explain the chronology of events in recent AMC stock history in order to:

1. provide a permanent point of historical reference for ""all things AMC stock"";
2. educate new and veteran apes alike on exactly how we got to this point;
3. paint a picture as to why/when/how shorts and hedge funds are getting increasingly desperate;
4. show that all happenings along the way thus far are squarely in apes' favor, slowly contributing to—and virtually guaranteeing—our moon landing;
5. give *existing* AMC apes the confidence that they need to buy and hodl more AMC bananas;
6. give *potential* AMC apes the confidence that they need to become first-time investors in glorious AMC shares . . . and hodl them sumbiches with kung-fu gorilla grip!

Learn, enjoy, and—most importantly—spread the word!

March 18, 2020:

Due to COVID-19, Adam Aron announces the closure of all AMC theaters nationwide. The resulting loss of income would be so extreme that the company was ""a couple of weeks away"" from bankruptcy multiple times before the squeeze on Jan. 27, 2021 (per Adam Aron in his April 14, 2021 interview with Trey's Trades). To this day, AMC has never received a penny in government assistance/bailouts (CARES Act, PPP loans, etc.). Despite that stark disadvantage, AMC has still managed to pay its employees and bills. Bravo!

January 27:

1- First AMC squeeze. The stock price jumped 310% overnight, from $4.96 at the close on January 26 to $20.34 at the open on January 27. (The price briefly reached almost $25 in pre-market on January 27.)

\-----

2. Robinhood screwed apes by restricting apes' ability to buy shares of AMC. Only selling was allowed, which directly benefitted hedge funds by tanking the share price. That is arguably the main reason why Vlad was dragged before the House to testify. Robinhood also implemented a 100% margin requirement for equity in AMC and GME.

February 26:

In a ridiculously intense, back-and-forth battle between apes and HF turds that literally wasn't decided until the finals seconds of trading, Apes emerged victorious by securing a closing price of $8.01 after rallying from $7.90 within only 4 minutes remaining. Finishing the day above $8.00 was very significant because it forced shorts and hedge fund pantywaists to have to purchase hundreds of thousands of shares via options contracts. The figure of ""$8.01"" has since become a rallying cry for the AMC ape movement.

&#x200B;

March 3:

1- Per AMC's proxy statement, "". . . 63,096,124 shares (including 3,732,625 treasury shares) of the total number of shares of Common Stock currently authorized remain available for issuance or may be reserved for issuance prior to any amendment to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock.""

(Ape Translation: Adam Aron clarified in his April 14, 2021 interview with Trey's Trades that 20 million of those 63 million shares are accounted for. Still, that leaves AMC with 43M already-approved shares available to introduce to the market WITHOUT apes' permission. So, if apes approve the 500M new shares, that will make Aron much more inclined to actually use those 43M already-approved shares that are CURRENTLY the only bullets in his holster. Just because he vowed to not use any of the 500M new shares in 2021 doesn't mean he won't use any of the 43M. In fact, getting the 500M new shares gives Aron much more freedom and ability to dilute with those 43M already-approved shares. That's why my vote is ""NO."" After we moon, Aron can dilute to his heart's content, and at a much higher price per share, too!)

5. Last day to submit your comments to the SEC in support of the approval of Rule NSCC-2021-801! Rule NSCC-2021-801 is the proverbial ""nail in the coffin"" that reeeeeeeeeeeally has the hedge funders shitting their fancy little britches. A decision will be imminent after April 8. The SEC is currently deliberating whether to approve this SUPER CRITICAL Rule SR-NSCC-2021-801, which would allow the NSCC to assess the risk of members (i.e., hedge funds) on a daily basis and also demand a higher Secondary Liquidity Deposit (SLD) on a daily basis if a member risks defaulting. If approved, this rule will force hedge funds and market makers to pay more if they are ""playing too risky."" It will also allow the DTCC to liquidate a member’s positions if those positions jeopardize the NSCC’s ability to complete that day’s trades. Furthermore, the arguably most important aspect of Rule NSCC-2021-801 is that hedge funds would no longer be able to take advantage of an inexplicable lack of scrutiny to hide naked shorting, FTD shares, dark pool trades, ladder attacks, trading amongst themselves to artificially lower the price per share, etc. They will no longer have 30 days to ""get their affairs in order,"" either. Transparency could be our newest and greatest weapon!

""Better Markets"" files an amicus brief (lawsuit) against Citadel to prevent Citadel from succeeding in stopping the SEC's plan to implement a new type of order (""Delimit Order"") developed by IEX. This new ""delimit order"" would essentially prevent Citadel and other hedge funds from engaging in high-frequency trading and stock price manipulation via the use of sophisticated equipment and non-public information that give them a huge, unfair advantage over retail investors in the marketplace.

April 14:

1- Gary Gensler, notorious supporter of ""the little guy,"" confirmed 53-45 by Senate to lead the SEC as Wall Street’s top regulator; plans to investigate SPACs and market manipulation by hedge funds (particularly in relation to Gamestop and AMC)

>""The GameStop saga has led congressional Democrats to ask the SEC to reexamine the practice of payment for order flow, whereby stock brokers are paid to direct customer orders to market makers, as well as features in trading apps that critics say exemplify the use of so-called gamification techniques to encourage harmful overuse of those apps by retail investors. . . . The blowup of Archegos, meanwhile, could encourage Gensler to propose new rules for institutional investors that require the disclosure of short positions in stocks as well as derivative positions that mimic stock ownership.""

2. Adam Aron interview with Trey's Trades!

Notable Adam Aron quotes from the interview, in sequential order:

* ""I am in this for the long haul \[as CEO\], 5-10 more years.""
* ""I am a fellow shareholder.""
* ""Long-term, I am a bull. I own over 3,000,000 shares of AMC stock.""
* ""I want to continue growing the company each year moving forward.""
* ""Our main goal is to increase shareholder value.""
* ""Our company is under attack by short sellers.""
* ""I haven't sold a single share in 5 years, and don't plan to. I am a believer in this company.""
* ""The last time we authorized 500,000,000 shares, we didn't use any shares \[32,000,000\] until 3.5 years later! We didn't use shares again \[300,000,000\] until 3.5 years after that! Each time, AMC's stock price rose 200%-300%.""
* ""Flooding the market with 500,000,000 shares woud be crazy and foolish.""
* ""If AMC shareholders authorize the 500,000,000 shares, we will pledge in writing that we will not issue a single share in calendar year 2021!""
* ""I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense.""
* ""We would only use shares to acquire other theater chains to instantly increase value for shareholders. Or to buy back debt at a significant discount to increase value. Or to entice landlords to accept stock NOW (at a discount) instead of waiting on cash over the course of 24-36 months.""
* ""If you don't vote at all, your vote will be counted as a ""No"" by default.
* ""You own AMC. This is YOUR company!""
* ""I will give you one prediction: 50 years from now, analysts will be claiming that XYZ is going to put AMC out of business. Why \[will AMC still be here\]? Because there is something magical about going to the movie theater! . . . Watching at home just doesn't have the same impact.""
* ""Going to the movie theater is a cheap date. The average movie ticket in the U.S. is about $10. Where else can you go to be entertained for 2-3 hours for only $10? You can't!""
* ""In 2019, the movie theater industry sold 7 times as many tickets as the NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, and MLS combined!""
* ""I think that AMC's best days are still to come.""
* ""I say to those people who are betting against us: I don't think it's a good idea to bet against movie theaters. It's certainly not a good idea to bet against AMC. And I'd like to think that it's not a good idea to bet against Adam Aron, either.""

April 17:

1- Gary Gensler sworn in as SEC Chairman, where he will serve as Joe Biden's enforcer, the ""top cop on Wall Street."" It’s very telling that he was quickly sworn in on a Saturday, which had not happened since 1973 (recession) and 2008 (recession) in order to address fraud. This is a clear indication that Biden and the SEC are preparing to take similar, emergency action against fraudulent actors and market manipulators.

2. Bitcoin dropped 15%, as institutions are likely selling Bitcoin to raise the massive collateral that they now require—starting on April 22—to fully insure their lenders, including apes. (See ""April 22"" below.)

3. Is somebody in a hurry? LMAO! Lights in Citadel's corporate building suggest that employees worked feverishly at all hours throughout the weekend, including Sunday. Hmmm . . . . Desperate much? The stock market was closed, but guess what was open for trading: Bitcoin. I suppose that it could be a total coincidence that Bitcoin dropped 15% on Saturday, but I doubt it. The more likely scenario is that Citadel and other hedge funds caused Bitcoin to plummet by selling Bitcoin to raise a small portion of the collateral that they will need to at least partially insure the lent/borrowed synthetic shares that they overleveraged, as required on or before April 22. (See ""April 22"" below.)

TDLR: ""This is it. If the brokers who lent retail investors' shares to the shorters ask for the shares back (because of this document and the April 22nd deadline), the shorters have to cover since they shorted the shares that were lent and now need to buy shares on the market because they don't have those lent shares anymore.

DTC-004 — Emergency plan for what to do if one of our members gets liquidated to shit fuck and puts us all at risk (submitted for immediate approval and accepted on 3/29)

DTC-005 - When a share is lent it gets marked as on loan and the person who borrowed it can’t lend it out again (submitted for approval on 4/1)

NSCC-003 — Same as DTC-002

NSCC-004 — Same as DTC-004

OCC-003 (also 801) — Everyone has to put more money into the “money we burn first if someone gets liquidated” pile (advance notice given on 2/10, submitted for approval 2/24, notice of pls give more time given on 4/6, notice of no objection (to the rule change not the time extension) by the sec filed 4/7)

Why I used to hate AMC Apes- An Explanation,1621113920.0,"I’m a GME XXXX holder since January and I come in peace. Just wanted to explain why I used to think AMC was a “distraction” from GME to help the newer apes understand the animosity from GME apes. 

I’m largely a lurker and from my poor memory- the GME play materialized in Wallstreetbets around early January (maybe in December). 

Someone realized that GME was shorted 140% and the idea was that WSB would buy up all the GME shares to own the float. We speculated that there was only 50M shares and it was possible. We’d hold our shares until the Melvin Capital felt the pain and had to cover. 

There were a couple of posts about AMC around this time but 95% of WSB posts were on GME. GME was the original, orchestrated play for WSB. 

I thought it was going to be a quick 2-3 week play- sell at $420.69 for the lulz. I don’t think anyone expected this to 1. drag out for months  2. become a global social justice movement or 3. expose the failings of the US stock market. 

It was simply a brilliant play based on the insane short interest on GME. 

As the days passed in January, this thing really started to gain momentum. WSBers started to buy up GME shares and then the DD posts landed on the front page. WSB grew exponentially. People who had never invested in stocks were opening Robinhood accounts to buy GME. I remember reading about a poor family in eastern Europe pooling their money together to buy GME. This thing was blowing up.

The price of GME boomed. But a curious thing was happening. A few other stocks jumped as well- BB, NOK, KOSS, NAKD, TR,....AMC. 

WSB became flooded with posts about these other “meme stocks”. Someone was spamming about SLV. 

WSB needed solidarity to make this thing work. Posts implored the degenerates to “Focus on GME. GME is the play! Everything other than GME is a distraction!” (sound familiar?)

For months I continued to see AMC as a distraction. Money from WSBers that went into BB, NOK, KOSS,...AMC was not helping us. If you weren’t buying GME- you were against us. 

Very few people are talking about BB and NOK these days but the AMC apes have endured. 

When I heard the AMC CEO took a huge bonus- I didn’t believe Adam Aron had the apes’ best interest. It got iffy when the 500M shares vote was on the table and the apes were divided.


Now that I see Aron calling Trey Trades on the phone during a livestream-I see better. AMC is a play on its own and Aron has your back. 

AMC and GME apes fight the same fight. Apes Strong Together. See you on the moon 🚀

Edit 1: Thanks for the love! - I know some apes don’t like my use of the word “orchestrated” but I stand by it. What WSB did and what apes are doing now is not market manipulation and is legal.

Edit 2: I understand some apes say they want to buy GME with their squeeze profits- but don’t you think they’ll squeeze together? And this means you’d be selling which would hurt AMC’s squeeze... Am I missing something?",2021-05-15 14:25:20

CEO confirms what we have been thinking this whole time!!,1620205824.0,"Edit: changed numbers to deduct institutional investors.

Edit 2:  holy moly!! AA just tweeted that AMC has over 3 million individual shareholders!!!! 😳 

https://twitter.com/ceoadam/status/1389943594048532484?s=21

That would mean, with the same math as below, that the float would be 3 billion shares!! Insane!!! 
Decide that by the available float, and that means there could be 8.21 times the numbers of shares out there!!! 

————

Now, I want to start off by saying that I am a dumb ape, so if anything I said is wrong, please let me know. This is not financial advice. 

————


So the CEO said he is postponing the vote until July 29th in order to allow the MILLIONS of shareholders time to vote. He said millions with an S!! That means there could be more than 2 million shareholders. 

I’ve been doing a bit of math and this is crazy news! He basically just confirmed what we have been saying from the start! 

The free float is 417,710,000 shares (according to Webull). But it’s 365,014,418 once the institutional investors (52,695,582 according to fintel) are deducted. If there are 2 million shareholders, that means each shareholder would hold on average 182 shares (365,014.418 divided by 2 million = 182 shares). 
182 shares is NOTHING compared to how many most shareholders have. 
This is crazy! It basically confirms there are more shares than legally allowed! 

Now, I tried calculating how many shares are out there if I choose a more reasonable share average per person. Lets say 1000 (considering there are some with xx shares, and some with xx,xxx). 

If there is 2,000,000 shareholders holding 1,000 shares, that would bring the float to 2,000,000,000 😳 let that sink in for a second!!! Now, divide that by the actual float of 365,014,418 and that means there could be 5.47 times the float circulating out there!!! 

What in the actual f*ck!!! This is insane!!! The moon is near!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🦍",2021-05-05 02:10:24

Found This On The Yahoo Finance AMC Forum - Happy Reading,1616287709.0," Events of March 19 (IMO)  
I am close to 60 years of age, hold degrees in economics, finance and accounting, so numbers are what they are to me. I have been trading and investing over 20 years on a daily basis and have a pretty solid bank of experience with regard to the stock market, So what happened on Friday March 19?  


A couple of obvious points, early on there was a coordinate effort to drop the stock price toward $13 a share. That failed because of the amount of buying pressure that was put on the dive down in price. By 10 am it was apparent that the stock was not dropping below $13.50 a share and the line was drawn at $14.00 by what appears to have been a massive coordinated effort by several investment firms. As an avid watcher of levels 2 and 3 with regard to the stocks I have an interest in, this is the first and only time I can recall seeing 8-10 market makers all in unison controlling the ask price of a ticker. Like a professional dance company all of them moved in unison on the ask. Up a penny, down a half penny, etc etc and all within milliseconds of each other. This dance continued for hours on end, never allowing the price to run up.  
At close, these market makers all hit the bid with over 40 million shares. My question, where did all those shares come from and where did they go on the bid.  


We will never be able to prove any illegal activity regardless of what happened at the end of the day yesterday. The SEC sure as hell isn't going to look into anything. Remember, it is the hedge funds that are accusing us of manipulating the stock price, which is not true at all because we all love the stock, and I love the company. Been going to the theaters since they used 16mm reels and Dolby systems did not exist.  


OK. So what is the read into everything Well. first and foremost, it was an act of desperation by the hedge funds. They pretty much announced to the world that they know they are screwed on this one and no longer care what tactics they use in their efforts to minimize their upcoming losses. Second, as all of those shares were being sold between 13.90 and 14.02 how many are now in the hands of apes? Of those how many are real shares and how many naked shares will they need to add to the piles of failure to deliver shares, naked shares and the over 187000 call options that expired ITM yesterday? In a nut shell, I think they dug a deeper hole than even they can climb out of.  


Now more than ever here I am determined to keep buying and will not sell 1 share until these hedge funds start to cover all of their misdeeds. It's coming, they are going to delay it as long as possible trying to spread fear of a massive drop in price, trying to get current investors to become impatient and sell. Trying to divide the shareholders into groupings that they will intend to attack separately. They will attack the first group, those who think they will sell at $30 a share, then they will go after the next group of those who think $50 a share is enough and so on. Remember its easier for them to attack smaller groups than the entire group of apes. IT IS KEY THAT WE STICK TOGETHER.  


The price of our stock is up again this week and although we did not end above $14 a share the week was a win for us again. For the past month we have been winning the battles and eventually we will win the war and the price of this stock will soar.  


Patience is needed now more than ever. This will not be the last effort of our common enemy. They will continue to pull every stunt they think they can, and we simply need to not sell any of our shares. For us the battle is getting easier. for them it gets more complex with every stunt they pull and fail at. Make no mistake in reading into this past weeks action, WE WON, THEY LOST. There are hundreds of millions of shares that will need to be purchased to cover short positions which are not just under $14. They still have FTD contracts that go back to when this was under $8. In other words they are still way behind on their obligations. We aren't.  


Going to be another good week ahead if we all hold these shares and those who can, me included, continue to buy and hold more shares. Be smart with what you spend here. But be assured that this company is not a $14 a share company even without the squeeze. With operations back at AMC as a minimum this ticker will trade in the $20 range so the future still shows upward movement even without what we all know is coming in the near future.  


Sorry about being long winded, I just thought it needed to be out that we are still winning this war and we will resume the fight on Monday the 22nd.  


Have a great weekend.",2021-03-20 17:48:29

DONT BUY HEDGEFUND MANIPULATION! WHAT WE SAW TODAY WAS THEIR PLAN!,1617068055.0,"I am not financial advisor, you should not base any investing decisions on this post (not financial advice). Make you own decision if you LOVE AMC AS MUCH AS I DO! T

&#x200B;

WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IS **MENTAL WARFARE**. DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE HEDGIES!

Today we saw great news when some of our hedge fund friends informed: ""we might be screwed"". Immediately we started our celebration of victory, saw huge squueze coming in our eyes. Oh those Ferrari's and Lambos that I can buy soon...

HOLD YOUR HORSES. DONT BE NAIVE! WHY WOULD THEY GIVE US THIS INFORMATION RIGHT NOW? AFTER THEY HAVE DONE ALL THIS ILLEGAL MANIPULATION? **BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THEIR PLAN! THIS IS THE WAY THEY THINK WE LET THEM BALE OUT CHEAP!**

Today Credit Suisse and some other parties gave us information that some hedge funds might be facing serious losses soon. They even gave estimate about losses with current market price. Well we all know what that means! Celebrate, they surrendered, they finally told us they are giving up, squueze is coming! This is what they expected and wanted to get from us!  **This was their first move.**

**Their second move will be** letting price go up to around $20-$30 and get us thinking: it is happening, lets follow where our profit targets should be. After they have managed to drive price down little bit, they will make **their third move** and release new (false)information: ""Credit Suisse confirms: danger over, we are saved, we managed to get out. Citadel will tell how they were able to cover all of their short positions. (Hey this sounds familiar, they did say that with GME already). **Fourth move will be actually delivered by us** if this goes how they plan it to go: news like this will scare away those people that jumped in because of hype posts we have seen today, maybe even some diamond hands who think $25 is enough and squueze already happened. This will lead to selling pressure and drive price down. Maybe this is enough and they can get price down, if not they can go back to old ways and manipulate price down even more. Imagine price going up to $30/ share and coming back to $10/ share. That would make us feel uncomfortable right? And that was their fifth move.

THEY ARE FIGHTING US WITH PSYCHOLOGY! THEY HAVE PROBAPLY HIRED EXPERTS THAT HAVE CREATED THEM LONG TERM PLAN TO GET PEOPLE BELIEVING THEIR AGENDA.

I know todays news sounded nice. I was smiling when I was reading those posts, I'm still smiling, but not because I know they will give up soon. I smile because why ever they wrote those releases tells us we are going to see price going up! Like I said earlier DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE HEDGIES! DO NOT SHARE OVER OPTIMISTIC INFORMATION. DO NOT FOLLOW THEIR RULES, FOLLOW OUR RULES! WE WILL TELL THEM OUR RULES, NOT OTHER WAY AROUND! 

&#x200B;

*I want to add in the end, that I might be wrong or right, but I seriously doubt about hedgies giving us this clear evidence about their coming death. Why would they give up right now? Why would they inform us in advance, and give us more time to buy cheap shares before they die? Why it doesn't happen right away if they have already accepted their destiny.*

*What would you do in their shoes?* ***What I wrote above is what I would have done, and I think they are not stupid. They have shown us they are ready to do what ever it takes to get us selling. Now they try to use our hype against us.***",2021-03-29 18:34:15

Warning for Friday 3/26,1616799702.0,"Look, I'll be straight up with you guys, I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about and I am not a financial advisor.

However, I do pride myself on ancient military strategy and battlefield tactics. And last week's bullshit really, really fucking sent my spidey-sense tingling off the fuckin radar. Here is why:

\*\*\*When you are fighting asymmetrical warfare (think against unorganized, guerilla fighters), one of the best strategies that you can employ is to embolden your enemy to partially organize and attempt symmetrical warfare with you at a time and place of your choosing.\*\*\*

***This is what occurred on the date of March 19, 2021.*** Suddenly, this super important date called the Quiddtich Harry Potter Hogwarts day started popping up everywhere, and idiots peddled that organizational nonsense until we all got brainwashed into believing we could actually stand up and fight together. ***WRONG.*** The movement was baited and this caused a great many people to spend all their chips and become ***OVEREXTENDED.***

A classic rope-a-dope style maneuver occurred, which exhausted the liquidity of the movement as a whole and caused an uncontested rout between Monday and Wednesday of this week. Until, ding ding, people started getting their paychecks in and liquidity returned to the battlefield.

***DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN. LEARN FROM IT. KEEP AWAY FROM HARD DATES AND TIMES.***

Secondly, there are a great many people spouting off (***YoU hAvE tO bUy At MaRkEt PrIcE iF yOu WaNt To SeE a SqUeEzE!!!)***

You don't have to do any fucking such thing. The entire genius around this movement is the Ape, a new species has entered the market. Listen to me. BULLS run up the score. BEARS chase it back down. APES fill this new niche in the market where bears can no longer pass and on which bulls can rely on a support. By using the shorts against themselves, Apes create their own Bull runs and turn bears against themselves. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PERFORM THE FUNCTION OF A BULL!

***APES BUY THE DIPS AND HOLD THE CHIPS. THIS IS THE FOUNDATIONAL TENET ON WHICH THIS WHOLE THING RIDES.***

Apes do not have to organize on a field of battle. Apes do not have to risk their money buying at high prices. Apes buy low and hold forever if that's what it takes. Apes remove shares from the market and restrict the supply. This can be done at anytime anywhere and strike like lightning in the fucking dark.

So expect the scalp today and remember, they are baiting you. Don't overextend yourselves. Save some chips to put the fight in when the dips get low.

***Because that's what real Apes do.***

THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE OPTIONS VOLUME FOR ANYTHING TO HAPPEN WITH AMC.. PEROID.,1615071727.0,"I keep saying this and luckily there are a few other people along with myself that are trying to get people to hear this but for some reason no one is listening.

It’s just getting overshadowed by people who have no clue what’s going on or why we are even here. Which I'm not shaming anyone for, I just want to get the right info out there so people are not mislead. People just screaming buy and hold not knowing that we need more than that. It’s like someone is trying to distract us from potentially Gamma Squeezing AMC.

The reason AMC even became a thing a couple weeks ago was because someone noticed the potential for a gamma squeeze. That’s why there is all this hype around AMC. The potential for a Gamma Squeeze. So if we aren’t going to take advantage of this opportunity to GAMMA SQUEEZE AMC then we are wasting our time. Any experienced trader will tell you this. A GAMMA SQUEEZE requires a high volume of options investors and a high volume of options expiring in the money.

Everyone keeps screaming THIS IS NOT A DEAD CAT. Although they are right they arent being completely honest about the entire scenario.  AMC is primed for a gamma squeeze with failure to delivers, high utilization, increasing borrow interest etc. But those things don't do anything on their own, but they do set up a gamma squeeze if we get consistent high volume in call options & ITM call option expirations. IF we start buying a lot of call options then it can moon. If that doesn't happen its a wasted opportunity.

Before you ask any questions please read this post from the link below that goes into great detail and explains how a gamma squeeze works and its relation to AMC. You guys want to really learn? Better understand what’s going on? Please take the time to read it. I know it’s long but I promise once you’re done reading you would have learned a lot.

UPDATE: I’d watch this I agree with everything Trey Trades says here. I’m also really calling for those who know how to trade options to do that instead of buying shares and invite their friends who trade option to buy option because of this opportunity to gamma squeeze them. If you’ve never traded options, buying shares and holding helps and you are playing your part. You are contributing by buying shares and holding we just need options traders to show up like you diamond handed fucks have 💎🙌 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LZA-YRX2Uo

With that said if you are reading this and you’re an experienced options trader. This is a play you want to get in on. Look into and you’ll see this is a good tip for a great play. There is huge potiential for a gamma squeeze. If you are indeed an experienced options trader then you know your stuff and I’ll just say that if you do your DD you’ll see the play there. Key dates to look at are are Feb 26 and March 19. As you’re doing your DD and want some more leads just DM me and I’ll send you DD leads.",2021-03-06 16:02:07

We CAN hit over $100k a share. WE ALL HAVE TO AGREE TO HOLD.,1620612699.0,"(I am not your financial advisor and this is not financial advice. You do whatever you want with your money.)

I have done so much research on this stock and I gotta say that I am VERY bullish. It’s at the point where it’s not about IF it’s about WHEN.

We are at the point where we all need to stick together and HOLD. We CAN do this. I have so much faith in this community and I know that we can reach $100k.

Remember, the squeeze is gonna last a couple days. We’ll have all that time to hold. There WILL be some fuckery on the way up, but I’d be DAMNED if I sold under $100k.

We fucking got this, after all... we’re fucking APES. WE WANT OUR 🍌🍌🍌

To sum up, 100k is realistically the floor. We just gotta hold.

Diamond hands forever🤲🏻💎🦍🚀

Edit 1: I just wanted to clarify something. I am not guaranteeing we will hit $100k. I unfortunately lost my crystal ball a while back so I don't know. HOWEVER, I am saying that we can realistically hit $100k if we **ALL** HOLD. We own the majority of outstanding shares, it is possible. Obviously, it is a team effort and that's why we need to communicate effectively when the squeeze is happening. We just have to be patient and see what happens. I LOVE YOU ALL!

Edit 2: I am not telling anyone to sell at $100k. Sell at whatever price you feel comfortable with, it's your position after all. With that being said, AMC will never reach $100k if we don't hold which is the entire point of this post. As for me, I'm gonna keep holding cause I like the stock!",2021-05-09 19:11:39

I've created a list of great reads to get you started. The links are below. Some are a mixture of AMC and GME. That doesn't matter because the enemy is the same. Superstonk is super lucky to have super amazing smart people who do godlike research. Their community is what makes them so strong and how GME has gotten so far.

We do not talk against GME. This reddit is for all of us. I don't want to hear negative talk about them. If you want segregation, go to superstonk and don't bring your AMC talk or they'll downvote you. I understand they don't like AMC because they think it's a distraction.. Read these and become more knowledgeable. Make the decision yourself but Ape no fight Ape.


We do not collude here to buy any stocks. We all just happen to like it and come together to research and discuss it. Under no circumstances do we come together to agree to buy at a certain time of day or in mass quantities.


Stay positive. I guarantee people read this. We already have the news trying to make reddit the villain. We cannot give them ammo to prove their point.



Taking a rule from superstonk.. Remember, don't reach out to political figures through this sub or about this sub. Many of us are not from America and thus any discussions with them can be seen as being persuaded by foreign influence. Whatever you do, do it on your own time. Education is key.


Please read dd and interact in this sub. Better yourself.

💎Reporting in from South Korea: Please acknowledge how strong we are TOGETHER🚀,1621962958.0,"A quick introduction of myself, I was born in the States and was gifted with dual citizenship as my parents were Koreans. Though I was raised in the States, my parents were brilliant enough to constantly educated me to understand the culture, lifestyle, and ideologies of Koreans which helped me to gain easier access to get along as I am now working in Korea.

&#x200B;

As I am in Korea now, I was first able to find this meme, Reddit, stocks after the GME incident which was also all over the news and media in Korea last year. I am not here to generalize all of the Koreans, but the tendencies of culture movement and the fast-pacing lifestyle that the Koreans have are quite typical to be observed in everyday lives and these characteristics play a very important role when it comes to investments.

&#x200B;

The Korean stock market is also highly corrupted as the shorts from overseas including the same companies that are shorting on AMC are doing the equivalent actions to the major stocks in Korea and that the Korean Apes, so-called Ants, have endured for a VERY long time.

&#x200B;

Main Point:

&#x200B;

I want everyone to take a look at how many Koreans, only the COUNTABLE and VISIBLE ones, there are that are taking part in this revolutionary movement. What Adam mentioned about 3.2M retail investors are only referred to the US and Canadian investors and after you take a look at what I present to you below, it will mind-blow you for sure.

&#x200B;

Most Koreans use this Message App called Kakaotalk which is just like Whatsapp in the States. Within that App, it has open group chat rooms that you can easily search and find and I think this is a simple chat version of discord where ppl exchanges their thoughts and messages. I am currently in one group chat room that consists of 56 people as in the image below

&#x200B;

[ Private Disccusion Chatroom](https://preview.redd.it/cszpt6c6h8171.jpg?width=648&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f9cdf39380b2d32d036dda40ecc9a436f1e26a6)

&#x200B;

What brought our attention was to see how many stocks we have in our group chat room alone. The last highlighted box in the below image represents the total number of shares and the one above is the average stocks that our single room is holding. As we could not force everyone to expose their share amounts, we were only able to gather up to 45 out of 56 people. As you can see our single group chat room is holding a total of 163,482 shares with an average of 3,633 shares.

&#x200B;

[ List of share count](https://preview.redd.it/nh6nu88mj8171.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0211200012d8b7fbc29c0d7ff8d1ca8d6e52f0c)

&#x200B;

Then I looked and searched at the available open chat rooms by searching the word “AMC” and there are about 45 chat rooms that are about a total of 1900 people. This is ONLY a very small and limited way that I tried to find how many AMC investors there are that are ONLY COUNTABLE.

&#x200B;

[ When searched the word \\""AMC\\"" in Openchat room](https://preview.redd.it/ln0ztmefh8171.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdf6ba8924d6c0bd98ccb7fe8fc64e8c984724ce)

&#x200B;

A very conservative calculation I did is if there are 1900 COUNTABLE and VISIBLE people holding an average of 3700 shares, then it adds up to about 7M shares. I also asked the people in my chat room how conservative my calculation was and most of them said the minimum can be at least a double which is 14M shares that are being held by the Koreans at the moment. Though the statistics can be relatively off because of the limited information provided, what I know for sure is that the current retail investors outside of the US and Canada are only the surface of an iceberg.

&#x200B;

Please acknowledge the support, devotion, and strength that APES and Ants are fighting and putting together as a GLOBAL MATTER to correct what was supposed to be done a long time ago, destroying hedgies.

Apes, our saga is gettin' juicier than Minute Maid!  Who's thirsty?

I hope that you enjoy my educational ""AMC Timeline.""  My goal was to compile and clearly explain the chronology of events in recent AMC stock history in order to:

1. provide a permanent point of historical reference for ""all things AMC stock"";
2. educate new and veteran apes alike on exactly how we got to this point;
3. paint a picture as to why/when/how shorts and hedge funds are getting increasingly desperate;
4. show that all happenings along the way thus far are squarely in apes' favor, slowly contributing to—and virtually guaranteeing—our moon landing;
5. give *existing* AMC apes the confidence that they need to buy and hodl more AMC bananas;
6. give *potential* AMC apes the confidence that they need to become first-time investors in glorious AMC shares . . . and hodl them sumbiches with kung-fu gorilla grip!

Learn, enjoy, and spread the word!

&#x200B;

NOTE:  If you think that something is missing from the timeline, please send me a message.  I'll gladly add it!

March 18, 2020:

Due to COVID-19, AMC CEO Adam Aron officially announces the temporary (but, ultimately, much-longer-than-expected) closure of all AMC theaters nationwide.  The resulting loss of income was so extreme that the company was ""a couple of weeks away"" from bankruptcy multiple times before the squeeze on January 27, 2021 (per AMC CEO, Adam Aron in his April 14, 2021 interview with Trey's Trades).

[https://www.amctheatres.com/covid-19-update](https://www.amctheatres.com/covid-19-update)

&#x200B;

December 17, 2020:

SEC states that Robinhood misled its customers about how it was paid by Wall Street firms to pass along customers' trading data and that the start-up had made money at the expense of its customers.  Robinhood agrees to pay a $65 million fine to settle the charges, without admitting or denying guilt.

[https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)

&#x200B;

January 26:

AMC secures $917M in new capital to avoid bankruptcy through at least the end of 2021, the breaking news of which was the catalyst for the squeeze the following day

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-secures-%24917m-lifeline-to-avert-bankruptcy-shares-pop-26-2021-01-26](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-secures-%24917m-lifeline-to-avert-bankruptcy-shares-pop-26-2021-01-26)

&#x200B;

January 27:

1-  The first AMC squeeze took place.  The stock price jumped 310% overnight, from $4.96 at the close on January 26 to $20.34 at the open on January 27.  (The price briefly reached almost $25 in pre-market on January 27.)

\-----

2.  Robinhood screwed apes by restricting apes' ability to buy shares of AMC.  Only selling was allowed, which directly benefitted hedge funds by tanking the share price.  That is arguably the main reason why Vlad was dragged before the House to testify.  Robinhood also implemented a 100% margin requirement for equity in AMC and GME.

[https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-news-012721/h\_f037344e14a037160cc724607ff72da0](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-news-012721/h_f037344e14a037160cc724607ff72da0)

&#x200B;

January 28:

1-  Robinhood blocks apes from buying shares of AMC, GME, and other stocks

&#x200B;

February 26:

In a ridiculously intense, back-and-forth battle between apes and HF turds that literally wasn't decided until the finals seconds of trading, Apes emerged victorious by securing a closing price of $8.01 after rallying from $7.90 within only 4 minutes remaining.  Finishing the day above $8.00 was very significant because it forced shorts and hedge fund pantywaists to have to purchase hundreds of thousands of shares via options contracts.  The figure of ""$8.01"" has since become a rallying cry for the AMC ape movement.

&#x200B;

March 3:

Per AMC's proxy statement, "". . . 63,096,124 shares (including 3,732,625 treasury shares) of the total number of shares of Common Stock currently authorized remain available for issuance or may be reserved for issuance prior to any amendment to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock.""

(Ape Translation:  Adam Aron clarified in his April 14, 2021 interview with Trey's Trades that 20 million of those 63 million shares are accounted for.  Still, that leaves AMC with 43M already-approved shares available to introduce to the market WITHOUT apes' permission.  So, if apes approve the 500M new shares, that will make Aron much more inclined to actually use those 43M already-approved shares that are CURRENTLY the only bullets in his holster.  Just because he vowed to not use any of the 500M new shares in 2021 doesn't mean he won't use any of the 43M.  In fact, getting the 500M new shares gives Aron much more freedom and ability to dilute with those 43M already-approved shares.  That's why my vote is ""NO.""  After we moon, Aron can dilute to his heart's content, and at a much higher price per share, too!)

5.  Last day to submit your comments to the SEC in support of the approval of Rule NSCC-2021-801!  Rule NSCC-2021-801 is the proverbial ""nail in the coffin"" that reeeeeeeeeeeally has the hedge funders shitting their fancy little britches.  A decision will be imminent after April 8.  The SEC is currently deliberating whether to approve this SUPER CRITICAL Rule SR-NSCC-2021-801, which would allow the NSCC to assess the risk of members (i.e., hedge funds) on a daily basis and also demand a higher Secondary Liquidity Deposit (SLD) on a daily basis if a member risks defaulting.  If approved, this rule will force hedge funds and market makers to pay more if they are ""playing too risky.""  It will also allow the DTCC to liquidate a member’s positions if those positions jeopardize the NSCC’s ability to complete that day’s trades.  Furthermore, the arguably most important aspect of Rule NSCC-2021-801 is that hedge funds would no longer be able to take advantage of an inexplicable lack of scrutiny to hide naked shorting, FTD shares, dark pool trades, ladder attacks, trading amongst themselves to artificially lower the price per share, etc.  They will no longer have 30 days to ""get their affairs in order,"" either.  Transparency could be our newest and greatest weapon!

""The GameStop saga has led congressional Democrats to ask the SEC to reexamine the practice of payment for order flow, whereby stock brokers are paid to direct customer orders to market makers, as well as features in trading apps that critics say exemplify the use of so-called gamification techniques to encourage harmful overuse of those apps by retail investors. . . .  The blowup of Archegos, meanwhile, could encourage Gensler to propose new rules for institutional investors that require the disclosure of short positions in stocks as well as derivative positions that mimic stock ownership.""

* ""I want to continue growing the company each year moving forward.""
* ""Our main goal is to increase shareholder value.""
* ""Our company is under attack by short sellers.""

April 17:

1-  Gary Gensler sworn in as SEC Chairman, where he will serve as Joe Biden's enforcer, the ""top cop on Wall Street.""  It’s very telling that he was quickly sworn in on a Saturday, which had not happened since 1973 (recession) and 2008 (recession) in order to address fraud.  This is a clear indication that Biden and the SEC are preparing to take similar, emergency action against fraudulent actors and market manipulators.

2.  Bitcoin dropped 15%, as institutions are likely selling Bitcoin to raise the massive collateral that they now require—starting on April 22—to fully insure their lenders, including apes.  (See ""April 22"" below.)

\-----

3.  Is somebody in a hurry?  LMAO!  Lights in Citadel's corporate building suggest that employees worked feverishly at all hours throughout the weekend, including Sunday.  Hmmm . . . .  Desperate much?  The stock market was closed, but guess what was open for trading:  Bitcoin.  I suppose that it could be a total coincidence that Bitcoin dropped 15% on Saturday, but I doubt it.  The more likely scenario is that Citadel and other hedge funds caused Bitcoin to plummet by selling Bitcoin to raise a small portion of the collateral that they will need to at least partially insure the lent/borrowed synthetic shares that they overleveraged, as required on or before April 22.  (See ""April 22"" below.)

April 20:

1-  Date by which the share count—which will expose the number of synthetic shares—must be completed, which is 14 days before the shareholder meeting on May 4.

(HUGE NEWS:  After the audit finished on Tuesday, April 20, there were suddenly zero (0) shares available to short the entire rest of the week, Wed-Fri!  Did the count uncover an insane number of synthetic shares?  Seems likely.  That would obviously disallow additional share lending, which is what we saw.)

(Apish: ""You overleveraged bastards must now have the cash or collateral ON-HAND to fully cover every share that you borrow/lend, including unrealized losses!  And, if you fuckers need to borrow more each day, you must also sufficiently increase your cash-on-hand and collateral to be able to FULLY COVER each day.

Unfortunately, I have some bad news, but with a silver lining. 

On the next day of trading, Tuesday June 1st (no trading on Monday because it’s a holiday) you will see your account take a beating like no other!

DON’T!!!

Your fellow ape brothers and sister are right beside you, holding on to their share with the shinyist of diamond hands! The silver lining is the stock is on discount, so you can average down and load up on more!! 

They are doing this on June 1st because on June 3rd, AMC is releasing the official share count. This will show the true number of shares. It will weed out all of those pesky synthetic ones.

Watch your screen near market close. No matter what we’ll know their move. They have to deliver today or have a failure to deliver and begin paying interest. 

I can’t stress this enough. You know they manipulate the price so stop getting scared. Stop staring at your screen all day. They are trying to get you to panic sell, and honestly at this point if you fall for it it’ll be your loss not ours.

UPDATE: 

So the latter has happened. They failed to deliver which we knew might happen. They will begin paying interest for failure to deliver.

As myself and another Redditor agreed on,  they probably would rather pay interest than have the possibility of us reaching  $12 by Friday because that would mean a significant amount of calls that would be expiring in the money. Adding to their tab.

AMC Entertainment (AMC) Stock Highlights Corruption On Wall Street

May 3, 2021 by Joshua Rodriguez

I’ve been covering AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) stock, as I often do with stocks that the “experts” say are going to tank, with a contrarian opinion. I’ve received tons of emails. However, things have been very different this time around.

Usually, when I cover a stock that “the masses” believe will fall, and say something like, “it’s a great time to buy,” the emails I receive can be tough to read. I’m told how horrible I am to get people excited about the stock, my intelligence is questioned, and the insults, and often threats pile up.

However, AMC has been very different.

Over the past few weeks, I’ve received hundreds, if not thousands of… thank you emails!!!

What, why, how?

How is it that when I say AMC, a stock that’s been battered by hedge funds and touted as the worst investment on Wall Street, is going to head up, I get thank you emails? Well, you might be surprised to find out.

Ultimately, AMC stock sets the stage for an understanding of just what’s wrong with the stock market today.

Corruption Among Big Money Players Has No Bounds

You may not want to hear this, but it’s not hard to turn the “experts” into parrots. All it takes is money, and many of these highly regarded Wall Street experts will say whatever you want them to. It’s why there’s six figure pump and dump campaigns that lead to losses for the masses all the time.

And I believe that the vast majority of experts have become paid parrots when it comes to AMC, repeating what their masters tell them they need to say.

So, who are those masters?

&#x200B;

Hedge funds.

The fact of the matter is that while we generally see the stock market as a fair and equitable place, it is one of the most corrupt places on earth, with hedge funds often leading in that corruption. These funds have massive amounts of money, and throw that money around to generate even more money, often at the cost of extreme losses to the retail community.

Take a look at the message below from a moderator of the Wall Street Bets Reddit that has led to short squeezes in GameStop, AMC, and several other stocks:

As you can see, Isaias is sharing a message from what is perceived to be a hedge fund, asking to pay a specific dollar amount per subscriber on his platform to become the fund’s mouthpiece to his following.

&#x200B;

But there are a few very interesting things to consider here:

Bitcoin As Payment? The hedge funds are clearly being very sneaky here. In the message, Isaias is offered Bitcoin as payment. This is an interesting play since Bitcoin can’t be tracked like a wire transfer or other traditional forms of payment. This shows that whatever hedge fund contacted him is taking extraordinary steps to make sure that whoever they’re paying doesn’t share the fact that they’ve been paid. This may surprise you to find out, but that’s totally illegal! If you get paid to write about a stock, you have to disclose that payment to readers, well, if you’re a normal person. If you’re working for a hedge fund with a Bitcoin wallet, the rules seem to be bending.

How Many People Accepted the Offer. Interestingly, even experts that appeared to be bullish on AMC last year have made a complete 180 degree turn, now spreading bearish opinions. One has to wonder how many of these are paid for opinions, paid for with Bitcoin in an effort to hide the fact that these are paid opinions and make investors believe that the expert writing the content is sharing his own, true opinion. It’s getting a bit shady out there!

Several Offers. Reading the message in the screenshot above clearly shows that this isn’t the first message, or offer, Isaias has received from this sender. He’s pretty much beating a dead horse, begging to take control over the moderator’s opinion to sway the very retail investors these hedge funds have led to detrimental losses for.

How Hedge Funds Manipulate The Stock Market

Hedge funds have been manipulating the market for years, and for the most part, it has been a completely legal process. That is, until they started trying to hide the fact that they’re hiring experts, using Bitcoin as an anonymous payment to sway the masses.

&#x200B;

But how have they done it?

It’s important to keep in mind that news doesn’t move the market, nor does the validity of an investment, the experts touting how strong or weak that investment may be, or even the management team behind the company.

Prices move in the market as a result of supply and demand balancing itself out.

As investors buy a stock, supplies shrink and demand climbs, sending the price upward. On the other hand, when market participants sell a stock, a flood of supply hits the market in times when demand is low, leading to declines in the price of the stock.

Hedge funds take advantage of this system by taking out massive short positions on stocks like AMC, GameStop, and countless others. When taking those short positions, these funds are essentially borrowing shares from investors that are long the stock, and immediately selling them into the open market.

These sales of massive blocks of shares tip the scales of supply and demand, often leading the price of the stock downward. As that downward activity takes place, fearful retail investors begin selling their positions, often at a loss, to avoid further bleeding. Once the hedge fund believes the stock has fallen as low as it can, they repurchase the shares they sold to start the whole thing, returning them to their rightful owners and making boatloads of cash in the process.

This is an activity that has been going on for years, leading to the loss of countless amounts of money for countless small, retail investors, that became the unknowing victims of big money players on Wall Street.

Again, I want to be very clear about one thing here. This isn’t illegal, and unless hedge funds are sneakily paying for expert opinions without disclosures, they’ve done nothing wrong, unless you look at things from a moral perspective.

&#x200B;

Back To AMC

As the title of this article suggests, there’s no better place to see the corruption in the stock market at the moment than AMC, a movie theater chain that dealt with significant pain throughout the pandemic.

Recently, there has been a significant increase in the short interest seen on AMC stock. At the same time, there’s been a significant change to how experts see the stock. All over the internet, you’ll find bears pleading with retail investors to get away from the stock, sell it immediately, and never look back.

They say that over the next two years, the company will lose somewhere between $1.8 billion and $2.4 billion, forcing it into a financial restructuring via bankruptcy. They say consumers don’t like going to movie theaters anymore, and that AMC has absolutely no chance of recovery.

One has to wonder how much Bitcoin they received to say these things, but that’s what’s being said nonetheless.

There’s no question that AMC has struggled. What else would you expect from a company that had to shut its doors for months as the result of a pandemic? Would you expect their profits to rise? Would you expect gains? Of course not.

But the naysayers say the company has no real path to recovery, and that’s a bunch of bull\*&\^%, fill in the blanks there my friends.

The fact of the matter is that the movie exhibition chain has reopened the vast majority of its theaters, is going through a debt restructuring to cure its financial blues, and with blockbuster movies like Godzilla vs. Kong hitting the screens, with many other big hits expected to come out this year and next, the idea that a recovery simply can’t happen is an unfounded one.

You’ve been cooped up in your house for a while. Have you thought about a night out for dinner and a movie? I know I have, and with AMC being the largest chain in the United States, when you go for that dinner and a movie, you’re likely to walk through the doors of one of their theaters.

&#x200B;

The Bottom Line

The bottom line here is simple. What we’re seeing with AMC and what we have seen since the beginning of the year outlines what’s wrong with the stock market as it stands today. Investors feel comfortable investing as FINRA and the SEC are charged with creating a fair and equitable environment for all. However, money rules the world, and these regulatory agencies don’t seem to be doing anything to stop the corruption of big money hedge funds.

The good news is that where regulatory agencies seem to falter, retail investors are picking up the slack. If these agencies aren’t going to fine or imprison fund managers that make their livings by taking money out of the pockets of small retail investors, retail investors are going to fight back by banding together, knowing that the whole is greater than the sum of all parts.

The simple fact here is that investors are growing weary. They want to trust the system in which they work, and if that’s not going to happen by way of regulatory oversight, it’s going to happen by way of the rule of the masses as the masses band together to give hedge funds a taste of their own medicine.

APES ON SAME TEAM,1615862025.0,"I’ve never made a post in the AMC forum (I’m a GME ape that holds some AMC shares), but I wanted to make AMC apes aware of something I’ve noticed. Be wary of anyone that tries to slander either GME or AMC. Be wary of anyone that tries to get you to sell EITHER STOCK. The motto is “Buy and Hodl” for a reason, and even though I’m primarily a GME ape, I will NOT sell my stake in AMC because I know it will hurt the chances of AMC mooning. I’ve seen posts in both forums that are trying to pit the two sides of apes against each other in an attempt to get people to sell.

When GME was rising towards $350 last week before the HF f*ckery, I noticed some comments saying “AMC people should sell and come to GME because AMC is a trick play and will never moon,” and today with AMC rising I see posts saying “GME is a brick and mortar company that will never turn around so I’m selling my GME and jumping into AMC.” Do you see the problem with both statements? They want both GME and AMC investors to SELL. Period. Don’t believe the FUD and point it out in both forums. We both can moon but only if that nasty S-word stays out of our mouths and actions. Stay strong apes. 🦍🦧🦍🦧💎🙌🏽💎🙌🏽

great DD that needs to be shared/reposted for every AMC ape to read.,1616314968.0,"Events of March 19 (IMO) I am close to 60 years of age, hold degrees in economics, finance and accounting, so numbers are what they are to me. I have been trading and investing over 20 years on a daily basis and have a pretty solid bank of experience with regard to the stock market, So what happened on Friday March 19?

A couple of obvious points, early on there was a coordinate effort to drop the stock price toward $13 a share. That failed because of the amount of buying pressure that was put on the dive down in price. By 10 am it was apparent that the stock was not dropping below $13.50 a share and the line was drawn at $14.00 by what appears to have been a massive coordinated effort by several investment firms. As an avid watcher of levels 2 and 3 with regard to the stocks I have an interest in, this is the first and only time I can recall seeing 8-10 market makers all in unison controlling the ask price of a ticker. Like a professional dance company all of them moved in unison on the ask. Up a penny, down a half penny, etc etc and all within milliseconds of each other. This dance continued for hours on end, never allowing the price to run up.  
At close, these market makers all hit the bid with over 40 million shares. My question, where did all those shares come from and where did they go on the bid.

We will never be able to prove any illegal activity regardless of what happened at the end of the day yesterday. The SEC sure as hell isn't going to look into anything. Remember, it is the hedge funds that are accusing us of manipulating the stock price, which is not true at all because we all love the stock, and I love the company. Been going to the theaters since they used 16mm reels and Dolby systems did not exist.

OK. So what is the read into everything Well. first and foremost, it was an act of desperation by the hedge funds. They pretty much announced to the world that they know they are screwed on this one and no longer care what tactics they use in their efforts to minimize their upcoming losses. Second, as all of those shares were being sold between 13.90 and 14.02 how many are now in the hands of apes? Of those how many are real shares and how many naked shares will they need to add to the piles of failure to deliver shares, naked shares and the over 187000 call options that expired ITM yesterday? In a nut shell, I think they dug a deeper hole than even they can climb out of.

Now more than ever here I am determined to keep buying and will not sell 1 share until these hedge funds start to cover all of their misdeeds. It's coming, they are going to delay it as long as possible trying to spread fear of a massive drop in price, trying to get current investors to become impatient and sell. Trying to divide the shareholders into groupings that they will intend to attack separately. They will attack the first group, those who think they will sell at $30 a share, then they will go after the next group of those who think $50 a share is enough and so on. Remember its easier for them to attack smaller groups than the entire group of apes. IT IS KEY THAT WE STICK TOGETHER.

The price of our stock is up again this week and although we did not end above $14 a share the week was a win for us again. For the past month we have been winning the battles and eventually we will win the war and the price of this stock will soar.

Patience is needed now more than ever. This will not be the last effort of our common enemy. They will continue to pull every stunt they think they can, and we simply need to not sell any of our shares. For us the battle is getting easier. for them it gets more complex with every stunt they pull and fail at. Make no mistake in reading into this past weeks action, WE WON, THEY LOST. There are hundreds of millions of shares that will need to be purchased to cover short positions which are not just under $14. They still have FTD contracts that go back to when this was under $8. In other words they are still way behind on their obligations. We aren't.

Going to be another good week ahead if we all hold these shares and those who can, me included, continue to buy and hold more shares. Be smart with what you spend here. But be assured that this company is not a $14 a share company even without the squeeze. With operations back at AMC as a minimum this ticker will trade in the $20 range so the future still shows upward movement even without what we all know is coming in the near future.

Sorry about being long winded, I just thought it needed to be out that we are still winning this war and we will resume the fight on Monday the 22nd.

Have a great weekend.",2021-03-21 01:22:48

"Psych Professor, here since January, reminding you of basic psychological tactics at play.",1621050734.0,"If today feels rough, you may be falling victim to basic psychological tactics. We had a run during a day that the DTCC was closely examining HFs during a stress test. They were on their best behavior. The run that followed was what this stock would be doing every day. 

The next day, we're back to blatant manipulation to lower the price. But wait, what was all that yesterday on CNBC about possible margin calls? The thing we all ate up and ran with? Also, weren't there suddenly positive stories about AMC stock out of nowhere? Surely that's going to get some FOMO and explain the trending hash tags and growing support. A squeeze is coming!

But then, why is it dropping today? Oh, the squeeze must be over. Bye, Fomo buyers. Is that steam being let out of our hash tags and support? It sure looks like the squeeze is done to outsiders or the uninformed. Shook some shares loose too.

It's a tactic. It's designed to create a rebounding of emotions and disappointment. 


Don't get tunnel vision. When in doubt, zoom out. Look at what we've done, and not just in price action, since really it matters very little. This is a value investment. The current price reflects nothing of AMC's value.

Apes, I've been here since January and live, breathe, and eat this like you do. I study GME's DDs (kudos to those boys and girls, they put out the best DD) and I support our one-of-a-kind community (we win on that front, I think, we're very cohesive for individual investors who individually like the stock). For God's sake you had the CEO of the company shout you out on a YouTube channel yesterday saying ""Shorts should be shitting in their pants right now"" and had planes flying over cities.


WE ARE KICKING HEDGE FUND ASS. We have never been this close. ""Never forget who may be watching your journey and being inspired"". We *are* making history!

We got here by doing one thing: Individually choosing to buy and hodl.

Remember Adam said he WOULDNT SELL THEM. BUT HE CAN STILL CONVERT THEM. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT DOES TO THE VALUE AND COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY...

Once we get our squeeze in then yea lets approve the 500 million. Do not do it before the squeeze, it will fuck us I am telling you, authorized shares can be converted into common stock and they will find a way to dilute our money and position we currently sit. Remember, Adam said that HE WILL NOT SELL ONE SINGLE AUTHORIZED SHARE. But he does not speak for the board. The board could outvote him and decide to liquidate. Also remember he never said sell an AMC share but they could convert them, or leave them to be borrowed to an insitution cough ""shitadel"" to find funding for AMC and his pocket. Once a suit always a suit. 

Lets get our squeeze first. Vote no. Then after the squeeze if Adam wants the authorized shares then lets do it. I will too invest back in the company to help expand its operations. Right now...I am saying there more harm that could come from the authorized shares approvel then actually help us, those authorized shares will do nothing for our squeeze. 

Think about it apes.THIS IS A PLAY OF A LIFETIME. WE ARE IN CONTROL RIGHT NOW. KEEP IT THAT WAY. IT WILL BREAK MY HEART IF THE RUG GETS PULLED FROM US and with those authorized shares it could. You guys do not know these people. They have been doing this for a longtime.

55% until Liftoff: 140.6M Counterfeit Shares & 45.35% Short Interest,1617102000.0,"**DISCLAIMER:** This is not financial advice. Everything disclosed in the post was done by myself, with public information. I came to my own conclusions, as should you.

**TL;DR:** Ken Griffin's wife is my bitch and I shorted her for Margot Robbie.

**Summary:** AMC has **at least 140.46M** counterfeit shares, borrowed shorts, or naked shorts **(leaning towards borrowed/naked shorts since most illegal trading activity has been done on short selling )** circulating in the **public trading market** with a 45.35% short interest.

**Next-DD:** Short interest is already 100% if external counterfeit shares were included with FINRA data. Will get my uncle who works at Millennium to verify it.

**IMPORTANT: (Research Before You Type)**

* Please educate yourself on the difference between [authorized shares vs. outstanding shares](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/011315/what-difference-between-authorized-shares-and-outstanding-shares.asp#:~:text=Authorized%20shares%20are%20the%20maximum,available%20number%20of%20authorized%20shares) & [restricted stocks vs restricted stock units (](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/tax/09/restricted-stock-tax.asp)RSUs).
* The Q4 Conference Call never stated that the 450M shares were verified as 100% real or fake. It was stated that AMC currently has 450M outstanding shares.
   * Update \[11 PM 03/29/21\]: Apparently, people called and the executives told them they issued 450.16M outstanding shares. **IF this is true, then this DD is completely wrong. This DD could possibly still hold significance.**

Before the Mother of All Short Squeeze arc started, AMC had a total outstanding/issued shares of 85.6M. This could be validated based on their [quarterly filing report](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/0df5f46b-ad2d-4a61-b6d2-b7821f522e26.pdf) on their official website\*\*.\*\* The quarterly filing report is **obligated to report the outstanding shares on the same date as its filing date**. **If any additional shares were issued, AMC would have to file a** [**425B5**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-424b5.asp) **to announce that the company is issuing additional, removing, or amending shares.**  A 425B5 Form clarifies or updates securities [offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/offering.asp) information before [going public](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goingpublic.asp). **Its main purpose is to announce the number of shares that might be available to trade publicly.** Usually, a 425B5 form is used during IPOs but can still be used post-IPO if the company wants to augment the distribution of its shares. The 425B5 form would state the number of shares that are **supposed to be augmented** and **state the current number of outstanding shares.** The most recent one being the [additional 50M shares](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf) on January 25th. If the company ends up deciding to augment the issued shares. A 425B3 form would be required to state it. A 425B3 form is basically a confirmation that the company is 100% changing the number of issued shares. As for AMC, the most recent one was dated back to December 11th,2020 that stated [178M more shares](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/d3d45bba-b3f8-48eb-b39c-cf919f6df22e.pdf) would be issued.

* **Pre-MOASS Outstanding Shares:** 85.6M + 178M = 263.6M Shares

**// 50M Shares Issuance**

**-->** On January 25th, 2021, AMC filed another 425B5 form regarding [the 50M additional issued shares](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/be6b68b6-e865-4013-b54c-3ad07a6b7d5a.pdf) that took everyone off-guard. (AMC announced it was 500M additional shares but the document states 50M. It will matter if it gets issued but right now it doesn't.) On that same document, AMC reported the total outstanding shares were updated to **287M.** Obviously, it's not 263.6M. So was this subtle increase due to naked shorting or another Wanda? To verify this\*\*,\*\* [8K forms](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/8-k.asp) **and 425B3 forms were read from 12/11/2020 until now and none of them mentioned anything related to additional shares.** [Form 3,4,5](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/insider-filings/default.aspx) were also read but weren't required. These forms only report a change in ownership of a company's shares. So regardless if an insider or an institution sells their position, it will only affect the float, not the outstanding shares. The total outstanding shares can only be affected by AMC itself through filings. Based on this, the fake shares as of January 25th accumulated are 23.4M.

* **Possibly Counterfeit Shares:** 287M - 263.6M  = 23.4M

**// Goodbye WandaAMC. Hello 2KAMC**

**-->** On March 12th, 2021, AMC released its [annual report](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001411579/ef37ab99-d475-4102-aab7-88e64e53a3b9.pdf). As stated on page 36, ""As of December 31, 2020, **Wanda owned 51,769,784 shares** of Class B common stock, or 23.08% of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 47.37% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock."" and ""Wanda **forfeited 5,666,000 of their Class B Common Stock**. On February 1, 2021, Wanda exercised its right to convert **its remaining 46,103,784 shares of Class B Common stock into an equivalent number of shares of Class A Common Stock.** Even after conversion. Wanda may have significant influence over our corporate management and affairs, due to their representation on the Board of Directors and their **9.8% stock ownership** as of March 3, 2021, based on our records and information from Wanda."" **As of now, it is unknown whether these forfeited shares were canceled or re-issued. In addition, these are Class B common stocks so these forfeited shares will be omitted**. To find the number of shares Wanda currently owns now with its 9.8% ownership, multiply the current total outstanding shares, 450.16M, by 9.8%.

&#x200B;

[Page 6, Annual Report, AMC Official Website](https://preview.redd.it/54knedtbr2q61.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=84efc57160197c632d983e118885c5e430a1fd0e)

* **Wanda's Converted Class A Common Stock Shares:**
   * 51.7M - 5.6M = 46.1M
* **Wanda's Ownership:**
   * 450.16 \* ( 9.8% / 100 ) = 450.16 \* .098 = 44.1M

&#x200B;

**-->** 44.1M is approximately the number of shares Wanda currently owns. This can be backed up by articles such as [Bezinga](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/03/20168193/why-wanda-group-is-trimming-its-holdings-in-amc-theater-chain) stating ""A common stock in early February, resulting in the Chinese company **owning 44,042,724 shares of Class A common stock**."" Dividing 44.04M shares by 450.16M would yield 9.8% when rounded to the tenths.

* \*\*% of Wanda Ownership: (\*\*44,042,724 / 10\^6) / 450.16M =  44.04M / 450.16M = .0978
   * Percentage Formula: 0.0978 \* 100 = 9.78% = 9.8%

**-->** Remember that Wanda sold off a portion of the converted shares? **Those sold shares can be found by subtracting 44.1M from 46.1M.** This doesn't matter in terms of total shares outstanding but it does matter to the float since these sold shares will increase the float due to it being Class A Common Stocks. Once closely-held shares are sold, they will relocate back into the float. This is why it's important to use websites such as Finviz or CMLviz for their quick updates.

* **Wanda's Sold Shares:** 46.1M - 44.1M  = 2M

**-->** Remember Wanda isn't the ownership of AMC, to find the total ownership, which includes both the insiders & institutions, [CMLviz](https://www.cmlviz.com/stocks/AMC/holders) or [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC) utilized. Finviz's data is all rounded while CML's data are more precise. The current insiders' ownership & [institutions' ownership](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/institutional-ownership.asp#:~:text=Institutional%20ownership%20is%20the%20amount,funds%20on%20behalf%20of%20others) is 0.53% and 10.14% respectively. Then, multiply 450.16M by 10.67% to get the total number of closely-held shares. The reasoning behind this is that these are closely-held shares, aka restricted stocks. **And to determine the** [**float**](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp)**, the outstanding shares have to minus the restricted stocks**.

* Total Outstanding Shares - Restricted Stocks / Closely-held Shares = Float

[Floating Stock Example](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/floating-stock.asp). **The % held in that example is the % of ownership. Stop confusing it with Yahoo!'s one. Yahoo! is outdated af and it isn't even the percentage of ownership. If it is, that means every stock's reported float is wrong. Calculate it yourself.**

* 450.16M \* (10.67% / 100 ) = 450.16M \* .107 = 48.03M

**-->** With these numbers, the float can also be calculated. The float is currently 403.94M on Webull & **multiple trading platforms**. The calculated float is 402.13. Give or take, the percentage of error is less than 1%.

* **Float Calculation:**
   * 450.16M - 48.03M= 402.13M
* **Percentage of Error:**
   * (403.94M - 402.13M ) / 403.94  = .0045%
      * Percentage Formula: .0045 \* 100 = .45%

**// Finding the Outstanding Shares & Float**

**-->** As mentioned earlier, the total outstanding shares can only be changed by filing the forms mentioned above. And from January 25th until now. No filings other than the 10K forms and the Annual Report were filed. No information regarding additional outstanding shares was stated at all and only states that the currently outstanding shares are 450.16M. And in those 10K Forms, none of that was mentioned either.

* [04/01/2021 Acknowledgement of the Short Squeeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

That **means the actual outstanding shares are 263.6M** ( Not 287M since it includes counterfeit shares). **And since Wanda converted their shares to Class A. The 46.1M shares have to be added to the 263.6M.**

* **Total Outstanding Shares as of 03/29/21:**
   * 263.6M + 46.1M = 309.7M

**-->** Since it's uncertain **whether the closely-held shares are determined by their percentage of the outstanding shares or by their share count**, it has to be calculated in two ways. This is bound to be less accurate so don't rely on this number. Method One, given that the percentage of restricted stocks is still at 9.8% when the total outstanding shares are 309.7M. Multiply 309.7M by 10.67% to find the total number of shares owned, then subtract the total number of shares owned from 309.7M.

* **% Ownership of Calculated Float**
   * 309.7M \* ( 10.67% / 100 ) = 309.7M \* 0.1067 = 33.04M
* **Float #1**
   * 309.7M - 33.04M = 276.66M

**-->** Method two assumes that 48.03M is the number of restricted stocks regardless of the outstanding shares. Thus, subtract 48.03M from 309.7M

* **Float #2**
   * 309.7M - 48.03M = 261.67M

|||

**/// Finale**

**-->** Finally, to extract the fake shares flowing buoyantly in the market. Subtract the reported outstanding shares from the calculated outstanding shares. Then, divide the fake shares by the calculated outstanding shares. For the short interest of float, divide the fake shares by the calculated float.

* **Naked + Borrowed Shorts / Borrowed Shorts / Naked Shorts :**
   * 450.16M - 309.7M = 140.6M
* **Short Interest % Outstanding Shares**
   * 140.6M / 309.7M = 0.4535
      * Percentage Formula: .4535 \* 100 = 45.35%
* **Short Interest % Float:**
   * **Method One:**
      * (140.6M / 276.66M) \* 100  = 50.82%
   * **Method Two:**
      * (140.6M / 261.67M ) \* 100 =  53.7%
   * **Average:**
      * ( 53.7% + 50.82% ) / 2 =  52.26%

**--> To conclude,** AMC has **at least 140.46M counterfeit shares, naked shorts, or borrowed shorts** circulating in the **public trading market** (leaning towards **borrowed/naked shorts** since most illegal trading activity has been done on short selling ). The actual total outstanding shares are **309.7M.** The short interest of the outstanding shares is **45.35%**. The short interest of the float can either be 50.82% or 53.7% or in between. The average short interest of the float is **52.26%**. **All numbers are based on the given information and public data.**

**--> Side Note:** FinViz, one of the top stock quote websites that updates real-time data every 15 minutes, reports AMC with total outstanding shares of 480M and a  float of 233M. 170M counterfeit shares with a 55% SI then? Nani the fuck? I don't even know why is there no law regarding the necessity of all websites to report the same data from the same database...

  I'm just going to throw this out there, I’m more than a simple retard, I’m an ape and a mute so I don’t share or comment much. I do however have three bachelors and a doctorate in multiple areas of science so I know a decent amount about understanding psychology, scientific observation, and the nature of human (and 🦍 ). Pattern recognition and reasoning are literally what I paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition to be a Doctor of. This is not financial advice, nor am I remotely a financial advisor. Again this is probably all Bullshit and I just wasted both our time lol

Again this will all be opinion based but after scanning and researching the sentiment and logic of the market, MSM, Reddit, and social media in general, I have made keen observations about where we stand today. 

First off- **there is ever increasing despise and loathing towards hedge funds and anyone holding short positions that have lead millions of people to feel inclined enough to join this movement and begin to Invest in the stock market.** There have been unprecedented amounts of first time investors dumping thousands of dollars in hopes of making it rich because “Johnny just made 2 million off crypto or GME or Tesla."" This leads to a lot of people “sheeping it” or simply following the vocal apes blindly. This can be both good and bad and I will divulge on that later.

Secondly- **we are starting to see mass amounts of FUD being thrown on platforms, Shill accounts being found everywhere, (WardenElite, you Son of a Bitch) and lots of animosity from MSM towards anyone participating in the ""Attack on the Shorts"".** Not only do we see this hate and slander towards all ""meme stocks"" but for some reason one stock in particular takes the brute force of it all. Our precious AMC. So many subreddits like [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets), [r/GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME), [r/Superstonk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Superstonk), hell even [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing) thinks AMC is a load of shit wrapped up in even more shit. I dare any of you to mention AMC on these threads. Everyone thinks this is a pump and dump, a FUD attack, a distraction from the main course GME. Even with all the support on twitter and from famed personnel, the majority of sentiment towards AMC is that it is a burning ship and we are too inexperienced and uneducated to realize we need to abandon ship. 

Lastly- **there is record breaking stats and data coming out daily about the obviously manipulated and heavily shorted AMC stock.** Shoutout to the youtubers like Trey's Trades, Roensch Capital, Matt Khors, Tyler Wilson Investing, Jeffrey Forbes, and the countless others covering AMC. Big shout out to our boy JoshuaJammes on twitter. These guys are showing us day after day that this is ""not a dead cat!!!"" However, we are still labeled as more of a joke than that one dog Elon loves. How tf does that work???? 

***Here is the important part-*** Now what happens when you combine all of this? What happens when you have the youngest, most inexperienced, group of investors in one of the most heavily manipulated stocks, with the most negative overall media sentiment (MSM and reddit subs) on it? Alas, we get what will be the most beneficial tool that Hedgies can use, you get a Pseudo Squeeze. 

**What in the hell is a pseudo squeeze and why do I care?** Pseudo is a term used commonly in the medical world to label something that appears to be but actually isn't. By definition it literally means not genuine or sham. Now why would I dare suggest this as a possibility?? Well unfortunately we fit the bill as a target by the Hedgies. Especially due to the reasons mentioned above. Let me help you understand through an example. 

In the near future, maybe next week even, you start seeing even more price action on AMC! Hardly any dips, constant stair stepping towards tendie town. You call your mom, youre freaking out. You could be see this running up to $100, $200, $300 dollars. No way this is really happening! You have been holding since 14.53 back in January and have only seen red or have bought in recently at 15 and are so stoked at your gains! Imagine all the relief you finally feel now that its happening, the rocket has launched! Oh how great it is to see the other subreddit threads wallow while GME is still slowly climbing but no loner the main focus of the squeeze. We have done it guys! now we hit $500 and its sitting there for a few hours while we celebrate like no other!

Now on the other side the Hedgies are slowly preparing to gather as much assets as possible to fire one last hail mary, one that will have unexpected psychological help from fellow apes. After a few hours sitting at $500 (just a speculative figure but the point is it will be way short of what we all believed and what is truly possible) we see a the price start to slip, and fast. Trading halted as we get to $400 in minutes. Oh shit, did i just miss the peak? But trey said!! :( must just be a dip. Ill hold. Trading resumes, slipping now to $280 and fast. Nothing but selling. WTF!!!!!! Did I get played. There is no way. Must be hedgies. Enter MSM, ""AMC short squeeze over, thousands make impossible fortunes"". Enter WSB gain porn. Everyone is posting they sold AMC. Enter Superstonk and GME apes, ""We called it, AMC is FUD, get out now and convert to GME. This is the way."" Were they right the whole time?? Ill Hold. Price slips to $120. GME begins to make big gains. (Hedgies concentrating every asset to squashing AMC and creating FUD/ mass hysteria. Tens of thousands of our fellow AMC apes begin to sell and fast. Trading is halted every minute. Price is tanking like nothing we have seen before. Many apes begin to buy it, they start losing their minds. ""I need to get out fast!!!"" Sell order, sell order, sell order. Nothing, trading is halted again. Panic over takes all of reddit. Reddit shuts down. ""this is what everyone said would happen. This was the squeeze."" Trading resumes, you sell everything at $65 and feel instant relief cause you made some decent gains. I made it! Diamond hands baby! Shit GME is at $300, i need to buy quick with my AMC gains.............. ***WRONG!!!!!!!!!!***

Please please please read through this. This is exactly the definition of Pseudo Squeeze, they created a false/ sham like squeeze as a hail mary to take advantage of overall sentiment, to manipulate the GME and Superstonk sentiment towards us and crush all the rally and hope the AMC community had! They are master manipulators and sociopaths. They havent played their strongest cards yet. This really is only the beginning. They will short us into oblivion and take advantage of the fact that the majority of the community relies on Youtubers/ Reddit Apes to buy conviction of the cause. You think you are prepared right now but i know from human history that this exact situation will cause you to disregard everything you believed. The only option is to truly immerse yourself in the DD. Everyone cant just read the TLDR, if we don't, the community will fail at the hands of the worlds biggest criminals. If even 51% of the community is a sheep who follows because a lot of people say it is a ticket to the moon, we are f\*\*\*\*d. I can guarantee you they are banking everything they have on this last play. 

In summary: Don’t fall for anything, don’t panic sell, Drown out your emotions and all noise. Maybe disconnect with everything. This will not be the end! If you can Hodl during the most trying psychological battle you'll ever face, then you'll reap the rewards of tendies on tendies!

Edit: well thank you all for the awards!!! But we should give them to our boy Kenny, for giving us the opportunity to take all his money, his associates money, and their friend money lol

Edit 2: alrighty some fools calling me FUD, I hold shares in both GME and AMC. Basis of the post is to educate our fellow unexperienced and newer apes. Stop skipping to TLDR, read and study for yourselves. I’m simply stating the sentiment I’ve polled for over the last three months. Y’all know where this can end up! So if you don’t see 100k don’t panic and hodl. Not even if we get ridiculed from other subreddits. They just don’t see the light yet. No idea how you interpret that as FUD lol

Edit 3: I felt this was necessary to add and for everyone to understand. 

The logic I had with it is that naturally the hedgies are in a short position on theoretically hundreds of stocks. I believe AMC and GameStop are the most shorted based on the data we have seen but wouldn’t it make sense to play off sentiment and allow some price action pressure to occur? They do have a calculated margin call threshold, what that number is, I know not. Essentially they stop all shorting and take down their sell walls around that 14.50 range and allow this to gain movement and traction upward. They are banking on the fact that most the community (all those who aren’t actively reading DD, upvoting, sharing logic, etc) mistake the upward and drastic price action as “the squeeze”. I have no idea what numbers we will see because it would be based on a margin call threshold I suspect. Could be even more subtle to the tune of $50. The whole point of the post is this: we have a good majority of apes who are a bit naive/ inexperienced/ and very anxious for money. Those sentiments will pre dominate if the price moves to a point that these underprepared and desperate apes “deem” acceptable enough. Hedgies will use weaponized psychology in the form of shill bots spamming everywhere with xxxx “holders” selling etc. They will try to make us believe that we were simply wrong and they escape. Think about what Melvin capital tried to do earlier with GameStop. GameStop never truly squoze, it’s ran more on hype/ gamma squeeze than anything else. My intention is to allow the newer/ more smoothed brain apes to visualize what battle will look like ahead. You and I both know we have tens of thousands of ape brethren who just became an investor cause his uncle Chad mentioned the system is corrupt and there is a chance to make money. How many people have been trading for under two months in the community? Those are my brothers and sisters I’m worried about and am trying to prepare mentally. We can’t skip the meat of DD,  o more tldr, no more endless memes. Alright maybe some good memes but we need to focus on mental predation and psychological anticipation to be able to truly hit 100k floors. It’s easy to say that shit now but we all know mentally it’s going to be extremely different for a cast majority of the community. We have the chance to change that now!!",2021-05-24 10:32:55

"I'm selling my crypto and purchasing 25,000 AMC shares",1618772188.0,"Hey guys,

&#x200B;

I'm new to this community, but I have been doing my due diligence and am very confident we will be getting a short squeeze soon. I've been making money from Bitcoin since 2020, but yesterday I sold my crypto and I'm going almost all in on AMC. It will take some time to transfer my money to a stock-trading account, so hopefully by the time I buy the shares next week or so it's not too late for me to get in haha. I've noticed when I used to purchase Bitcoin option contracts that there was heavy manipulation by whales such as F2Pool and recently Binance with the Coinbase IPO, and unfortunately with crypto, since there's no SEC regulations on this manipulation, in addition to a 1T market cap, there's little people like me can do about it, but AMC is a completely different story. With the SEC soon to clamp down on Citadel, as well as all the desperate tactics HFs have been displaying, along with record high short interests, the strong movement this community has, and everything else adding to the fire, I KNOW that this will be a legendary short squeeze. And I think a lot of people have no idea how big this thing will get. This spring has been coiling up for months, and when it blasts, it will be biblical. Then, when we get mainstream adoption, you'll have people like Elon Musk and Marc Cuban supporting the movement and bringing the price another 10x higher, and putting to shame the Hedge Funds trying to shut down movie theaters as well as screw retail investors like us over by trying to manipulate and rig the game in their favor. And these Hedgefund bastards fully realize what they're doing. When they do this dirty manipulation, they are in fact attacking and destroying innocent businesses, stealing jobs from the working class, and they are robbing the humble retail investor that puts their life savings into these company stocks believing that everything is fair and based on basic supply and demand economics, when in fact they don't know about all the dirty manipulation going on behind the scenes and would come to lose their livesavings because of these hedgefunds, causing further financial turmoil to them, their families, and the futures of their children, but these hedgefund managers don't give a rats ass about any of the lives they destroy by doing what they do, as long as it fills their pockets and pays for their 27th mansion. Well, enough is enough. We need to do this, and we need to do this right. Hold on tight to your shares, and keep spreading the word on AMC. When the hammer drops, and it will soon, the diamond hands will make economic history.",2021-04-18 11:56:28

AMC is your once in a lifetime Matrix glitch,1619804714.0,"This situation should not have happened. We are not supposed to have any decision power. The system is not designed to be fair or democratic, the insider information, the tools, the lobbying, the networks, the bending of the rules...even the bail outs...we never had access to that, we only see it in movies ! First they owned the land and if you would be lucky, you and your entire family would work for them. Then they developed businesses and created financial empires, now you have got to prove that you deserve working for them...you start by getting credit from their financial institutions so that you can go study at one of their education institutions, only to find yourself applying for a job at some other institution that belongs to them as well. In the mean time if they need to go fight some war abroad so that they can sell weapons and get high reward contracts...guess who's going...not their sons and daughters. We've always been controlled, with a fake sense of freedom of choice and freedom of speech...but in the end, we always pay. Until now.
Every single time a Hedgefund went bankrupt some other hedgie, financial institution or the government benefitted from it...never the retailers. The money always remained in their channels. Until now. 
The AMC situation is so unbelievable to them, it is so unknown and so unpredictable that they don't know what to do, only that can explain their mistakes. They are completely between wall and the sword. We are the Wall, we are not moving, we are strong...we've got nothing to lose. Government and Wall Street are the sword. Another crisis, another bail out, the biggest squeeze ever, debt spillage to all the major financial players in the world...must be avoided at all costs, whoever would be responsible for such a thing would go out in disgrace.

"Hey, soon-to-be rich person! I'm a veteran. Let me tell you about something called battle fatigue.",1617355659.0,"Hey you savage apes holding those golden tickets to the Moon. 

I've noticed a shift in tone lately, sorta all over the place. There's tension and frustration, and maybe a little FUD. We had a much higher spirit a month ago, and the memes were hilarious. Maybe we can get back to that place of excitement and joy. We ended every post with 'see you on the moon'. We used emojis to express our excitement. WE ENCOURAGED EACH OTHER. We were happy to be moon bound. That's changed a bit. 

 This is a legendary moment of our lives. We're about to take part in a historic, perhaps the most historic, transfer of wealth in the history of the stock market. Folks, look around. You've spooked everyone up to the SEC. They're slowly responding. Maybe not as fast or dramatically as we think is warranted, but that's the government. They're MOVING inside of a couple of months. YOU woke them up. Folks, a squeeze is written into the fabric of space itself with the data we have. It is inevitable. It's coming. You don't even have to do anything. You did the job. Buy if you can sure buy more, but all that you HAVE to do is just hodl. That simple. You bought the ticket, just ride the ride.



This is psychological warfare. Without a doubt, without question. You are playing a chess game, whether it's during the bells and trading stock, or 24/7 being here. It's a mind game, not a money game. The enemy is shorting your confidence. They are shorting your determination.

In the military, we understand battle fatigue. It's a real thing. If you're feeling it, that's normal. It passes. You're giving your all mentally to something and it can be tiring. Take a break. Your golden tickets handle themselves. You can walk away and spend some time doing something fun. They are not going anywhere, and this will be a squeeze heard 'round the world. 

Do you know how you win at the mind games? LOL Don't play 'em. Post memes. Post dream posts about what charities you wanna donate to. What are you gonna do when you make a giant like Citadel hemorrhage money, and all due to their own greed? 


Post funny memes and reminders to everyone here that if we're feeling the heat IT'S BECAUSE THE BATTLE IS RAMPING UP! We're still here! We had the CEO shout us out, folks! HE OUTRIGHT SAID WE SAVED AMC! HOLY SHIT, APES!!

I have been a proud crayon eating member of the Gorilla Gang since December and have fought in both the battle of 8.01 & 10.01. In this time, I’ve found a lot of comfort, education and community in this forum… for this I am profoundly grateful! Actually, I’m grateful for it all… all of the effort and amazing information/DD offered by Reddit, Discord, and YouTube has been a huge catalyst to help me stay focused, keep a macro view and feel safe in accumulating a larger position. When I needed an explanation or to be talked off a ledge you were there, and I’m sharing this with the hope that it helps just one ape…

IT’S NOT WHAT YOU MAKE, IT’S WHAT YOU KEEP!!!!!

1. Make sure to set aside the appropriate amount to pay Uncle Sam! Know your tax liability! The IRS is going to take a big chunk, so you'll only get 60% of your total sale price! So $500,000 per share only nets you $300,000!
2. Do not! Publicize what you’ve earned, that’s between you and your accountant.
3. You may want to change your phone number. There will be many sales/investment calls.
4. Get a financial advisor you can work with to build a plan for your financial future.
5. If shopping for Lambo’s or any other car…look at certified pre-owned (let the 1st guy take the hit)
6. Find a charity that you can get behind and give back… donate/volunteer.
7. Send a random kid to summer camp, provide Christmas for a family that is struggling!
8. Money doesn’t make you smart, pretty or important!  IMHO money equals time, the more money you have, the more time you get to enjoy your life.
9. Remember that you deserve this opportunity… regardless as to where you are from or what story your past tells… it’s finally your turn! Please don’t waste it!

This will never happen again, not like this! Whelp … that’s it for me, I’m out of crayons and need to actually go to work now, which is getting harder everyday we get closer to blast off! Much love to you all and I’ll see you on the MOON! I HODL FOR YOU!",2021-05-13 15:55:12

I was fired the next day... because I made the mistake of being honest... Of telling them its affecting my attitude and performance... and for pointing out that according to policy I'm supposed to have 5 days off in a 12mo period and we're now at 19 months without one.

How many of us give 100%+ at work and are still steam rolled because we don't have more to give. 

How many of us can see our own financial ruin... maybe a day, a week, maybe a couple of months away and are praying to find a way to make it stretch just a little but further. 

How many of us wouldn't treat people the way we are being treated if only the tables were turned.

https://preview.redd.it/tlt58dzml8w61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=b89880bf3810630d7da414f11b22085250ade03c

We can then use FINRA to obtain the shares owned by each of the above which totals **217,262,242**; again, as seen in the image below.

https://preview.redd.it/aos5qozbl8w61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=d60580bcb14569c85d076e54009117286e118ee6

So, we now understand that **217,262,242** shares are owned by insiders, funds & institutions... but wait a minute, does that number seem a little bit high to you?

If the float of AMC is known to be **417,670,000** using quick math shows us **20.9%** of the float is **87,293,030**... Hmmm 🤔 - So, it would appear other than retail claim to own substantially more than **20.9%** of the float, so my question now is what is **217,262,242** 20.9% of? - thankfully someone smarter than myself has made a calculator online that can work this out for us...

**217,262,242** is **20.9%** of:

**1,039,532,258**

Or

**One billion, thirty-nine million, five hundred and thirty-two thousand two hundred and fifty-eight**

Or

**249% of the float...**

**My Final thoughts:**

Knowing that the stonk is proven to be excessively shorted with the information we have access to, I personally feel we do not need to worry about paper hands as the float needs to be purchased twice or more before the Hedgies begin to cover their shorts, paper hands will be shaken during the test launch, and during this we’ll have the support of FOMO traders who’ll jump onto the rocket and keep it fueled this will last for weeks with rips and dips we cannot even begin to imagine.

I don’t know when, but it will come as long as we continue to **BUY & HODL!**

**AMC will go, BRRRRRRR!!!** \- this I am certain

**Ape together; strong.**

"Simple math says AMC can easily be $450,000 minimum.",1621806721.0,"So here’s the deal, this isn’t financial advice but my own opinion and handy calculator.

A lot of apes are still stuck on $100k and from one perspective I get it. We were making that the holy grail but times have changed fam. Before I tell you how i’m super sure we’ll reach $500k I want you to take a second and do 2 things. 1. Think about it, this will never happen again ever. This isn’t a short squeeze apes this is a short fuck and not the good kind either. 2. Inform your fellow apes wether they’re friends, family, strangers no matter what inform them of the new $500k floor and remind them that it’s a floor not a ceiling. 

So how do we come to this minimum $450k number? Quick math.

Last month the common consensus was that the synthetics are 900% of the outstanding shares. So 450,000,000 +900% = 4,500,000,000

BILLIONS!!!!

They have to buy all of these to cover.

So lets be super conservative through this, lets say every order consists of 100 shares (which we all know to sell most 10 at a time and not to dump), thats 45,000,000 orders. Say every order pumps up the price a single cent, 45,000,000 x 0.01 = $450,000. This is taking to account that computers will be the ones buying this up and if apes actually hold then it won’t go cent by cent it’ll go dollar by dollar to far past $500k. Personally my floor for amc is $1M and I believe in us to Hold✊🏽.

Knowing this, ask yourself...we’ve been right all along. Why the FUCK would anyone even consider selling before quadruple digits? 

We’ve been lied to, manipulated, called stupid, threatened, laughed at, and constantly harassed for standing up for what we believe in. I’ll be god damned if I let this opportunity slip away. I’m holding for all my fellow apes. This is more than a -get rich quick - tactic. This is the start of a revolution. My friends, if we stay together we can accomplish anything.

This is actually a blessing in disguise! (I’m glad AMC didn’t gamma squeeze this week),1614925625.0,"Here’s something we should all consider:

Whatever is happening to AMC now is actually a blessing in disguise!

Last week we closed over $8.01 and everyone thought there was going to be a gamma squeeze Monday - Wednesday

But a gamma squeeze didn’t happen...

Some people’s hopes were crushed.

That’s because the HFs decided to “Failure To Deliver” and the majority of people didn’t know such terminology existed before (They did it to scare us into selling out early by crushing our hopes but we quickly caught on to their plan).

The reason why this is a blessing in disguise is because people started asking:

“Where is the gamma squeeze? Wtf is happening to AMC?!”

This eventually led to everyone quickly learning about FTD and interest rates.

How? Because it’s literally being talked about everywhere on Reddit and YouTube now.

This event has educated people and strengthened the hearts of retail investors while the prices of AMC still remains low for us which still gives us the chance to buy in after we consumed great information this week.

I rather people go through a learning phase rather than having a immediate gamma squeeze and then selling off immediately when something bad happens 

On top of that, the short interest rates are increasing daily which means eventually their manipulation tricks are going to bite them in the ass big time. (Karma?)

AMC is gaining thousands of new investors every day. We can easily see that by just looking at the amount of Reddit members joining this subreddit each day and looking at the growth rate of all these YouTubers talking about AMC.

For example: If you check Trey’s Trades statistics on Social Blade, you can see that he is gaining 4,000 YouTube subscribers daily (well deserved along with the other creators). This directly correlates with the amount of new educated investors joining the movement. Don’t forget there’s ton of YouTubers, social media pages, and influencers who are basically “controlling the market” in a good way for us and are significantly growing each day.

God bless the digital age, the hedge funds never dealt with a situation like this before. To them, we are a fucking virus spreading uncontrollably.

🚀 Here’s what’s happening now:

✅ We are gaining thousands of new smart investors daily 

✅ We are getting more educated and less fearful as days go by

✅ We are getting more diamond hand and less paper hand traders daily 

✅ We learned to be more patient and to not lose hope when hyped dates doesn’t meet our expectations 

✅ Stimulus checks and tax returns are on the way

✅ AMC is opening up across the country

✅ FTD and interest rates are piling up

✅ The utilization rate is 99%

✅ The majority of people learned to disable stock lending in settings

✅ We became more comfortable buying the dips to average out

✅ YouTube influencers and r/amcstock are growing by the thousands daily

✅ People are losing trust in “mainstream” media when discovering their manipulation tricks (crap news titles)

✅ Articles, hate comments, and YouTube videos talking crap about AMC/GME is receiving more dislikes than likes (Tarnishing their credibility by calling them out)

✅ People understand that even if this doesn’t squeeze (worst case scenario) , we can still double our money if we hold until the summer (Post covid)

✅ Trading platforms like RobinHood learned not to mess with us again which means more stable squeezes next time

✅ We appreciate how AMC is holding strong while the whole market in general is red these last few days

This is all happening while the price per share is still pennies to the dollar.

Let’s face it folks, the hedgies fucked up by giving us more time to become mentally stronger while the cost to enter still remains low. That means we will tightly hold it down for the people who jump in later when FOMO kicks in during the next squeeze. This will inevitably cause bigger squeezes than last time. Getting in now is like getting into GME when it was $5-$10. If you are seeing this now, consider yourself lucky for being first in line! 🚀

THEY ARE FUCKED!

WE ARE NOW BIG BRAIN APES.

Citadels Market Manipulation Catch-22: If the apes don't sell,1620792183.0,"&#x200B;

I'm a smooth brained ape, but I just realized something that I find quite interesting and soothing. I'm by no means a stock expert, but I think I have a pretty good grasp concerning the  market manipulation that we have seen.

* **In late January price rose to 19,90, since they covered millions of shorted stock. This covering brought them 7 million FTDs.**

This created a massive problem: Since the share price was 19,90 they were burdened with an immense load of FTD's. They couldn't deliver those shares without rising the price further. Their only option was to short the hell out of the stock and try to generate an feedback loop that would lower the price. So they start doing that and covering those FTDs. They manage to do it, the FTD's are covered, but they have brought the price to 14$ and burdened themselves even with more shorts. So they start shorting it.

The catch-22 i'm going for is this:

* **In order to cover the FTD's the stock has to be shorted**
* **Which burdens them with shorts, but they get rid of FTD**
* **They cover the shorts which bring more FTD**
* **Repeat**

Do you see where I'm going with this? They are locked in a cycle and the original market forces are slowly but steadidy spinning out of their control. All they can control is the price, and it indeed  changes and fluctuates, but due to the zero-sum nature of the marketplace the *value* doesn't change before anyone sells.

Think of it like this - there's 10 apes sitting around a table playing a game of selling and buying bananas. On a closer look two of them are actually lions from the same herd in disguise. Everyone at the table has some money and 10 bananas, the bananas have a price of 1$, but their real value is unknown, but believed to be very high. The two lions (who are actually playing together) sell 1 banana back and forth between each other. They sell it first for 1$, then with 0,98$, 0,99$, and so on. While selling they create huge fuss, telling the apes to do the same, since soon their bananas will be worthless. But in order for the value to change the others have to start selling.

if I understand this correctly and this is what they've been doing through the darkpools, the manipulation of the *price* is true, but the manipulation of the *value* is impossible. I think this has something to do with the so called nash-equilibrium, which states that single player in a game cannot affect the whole.

**The manipulation cannot last, because no one is winning and no one is losing!**

Movement can be generated, but it cannot be sustained by these means. Someone has to pick up the slack and start moving for real. The price moves daily in the stockmarket, but since it is not backed by an actual market force this movement is purely virtual. **Only the price changes, but the underlaying value stays the same.**

In order for these manipulation tactics to work, they have to pick up momentum. The lions selling the bananas for less than 1$ each can only turn a profit from their ponzi scheme if the  apes believe them. They can generate movement in the market, but not move the market.   Even if they would sell those bananas at 0,0000001$ each the value would be the same, because the market *has not* determined their value. That's what the market is - it's a device that tries to find out whats the difference between the *price* and the *value*. While the price can change even without any real change in the *value,* the value does not change with the *price*.

**If no one sells (for a loss) those 2 lions are trading those bananas only between themselves, and no transactions are actually taking place. They are trading pure fiction and pixie dust.**

The daily fluctuations of the price are just that, pixie dust. Try to think about this, about the big picture: The change in the price does not the change the value of your stocks. AMC stock is already valued at 100k+. The price just hasn't gotten there yet.

Patientia omnia vincit.

"Hear me out, I know how we can start the squeeze.",1618824865.0,"The answer has been right in front of our faces this entire time. 

If AMC started issuing a dividend anyone holding a short position would have to pay that dividend to whoever they sold the short share. AMC doesn’t have a lot of money for dividends but it does have 43 million shares. If AMC were to do what is called a “special dividend” (that’s really what it’s called when a company gives away a one time dividend) they could give away 1 share for every 10.468 shares the shareholder has. 

The shorts would have to buy shares on the market to give away before they could cover their short position. Throw a dash of options calls in there and we would be looking at the biggest rip AMC has ever had and the best part is apes would hold even more shares, it would eliminate our worries about the 43 million shares diluting the shares and weakening the squeeze. A. Aron if you do this AMC will be the most profitable theater the world has ever seen. I’ll be spending a lot of my time watching movies chugging Diet Coke, and eating chikum tendies inside an AMC theater for the rest of my life.

🍋🍋🍋 JUICY BREAKING DD -- Congressional draft bill just posted that would reign in (and highly penalize) market makers like none other than Citadel and Virtu (two of the largest AMC shorting HFs). 🍋🍋🍋,1620209173.0,"**Today, the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services updated their announcement for this Thursday's (May 6) hearing on all the fuckery that's been going on lately. As you may know, this time witnesses testifying will be newly-appointed SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and the heads of the DTCC and FINRA and I'm looking forward to a grilling from Chairwoman Rep. Maxine Waters and AOC, among others.** 

**Hearing announcement:**

[https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=407748](https://financialservices.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=407748)

What's interesting is that the committee uploaded a few draft bills that will be the subject of the hearing. The one that caught my eye is the following which **will hold market makers like Citadel and Virtu (the two largest market makers shorting AMC right now) to account, and imposes REAL penalties for a change if passed.** 

**Draft bill:**

[https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5.06.2021\_bills-117pih-tradeahead.pdf](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/5.06.2021_bills-117pih-tradeahead.pdf)

Members of the self-regulating agency, FINRA, which already regulates broker-dealers, already have a rule that applies to them, but not to market makers like Citadel, Virtu and other big shorting hedge funds, **so this bill, if passed, or at least the threat of it being out there, is HUGE.** 

See FINRA rule here: [https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/5320](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/rulebooks/finra-rules/5320)

Also see this great article naming Citadel and Virtu (among others who most likely short AMC) for their high frequency trading market maker activities: [https://medium.com/automation-generation/15-well-known-high-frequency-trading-firms-f45292c56d05](https://medium.com/automation-generation/15-well-known-high-frequency-trading-firms-f45292c56d05)

I know apes get discouraged sometimes, but this is huge. As I've noted in other posts, I'm a lawyer who works in government relations for a living and even though you won't read about this anywhere amongst all the crap FUD articles we always see, **this draft bill is a HUGE shot across the bow to players like Citadel, Virtu and even Robbinghood.** It's not about whether it will be passed right away but that it was made part of the May 6 hearing and is a threat to bad actors. And it may just pass too!

We are in the middle of a black swan situation. A stochastically improbable situation that most ordinary people will not believe until they see. We have here the rare and extraordinary chance to watch the ions collect and build up to a lightning strike and for once in our lives we can see where it is going to hit. 

Just because something is rare does not mean it won’t happen. An earth quake can happen, a tsunami can happen, a volcanic eruption can happen, a perfect storm can happen, a global pandemic can happen; we have seen these things occur and affect us in real time.  We’ve felt the power of the improbable and we’ve been tossed around by it for all of our lives. This is our chance to be on the winning side of improbability.

We are all here because we’ve noticed something unusual. We’ve found that off-chance happening that will change the world forever. We are so close that we can taste it. We know it’s possible. Black swans do exist, if only you know where to find them. We’ve found one here.

You are debt free. Your slate is wiped clean. You are... financially free. 

You don’t whisper a word of it to your coworkers, or maybe you share your success in excited whispers with them who rode that rocket with you. But you continue on with your day, like it was another day at the office. 

The day ends, and you get in your vehicle to drive home. You start to tremble, tears of overwhelming relief, happiness, and joy streaming down your face as you process your emotions.

🚨DONT BE FOOLED APES🚨 This isnt even a fart worth of the squeeze🤲🏻💎🚀 Anyone claiming that needs to be considered a shill. HODL AMC 500K🦍🚀🦍🚀🦍🚀🤲🏻💎🤑🤑🤑🌚,1621017277.0,"Apes, new and old. I really do believe we are approaching the endgame here, tho much is still to come. First of, ANYONE in here posting about a                «💩realistic💩» so and so price target of less than 💯K and so on. Are either a paperhand, a shill or a dumbass at this point. We have thousands of thousands onf new ppl in here, and new apes are good, but many havent gotten enough «training» so to speak. BEWARE FUD, BOTS AND SHILLS. 

The hedgefunds in all likely hood now how thousands of bots, and shills they pay to come in here, bash the stock and make us sell. Anyone thats been here for long knows whats going on. To al u new apes, I can tell u rn that no ape will be talking about selling at less than 💯K minimum, even thats paperhanding a tiny bit. They will come, they will beg us into selling at 15$ 20$ 50$ 100$ 1000$ etc etc. FUCK. THAT. This is shaping up to be the LAST and GREATEST short squeeze ever. The biggest fucking transfer of wealth in human, fucking history. 

To anyone reading, with a clear idea of whats going on, and diamond hands ready to HODL for the fucking moon, Congratulations my brother, you’ve made it🥳 U’ve gotten on board for the bumbiest and biggest rocket imaginable, now all thats left is to enjoy the ride to 500K🤲🏻💎🚀🚀🚀

So be preppared for massive ups n downs, be prepared for fake squeezes. Where they let the price up, freeze it then drop it to make it seem like ppl r selling, and clain they have covered. Etc. The bought and paid for propganda machine that is the media will say ANYTHING to make us sell. They will straight up lie. Remember GME in Jan? «Oh the hedgies r covered GME will crash.. SELL!» Etc. The same thing will happen here, only much worse prob. ALL THEY WANT, the hedgies, the media, the elites in general, is for US to sell. Thats the only way we lose. The LAST thing they care about is us. 
So I’ll say to them. The LAST fucking I’ll ever do is take ur advice. FUCK YOU!

What a community!!!,1618420910.0,"I saw something yesterday that i have never ever withnessed in my life.  


Somebody posted a post in this subreddit about ramadan ( muslim holy month )  
And as a muslim my gut reaction was, no,,,why post it here as i prepared for hate comments and people making terrorist jokes. 

  
To my surprise when i looked at the comments it was only love and support, and it hounestly shook me to the core, this subreddit is truly beautiful.  
It started of as a way to make some money but it has developed to so much more.  


This has become a ritual, wake up, go to class and go through this subreddit during breaks, at this point i almost dont mind the squeze draging out a bit as long as i'm with my fellow apes!  


I never thought a subreddit for apes, could be the most humane one of all.",2021-04-14 10:21:50
Graduated college with 100k in debt in 2019. Less than $100 in the bank. Moved to Florida with everything in my car for a random sales job. Worked hard and saved up money.

Pick me up at $15.90!!!,1616787796.0,"Bought AMC around January when it went up like insane. Sadly i am 16 and couldnt buy much, i got myself 150 shares. Ive been holding AMC for the past few months because i truly believe in the cause.

TLDR; 🦍🦍💎💎💎🙌🦍🙌🦍💎🦍💎🦍🙌🦍🦍🙌🦍💎🦍💎 
FUCKING BUY AND HOLD
HOOODL

That was most of my savings, but i couldnt care enough if i lose it all. Learning opportunity and going to the moon, its a bargain!!

EDIT: wtf im getting down voted by bots

EDIT 2: for the people asking why i could buy shares, i purchased through my mom's account, nothing illegal here, i dont own the shares, technically.

Edit 3: for doubters, those were my savings for the past 16 years. So if you divide it per year, its barely $150 a year. Which in ape language, less than a share of GME currently.",2021-03-26 12:43:16
