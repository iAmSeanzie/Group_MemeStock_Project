Here are the results.,1620684365.0,"P**reamble:** The ability of Senators to trade stocks has been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional insider trading scandal where Senators used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain. ¬†While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is

**Did Senators beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?**

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to [u/rambat1994](https://www.reddit.com/u/rambat1994/) for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Senator trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by senators who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades)

While senators are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately.

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

https://preview.redd.it/ir6jqgjwsay61.png?width=644&format=png&auto=webp&s=d057f55015d8e25479815bfe760d4dde81240de6

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the senators in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made by the senators. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy‚Äôs what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided on this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some senators are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.¬†

a.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† One Month

b.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† One Quarter

c.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

https://preview.redd.it/mnijwbqwsay61.png?width=948&format=png&auto=webp&s=828da0f685646a73946097f6b0dd86f753de024b

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Senators did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark.

https://preview.redd.it/95cl91nwsay61.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=00ffc2fc430e5b7f3157ae4f264872d3ef95a0b2

If you had invested in the stocks Senators bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit.

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted to be answered was which were the best trades made by Senators over the last 2 years.

https://preview.redd.it/75nyoa5ltay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb5b27919716360fdbaf31f4548f4d21e0401b49

Brian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month, investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Senators were successful as shown below.

https://preview.redd.it/xing6reltay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9c3d13abbb8b060fecf8cee7b312bbdfd6efaf

These are the worst trades made by Senators with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period.

But even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered senators having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades

https://preview.redd.it/k4r34rpusay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=084ac821754d87d42d2f1ac9b822a9015125a443

John Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Senators comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. The next thing I looked at is the Senators that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years.

https://preview.redd.it/igyz3jwdvay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=223b91d21b9201211a21ea24ec2daee0627b9166

The top 3 senators as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.

Finally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S senators

https://preview.redd.it/fd66tjagvay61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e92ab79c5b7316eb95e70dc22bed0b2f8615127

As expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have a $100B+ valuation.

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

1. The time period of the analysis is 2 years during which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in a market downturn/recession
2. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to them (you can find it in the google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Senators.
3. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Senators. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k ‚Äì $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range.

**Conclusion:**

This analysis proves that Senators indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can‚Äôt be proven from the data and is left to the reader‚Äôs judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Senators as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor*

Edit: 

> There are two chambers in the legislative branch: Senate and House. Not all of these people are ‚Äúsenators‚Äù as you describe. 

I mistakenly classified all of the trades under the broad term of Senators! This is a mixture of trades done by both houses. So please keep this in mind while reading the post. Apologies again as politics is not really my strong suit. ",2021-05-10 15:06:05

Cuban says that all American households, no matter their income level, should receive a $1,000 stimulus check every two weeks for the next two months. He proposed this same idea in May and says ""I still believe in doing it the exact same way"" today.

Additionally, families would have to spend each check within 10 days, or they would lose the money, Cuban says. He believes this ""use it or lose it approach"" would be beneficial because it would promote spending, which would help businesses stay open and stimulate the economy.

Without mandating the money be spent within 10 days of receipt, Cuban believes many Americans will save it. ""People are uncertain about their future, so rather than spending, they save,"" he says. He has a point: Many Americans have been saving more amid the pandemic than ever. In April, the personal savings rate hit a record high, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

>Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) reported the first sale of stock jointly owned by her and her husband on Jan. 24, the very day that her committee, the Senate Health Committee, hosted a private, all-senators briefing from administration officials, including the CDC director and Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institutes of Health of the United States, on the coronavirus. 

>‚ÄúAppreciate today‚Äôs briefing from the President‚Äôs top health officials on the novel coronavirus outbreak,‚Äù she tweeted about the briefing at the time.

>That first transaction was a sale of stock in the company Resideo Technologies worth between $50,001 and $100,000. The company‚Äôs stock price has fallen by more than half since then, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average overall has shed approximately 10,000 points, dropping about a third of its value.

>It was the first of 29 stock transactions that Loeffler and her husband made through mid-February, all but two of which were sales. One of Loeffler‚Äôs two purchases was stock worth between $100,000 and $250,000 in Citrix, a technology company that offers teleworking software and which has seen a small bump in its stock price since Loeffler bought in as a result of coronavirus-induced market turmoil.

Hey everyone! Over the years I've collected tons and tons of market resources ranging from blogs to APIs to technical and fundamental analysis tools to books, videos, YouTube channels and beyond. For a while I've been working on organizing them into something we could share here on the sub to help answer all the ""what are some good resources for learning about the stock market?"" and ""how do I get started in stocks?"" type questions that always pop up across all these stock market subs. 

This is by no means complete, but it's already quite thorough and I'd love your help in adding to it.

I've put it all on GitHub so it can be maintained and others can suggest additions and report broken links if/when they pop up, or make suggestions about order/organization or whatever! I will continue to add to it as I get around to it and come across new resources and rediscover old ones. 

In the mean time, please comment here or feel free to issue a pull request if you know how, if there's anything I should add and I will add it in, or if you notice any broken links or issues! I know that I've missed many things so let me know what they are and we'll make this even bigger/better. In particular it'd be nice if we could categorize the books and create lists for different categories kinda like /r/securityanalysis did in their wiki, but I've added a few as a start.

If you can, average DOWN on your holdings. If you've been wishing to buy a specific stock because it's too expensive, well NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY IT!!! This is why we don't invest money we may NEED. Markets WILL be green again, I guarantee it.

66,"I analyzed 66,000+ buy and sell recommendations made by financial analysts over the last 10 years. Here are the results.",1619478540.0,"**Preamble:** I suppose all of us have come across an analyst report while doing DD on a stock. Most of the reports that are freely available to the average investor are either dated or limited in access (we only have the buy/sell ratings and not the deep dive on the stock). According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/put-price-investment-research-2/) Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs charges $30K for access to its basic research, JP Morgan $10K per report, and Barclays charging up to $455K for its equity research package.

What I wanted to know was if you actually pay for the reports and then follow their recommendations, would you be able to beat the market in the long run? Surprisingly, there were no trackers following the performance of analyst picks over the long term and I decided to build one.

**Where is the data from:** Yahoo Finance. I used yfinance API to pull all the analyst recommendations made from 2011 for S&P500 companies. While this is in no way a complete list of recommendations, I felt that the data I had was deep enough for the analysis. Both Bloomberg and Quandl provide richer data but costs more than $20K for their subscription and also won‚Äôt allow you to share the recommendations with the public. (I have shared all the recommendations and my analysis in an Excel Sheet at the end)

**Analysis:** There were a total of 66,516 recommendations made by analysts over the last 10 years for S&P500 companies.

https://preview.redd.it/n790ugjr9jv61.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=07845e5d4b41a4877dd6cd180ae1faa450adfc46

For the three sets, I calculated the stock price change across four periods.

a. One week after recommendation 

b. One month after recommendation 

c. One quarter after recommendation 

I benchmarked the change against S&P500 and also checked what percentage of recommendations increased in value compared to the benchmark. I limited my time horizon to one quarter since analysts usually create reports every quarter and I did not want to overlap different recommendations. Finally, I also checked which banks made the best recommendations over the last decade. 

**Results:** 

https://preview.redd.it/k2lc2u1t9jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffbb6b197286b47782ede7f068f6648eacf492ae

Out of the 35K buy recommendations made by the analysts, the average increase in stock price across the time periods were better than the SPY benchmark with one week returns bettering SPY by more than 40%. Adding to this, I also benchmarked the percentage of times analyst made the call and the stock price went up vs the SP500 index. 

https://preview.redd.it/y39cv6iu9jv61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e24eec21c5018c01febdcdc234136935a0a01b6

 Sell recommendations given by analysts definitely have a short-term impact on the stock price. As we can see from the chart, the one-week performance of stocks that were recommended as a sell was lower than that of the benchmark. But this trend does not hold over the long term with stocks having sell recommendations significantly outperforming the market over the time period of more than one month. Another thing to note here is that on average even after the sell recommendation, the stock price did not fall. (ie, the returns were not negative)

**Which investment banks made the best recommendations?:** 

https://preview.redd.it/5cx0ov1x9jv61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=50549713d2ae8696b3012add7dbc2fe68ddad8a0

I analyzed the returns of the recommendations made by different banks. The most number of recommendations were made by Morgan Stanley with them making more than 2300 recommendations in the last 10 years. From the above chart, you can see that overall, the best returns were made by Barclays with their recommendations beating SP500 by more than 125% in one-week gains and more than 30% in quarterly gains. 

**How much money should you be managing to profitably buy analyst reports?** 

I did a rough calculation on the amount of assets you need to be managing to make sense for actually paying for the reports. From the above analysis, we could see that the analyst reports beat the market by 23%, and on average full access to analyst reports of a bank will set you back by $500K per year. Putting in the above numbers, you need to have a whopping $19MM of assets under management just to break even. Going on a conservative side, to comfortably make profits and not to have the analyst report fee considerably impact your returns, you should be managing at least $100MM.

**Limitations of analysis:** 

The above analysis is far from perfect and has multiple limitations. First, this is not the full list of recommendations made by these companies and are just the ones that were updated on Yahoo Finance. I also could not get any information on price targets made by the analysts to supplement my analysis. Finally, even though this analysis covers the last 10 years, it had been predominantly a bull run and this can bias the results in favor of the banks. This aspect could also be seen by observing how poorly the sell recommendations made by the banks faired. 

**Conclusion:** 

I started the analysis skeptical of the returns generated by recommendations made by analysts. There has been a lot of rumors and speculations about whether analysts have access to information the public doesn‚Äôt. Whatever the case may be, the above analysis shows that if you have access to the analyst reports, you definitely can beat the market over the long run. Whether it's financially viable or not to access the reports depends on the amount of asset you have under management, in this case at least $100MM!

80,please stop telling new investors to invest in crypto.,1621777478.0,"as a new investor, I've been really dabbling into everything and learning. and you know what's the most fucking annoying thing? when I ask a God damn question about something completely unrelated to crypto and someone tells me to ""just buy doge/bitcoin/ethereum/etc"" .

like bro I'm fucking NEW. first off I never asked about crypto and second off shut up. we all know about crypto. we know. we get it. but here's the thing. telling new investors to ""just buy bitcoin it's the future!11!11"" is how you make people lose money. 

hopping on trends and putting your money on a literal fad/trend like doge (I feel like the hype is more emotional than logical), is literally just the most ignorant thing ever. on top of that crypto goes 24/7 and is super volatile. meaning you could buy ethereum, see a +.05% profit, and go to bed. you wake up and since you're new and don't even know stop losses exist, you wake up and see that it dropped significantly in such a short amount of time. 

as a new investor you're more likely to panic sell here. on top of that, if you try to HODL thinking it'll go up, if you put money in something like a fad/trend because ""bro it's the future!!1!11"" and people dip out the trend, it only goes more and more down. 

telling new people to invest in such a highly volatile and scary thing, especially when stuff like doge which felt like a fad in the first place, is beyond aggravating. 

stop it. when a new investor asks a question just answer their question. it is super aggravating for me especially because I get so annoyed by people that just tell me ""bro bitcoin bro bro doge bro!!"" when you're like less than a few months into everything.

EDIT: just for clarification that's not my experience as a new investor with crypto. I don't want to touch crypto until I have more experience but in terms of me being a new investor and asking questions, that's how I feel. constantly just being told to hop on a crypto. Also, it's not a bad investment. I'm not saying you shouldn't invest in crypto. Again, I did not have this happen to me. but I worry this will happen to someone who is way newer than me.",2021-05-23 06:44:38

91,U.S. tech stocks are now worth more than the entire European stock market,1598660959.0,"The dominance of major U.S. tech stocks in recent years has pushed the sector past another milestone as it is now more valuable than the entire European stock market, according to Bank of America Global Research.

The firm said in a note that this is the first time the market cap of the U.S. tech sector, at $9.1 trillion, exceeds Europe, which including the UK and Switzerland is now at $8.9 trillion. For reference, the firm said that in 2007, Europe was four times the size of U.S. technology stocks.

* NASDAQ went from 9785 to 6657 between Feb 20 and Mar 20.  \~32%   (Markets unsustainable! 'Gonna crash' yelled the news. covid helped that along)
* Then it went from 12,300 to 10622 between Sep 2 to Sep 22.  \~14% (Markets unsustainable! 'Gonna crash' yelled the news. i dont even remember why)
* Current drop started around 13,891 on Feb 16.  It's at 12,195 today (Mar 5) \~13%  (Markets unsustainable! 'Gonna crash' yelled the news. something to do with treasury yields)
* any of all the other 15% corrections/crash prior dating back to 2000. (Markets unsustainable! 'Gonna crash' yelled the news)

My goodness, with all the self-therapy posts, it's like none of you were around before last month. Don't try to rationalize the reasons, the magnitude or the duration. it just is.

Money comes and goes. Financial losses hurt and I feel that some of you may have lost more than you can afford to lose. It was easy to get caught up in the frenzy. I did too, made some money, then lost money. I feel your pain.

1. **Please do not consider any harm to yourself.** If you do, please call a help line. I care about many of you and this sub will be a good place again in the near future.
2. Find ways to get your mind off the stock market. Take a walk, watch a movie.
3. Think whether you want to sell. No shame of cutting your losses. Maybe sell some. I bought BB at $20, sold at $14. Sold half of NOK today. Still holding BBBY. Make your own decision.
4. **Do not be aggressive trying to win your money back in one or two plays.** Learn more about the market and be patient. Make smart investments in proven companies with promising growth.
5. I keep replaying the time when I thought to sell and was ready to but didn't. It hurts. I didn't sleep well for few nights. But that moment it gone and not need to relieve it and torture myself.
6. I learned a lot from this experience and will be a better investor in the future.

What helps me cope when I lose money investing:

1. Many other people lose a lot more money than me, go to jail for bad decisions, etc
2. I was lucky to have money to invest, some don't have money for food
3. It's just money. **You can always make money in the future**
4. **Happiness comes from small things that are not connected to money**
5. I have family and friends that care about me.

**Please cheer up**. This is a honest supportive message. Please seek professional help if you are depressed. We'll get through this.",2021-02-04 23:15:00

113,"I've reproduced 130+ research papers about ""predicting the stock market"", coded them from scratch and recorded the results. Here's what I've learnt.",1566005453.0,"ok, so firstly,

all of the papers I found through Google search and Google scholar. Google scholar doesn't actually have every research paper so you need to use both together to find them all. They were all found by using phrases like ""predict stock market"" or ""predict forex"" or ""predict bitcoin"" and terms related to those.

&#x200B;

Next,

I only tested papers written in the past 8 years or so, I think anything older is just going to be heavily Alpha-mined so we can probably just ignore those ones altogether.

&#x200B;

Then,

Anything where it's slightly ambiguous with methodology, I tried every possible permutation to try and capture what the authors may have meant. For example, one paper adds engineered features to the price then says ""then we ran the data through our model"" - it's not clear if it means the original data or the engineered data, so I tried both ways. This happens more than you'd think!

&#x200B;

THEN,

Anything that didn't work, I tried my own ideas with the data they were using or substituted one of their models with others that I knew of.

&#x200B;

Now before we go any further, I should caveat that I was a profitable trader at multiple Tier-1 US banks so I can say with confidence that I made a decent attempt of building whatever the author was trying to get at.

&#x200B;

Oh, and one more thing. All of this work took about 7 months in total.

&#x200B;

Right, let's jump in.

&#x200B;

So with the papers, I found as many as I could, then I read through them and put them in categories and then tested each category at a time because a lot of papers were kinda saying the same things.

**Here are the categories:**

* *News Text Mining.* \- This is where they'd use NLP on headlines or the body of news as a signal.
* *Social data - Twitter Sentiment/Google Search/Seeking Alpha*. Again, some were NLP, for google trends they just used the data.
* *Technical Analysis & Machine Learning together*. Most of these would take the price, add TA features, then feed into a ML model.
* *Other machine learning (as in, not using TA)*. Just using the price and some other engineered features.
* *Analyst Recommendations*. Literally just taking the recommendations from banks/brokers and using that as the signal.
* *Fundamental data*. So ratios from the income statement/balance sheet,

**Results:**

Literally every single paper was either p-hacked, overfit, or a subsample of favourable data was selected (I guess ultimately they're all the same thing but still) OR a few may have had a smidge of Alpha but as soon as you add transaction costs it all disappears.

Every author that's been publicly challenged about the results of their paper says it's stopped working due to ""Alpha decay"" because they made their methodology public. The easiest way to test whether it was truly Alpha decay or just overfitting by the authors is just to reproduce the paper then go further back in time instead of further forwards. For the papers that I could reproduce, all of them failed regardless of whether you go back or forwards. :)

&#x200B;

**Now, results from the two most popular categories were:**

* \*Social data.\*A lot of research papers were extensions of or based off of a paper by Johan Bollen called ""*Twitter mood predicts the stock market*"". It literally has 3,955 citations and is complete and utter horse shit; the paper is p-hacking to the extreme. Not only could I not reproduce the results, but given the number of sentiment indicators he uses I regularly found correlations between sentiment and my data based on how I engineered it. None of these correlations held over longer time periods. Every paper that's a derivative of this one or cites it has the same issues.
* \*Technical analysis & machine learning.\*Every paper would do something along the lines of.. take past price data for some asset (stocks, forex), then add technical analysis indicators as ""features"". Then either they'd run through a feature-selector that figures out the best features then put the best ones into a model OR they'd dump this data straight into the model and afterwards select the subset of instruments that it ""worked"" on. None of these would hold if you k-fold test them or test on different subsets of data outside of the ones used in the paper. The results are always based off of selecting favourable subsets of data.

&#x200B;

**The most frustrating paper:**

I have true hate for the authors of this paper: ""*A deep learning framework for financial time series using stacked autoencoders and long-short term memory*"". Probably the most complex AND vague in terms of methodology and after weeks trying to reproduce their results (and failing) I figured out that they were leaking future data into their training set (this also happens more than you'd think).

&#x200B;

**The two positive take-aways that I did find from all of this research are:**

1. Almost every instrument is mean-reverting on short timelines and trending on longer timelines. This has held true across most of the data that I tested. Putting this information into a strategy would be rather easy and straightforward (although you have no guarantee that it'll continue to work in future).
2. When we were in the depths of the great recession, almost every signal was bearish (seeking alpha contributors, news, google trends). If this holds in the next recession, just using this data alone would give you a strategy that vastly outperforms the index across long time periods.

Hopefully if anyone is getting into this space this will save you an absolute tonne of time and effort.

So in conclusion, if you're building trading strategies. Simple is good :)

&#x200B;

Also one other thing I'd like to add, even the Godfather of value investing, the late Benjamin Graham (Warren Buffet's mentor) used to test his strategies (even though he'd be trading manually) so literally every investor needs to backtest regardless of if you're day-trading or long-term investing or building trading algorithms.",2019-08-16 18:30:53

* [**AMC+22.66%**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC?p=AMC)

(Reuters) -Shares of AMC Entertainment surged another 38% in early deals on Wednesday and were set to open at a record high as individual traders on social media forums were unfazed by a hedge fund flipping its stake in AMC, calling it overvalued.

Hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management sold 8.5 million freshly issued AMC shares at a profit on Tuesday, a source said, immediately after buying them. AMC had earlier said it was prepared to make acquisitions with the new issuance, worth about $230.5 million.

Extending a red hot rally, the cinema operator's stock traded at $41.90 on Wednesday, leading gains among the group of ""meme stocks"" including video game retailer GameStop Corp and BlackBerry Ltd that have attracted the attention of small-time traders on online platforms such as Reddit's WallStreetBets.

""It's not rational, but do not bet against it,"" said a Berlin-based trader.

AMC's stock has surged more than 1,400% this year and, at nearly $42, is trading at more than 10 times the median analyst price target.

The number of messages related to AMC on trading-focused social media site Stocktwits rose more than 7% on Wednesday, with most of them reflecting a positive sentiment.

AMC daily stock trading volumes in the past week have reached their highest since January, according to Refinitiv Eikon, while data from Fidelity showed it continued being the brokerage platform's most traded scrip.

GameStop was up 4.5% in premarket trading, while Koss Corp jumped 13%. BlackBerry's U.S.-listed shares were last up 18.6%, bringing their total yearly gains to more than 75%.

117,Robinhood is Stealing From the Poor and Giving to the Rich,1611881018.0," 

Robinhood has proved time and time again that they are nothing but weaselly little corporate shills who are to busy sucking off hedge fund managers so they can sell our information and make a quick buck off us I'll include multiple reasons why you should take all your money out of Robinhood and put it in other reputable brokerages like interactive brokers and Charles Schwab .

1. Free Trades Are Now Commonplace

Robinhood is no longer the only show in town. Since its arrival, several major brokers have followed suit and now also offer free trades. Today, you can get free trades with Webull, M1, Fidelity, Charles Schwab, E\*TRADE, Interactive Brokers, and many more. It means you need to question whether some of Robinhood's other major shortcomings are still acceptable. In practice, they are probably not.

2. Major Downtime Problems

When a broker is inaccessible on some of the most volatile days of the last 50 years you may get some small outages . But Robinhood has consistently had major outage that led people to lose millions of dollars . Not once. Not twice. Not three times but over five times.

Worse still, all the outages occurred in the space of one week in early March during the most unpredictable days of the COVID19 crisis. It cost people millions of dollars in positions they could not close. And Robinhood's response? A ""goodwill"" payment of $75. It is now facing multiple lawsuits over the issue.

Users can no longer maintain any reasonable faith in the service being available when they need it most. That alone is enough reason to switch broker.

3. Delayed Stock Quotes

If you read Robinhood's FAQs or independent reviews of the service, you will see that the app has real-time quotes.

That's only half true. Yes, your orders will always be completed at the real-time price, but the charts and data you see on screen are often delayed. This will prevent you from getting in and out of trades in the most efficient manner.

4. Terrible Crypto Product

I understand the appeal of being able to do your stock trading and crypto trading in the same place. On paper, that's something that Robinhood offers; it launched its crypto trading service in 2018.

But the crypto platform has some shocking drawbacks. The drawbacks are so severe that we'd strongly urge all users to look elsewhere for your crypto needs.

* Coin withdrawals are not available. If you own Bitcoin, you cannot transfer it out of Robinhood to your own private wallet.
* Robinhood does not supply you with access to your wallet or your wallet address.
* You do not hold the private keys for your crypto assets. An oft-repeated (and accurate) piece of advice in the crypto world is that if you don't have the private keys, you do not own the coins.

5. Payment for Order Flow, Selling Your Data and Poor Execution

Given the free trades, how does Robinhood make money? Sure, there's Robinhood Gold, but the signup rate is nowhere near enough to warrant the $8 billion company valuation.

The answer is via a practice called payment for order flow. It means that instead of searching for the best price for a given stock, Robinhood is instead selling your data to high-frequency trading (HFT) firms for massive profit. The HTF firms add the data to their algorithms to better understand the flow of retail money. It is they who are Robinhood's real customers.

In reality, the no-fee movement may end up being described as a no-explicit-fee movement, as the payment for order flow revenues have grown at many of these firms. Not to rehash the whole argument, but investors trading at firms with higher PFOF are paying a hidden fee in terms of poorer execution on their trades.

This means that they may pay a higher price when buying or get a lower price when selling than they would with another broker less focused on PFOF as a revenue generator. For regular investors making only a few trades a year, PFOF-related slippage may not be a huge burden, but it is a bigger issue for more active investors and traders.

6.Robinhood Gold is a Scam

Robinhood Gold is a subscription service that introduces a few extra features for $5 per month.

* Margin investing.
* Access to professional research such as Morningstar reports.
* Level II market data.
* Larger instant deposits (rather than waiting for money to clear).

Sounds reasonable. But here's the catch---any broker worth its salt will make all that stuff available for free on its respective platform. It really isn't worth $5 per month. Robinhood Gold just feels like a way to eke more cash out of inexperienced investors who think that by subscribing they will become better traders.

7. Poor Customer Service

Robinhood's customer support is notoriously bad. Users complain of waiting weeks for an answer in the app's Help section, lengthy queues to speak to someone on the phone, no responses to emails, and a general lack of urgency in responding to important issues.

In ordinary circumstances, poor customer service might be forgivable in a free app. However, when large sums of money are involved, clients deserve better. Given the company's value, we're sure they could hire a few extra reps easily enough.

According to Ackman, assuming a rate of 8% per year, investing $6,750 in an account at birth would yield assets of more than $1 million by age 65. It would cost the government $26 billion per year, based on the average number of children born in the U.S.

In addition, the billionaire suggested that companies should be required to put a fixed percentage of a worker‚Äôs salary or wages in a tax-free investment account that couldn't be touched until retirement. In that way, it would mimic Australia‚Äôs successful superannuation system.

123,Mark Cuban‚Äôs Secret Shopper Study Finds That 96% of Dallas Businesses Don‚Äôt Comply With Reopening Guidelines. This is going to get bad.,1589059767.0,"""According to the [findings posted to Cuban‚Äôs website](https://blogmaverick.com/2020/05/07/i-hired-a-team-of-secret-shoppers-to-find-out-how-businesses-were-opening-in-dallas-its-not-good/), only 36 percent of all businesses included in the study that were allowed to reopen on May 1 actually chose to open their doors. Of those businesses, a staggering 96 percent failed to comply with all of the Open Texas guidelines. The shoppers observed that restaurants were more likely to comply with some requirements, like separating tables and asking employees to wear masks, than they were with guidelines like offering single use condiments or contactless payment."" Definitely check out the full study.

**If this trend continues as states reopen, it's bad news for the economy.**

To mostly everyone, these staggering unemployment numbers don't feel real yet. People think this pandemic is just going to blow right over, and life is just weeks away from returning to normal. Optimism is especially high because those $1,200 stimulus checks are three times the amount of cash over 40% of American's have in their savings account on any given day. Plus, Unemployment is paying millions of people more than they regularly make at their jobs. A very large portion of Americans probably feel more ""financially secure"" right now than any other time in recent memory. Now, interest rates are almost 0% and people are deciding it's a great time to buy a car or house. However, as economic activity starts trending down from lack of public confidence in local governments ability to stop the Coronavirus, that financial security will evaporate extremely quickly.

People are ready to return to normal, and the market is reflecting that. We saw it in economic activity this last week with all the reopenings. However,  The fact of the matter is a virus with a .5%-1% death rate is spreading rapidly, and it's going to have to infect 220,000,000 Americans before it stops, unless we stop it first. That's 1 person in every 10th family dead (assuming each family has 16 people across 3-4 generations) . This virus also does permanent damage to the lungs, heart, kidneys, and/or the central nervous system in 10% of cases, and will require lifetime treatment (1 in every 4 families). [source](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/8/21251899/coronavirus-long-term-effects-symptoms)

We dont have adequate testing, not enough people are wearing masks, and Mark Cuban's study in Dallas showed less than 4% of businesses were following every public health guideline in their reopened economy. The longer people take to realize what's going on and react accordingly, the harder the economy is going to crash when they do. We're in the second inning of a nine inning stretch, and If  businesses don't start following these health guidelines in the next two weeks, things are going to get really messy, and people will stay home on their own. It's a mathematical certainty.

Edit: I'm trying to explain the bubble our economy is currently in, and why it's about to burst. The stock market is tied to the economy (i know right?), and when people start pulling money out of their 401ks and missing credit card payments, markets will crash. What happens when all that stock companies bought back drops in value by 50%? What happens when credit unions start going insolvent?

Edit Edit: I don't believe lockdowns are what would cause this either. The economy will grind to a halt on its own once Cov19 is widespread in rural and suburban communities. I actually believe the lockdowns and quick action by congress is what instilled the market confidence in the first place. Doing the reopening properly would instill even more confidence.

I tried posting this on the Robinhood sub but someone else already posted it and was removed by the sub's mods. I wonder why. 

I've also experienced quite a handful of bugs using Robinhood, or at least when I still used the app. Just off the top of my head I can remember a countless amount of UI bugs that prevented me from selling or buying a stock during early market hours. 

There were also bugs that delayed real prices of a stock by several minutes, sometimes up to half an hour forcing me to use other sources with more accurate price information like Google Finance or TD to submit properly priced orders. 

Another frustrating bug I remember is the instant deposit almost never working in a timely fashion. It was always late by several days. 

The final straw when I outright transferred all my money and deleted the app was about 3 years ago when Robinhood's services were down for an ENTIRE HOUR while I was daytrading $BABA a couple days after an earnings beat. I lost about $600 in that hour, but it could have been much, much worse. 

The bug this young investor experienced is not something rare or uncommon with Robinhood. More people need to understand this company has a long history of corrupt support, terrible servers and networks, and countless UI bugs. Given this tragic news, don't make the same mistake.

> The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an investigation of the trading in shares of Eastman Kodak Co. before and after the news last week of a $765 million government loan to help it make drugs at its U.S. factories, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The loan news caused Kodak's shares to climb to as high as $60, before falling back to $15 on Monday, in massive trading volume. The stock had already moved 25% the day before the news was officially disclosed. Executives with stock options, including some awarded the day before the loan became public, were sitting on big paper gains. Kodak shares were down 1.3% Tuesday, but are up 215% in the year to date, while the S&P 500 SPX, 0.10% has gained 2%.

128,Nine tips for reading Annual Reports by an Accountant,1620492714.0," 

Nine tips for reading Annual Reports from an Accountant. Annual reports often run into 100's of pages. Here is what you need to know.

Thread üßµ‚¨áÔ∏è

**1. Read Back to Front.**

Miss the glossy marketing pages and skip straight to the numbers. Before reading what the managers say about how well they have done, it is a good idea to have formed our own opinion.

**2. Focus on Profit**

There are so many ways profit is calculated the directors can be talking about a completely different number to the one considered most relevant.

Check the profit adjustment items under

* Exceptional
* Non-recurring
* One-off

Decide if they should be included.

**3. Even Better Focus on Free Cashflow Over Profits**

The best investors don‚Äôt spend huge amounts of time looking at a company‚Äôs profits. Instead, they spend a lot of time looking at its free cash flow in order to work out how good or bad a company‚Äôs shares might be as an investment

What is free cash flow? In layman‚Äôs terms it is the amount of cash that a company has leftover every year to pay its lenders and shareholders. It is essentially a company‚Äôs cash profits. Or essentially the cash which can be extracted from the company, whilst the company still maintaining its current growth.

**A sign of a company with high-quality profits is that it turns a large proportion of its profits into free cash flow**

**4. Check the Segmental Report.**

When a company is changing shape, using cash flow from one division with limited prospects to build up another which will diversify and grow its revenue. The Segmental report highlights this.

**5. Check the Remuneration Report.**

This is where executive pay is disclosed. Excessive pay counts against a company in my evaluations. It can mean the board is more interested in filling its own pockets than rewarding employees and shareholders fairly.

**6. Don't Overlook the Risk Section.**

Companies do not like to talk about why they might lose money, which is what makes this section so compelling. Companies spell out the commercial challenges they face, and also present convincing arguments as to why they might overcome them.

**7. How does it make money?**

Read the business model section. A business model is how a company makes money. A strategy is how it plans to make more. To be credible, strategies must make sense, and they must be reflected in the results of the company.

**8. Skip the Chairman Notes**

Read the CFO notes. The chief financial officer will often repeat what the chief executive and chairman say but add more commentary on the numbers and how they were derived.

**9. Check Accounting Treatments**

Auditor‚Äôs report

Auditors very rarely qualify their opinion on the financial statements, but it can be useful to note which areas of accounting they focused their investigation on.

129,Leaked Treasury documents reveal that major banks are knowingly moving money for organized crime without doing anything about it,1600663403.0,"A collection of files from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network that is largely composed of so-called ""suspicious activity reports"" covering $2 trillion in transactions from 1999 to 2017 shows that major banks, such as **JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Deutsche Bank**, and **Bank of New York Mellon** knowingly move money for **drug cartels**, the **Taliban** and other **organized crime enterprises**.

While at least some of these transactions are caught and documented in internal audits, which may then even be reported to the authorities, neither the banks nor the authorities are making much of an effort to put an end to these. The authors of the article suggest that the banks just want to keep the business while officials fear cracking down on the banks as it might set negative precedents that would require them to take legal action against dozens of banks, causing enormous economic damage and political fallout.

While this shouldn't be much of a surprise to anyone, it's interesting to see how this system emerged over the past two decades. I also wasn't aware that the authorities were complicit in it to this extent. I suspect that this leak won't have much of an impact, though - neither on the banks, nor on the market. I will definitely keep an eye on some of the big finance symbols on Monday, though.

133,"Trevor Milton is likely a sociopath. You heard it here first, DD inside.",1595377453.0,"After watching several interviews with Trevor Milton, I noticed that he engages in behavior that is similar to other fraudster CEOs, such as Elizabeth Holmes, Jeffrey Skilling, Adam Neumann, Billy McFarland, etc.

Almost every interview of his includes contradictory information. It would probably take an hour-long YouTube video to explain all of the instances, but I'll just go by a few here that you can watch yourself. A few quick instances first:

* His company obviously copied Tesla by naming their company after Nikola Tesla, just choosing the first name instead. Then Trevor has the audacity to say that he can ""out-Elon Elon"". K, based on what? All of your past failures?

* His company is a patent-troll. They sued Tesla for $2 BILLION, over something so incredibly stupid, and *expected* Tesla to pay out because ""they have billions anyways"". This is on the level of those people who fake-trip in a Walmart and sue because ""they have billions anyways"". It's trolling/sociopathic behavior.

* Trevor said ""they're focusing on products that generate revenue"", which is why they got into hydrogen fuel cell (HFC) long-haul trucks. This was *completely contradicted* by their introduction of a pick-up truck, off-road 4x4, and a HFC jetski. Like, those are fun products, about 95% of customers buy those products for fun, not to make money off of. 

* He cashed out $70,000,000 in NKLA stock and purchased a $35,000,000 home before the company even sold a single truck.

* NKLA applied for a $4 Million PPP loan, despite Trevor cashing out $70,000,000 in stock, and his company being worth Billions (on paper, but they still have a credit line). 

* On numerous occasions and interviews, Trevor talked about their company being ""vertically integrated"", i.e. owning the entire process from design, to production, to hydrogen fueling. What's really happening is their trucks are being built by a company all the way in Italy (or Germany), and then shipped to the US. He also has no plans on building out the Hydrogen fueling infrastructure. The ""renderings"" they keep showing he says will only cost ""$10-15 Million each"". That's ridiculous, the renderings for his HFC truck-stops are massive complexes that take up tons of land. Yeah, that's okay for Arizona and Utah, but not in the urban environments where most Trucks operate. And if you only have HFC-filling stations on the outskirts of cities, they'll be busy all the time which will increase transit times and cost more money. It's not like a Tesla Charging station that can just be built in a parking lot or near a loading dock. 

* Videos of their ""warehouse"" are all empty. It's not like Tesla's Fremont plant where there are thousands of workers. 

* NKLA went public through a ""reverse merger"", which isn't always bad, but it's still a sneaky/backdoor way to become publicly traded and in my opinion is worth staying away from on that basis alone. 

* The terms of their lock-out period expiration are just ridiculous. Some people are becoming millionaires before anything has even been sold. All they did was photoshop a few renderings for a few months, and that's somehow worth millions??

* They don't even plan on having any trucks for sale for *years*. That means the next few years they're just going to be burning investors cash. Reminds me of DryShips, MoviePass, Theranos, etc.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qn2p3Lrn4A

* Their ""Badger"" truck is nothing more than a rendering, and they're already accepting deposits for it?? That doesn't make any sense at all, it's *years* away from production. Their truck is nothing special compared to something like Rivian's or Tesla's, and both of those companies actually have working prototypes.

* It'll be interesting if ""Nikola World"" even has a Badger Truck to show off. (Also, the name completely sucks)

* He always sidesteps questions asked by interviews and twists the questions. She asked about them not producing a pickup truck, and then he says ""Well we have made a truck, we made the world's most advanced HFC truck..."" Yeah, not what she was talking about.

* Anheuser Busch has made FREE reservations of about 800 trucks, but they haven't committed any money to the project. Anyone can go reserve a truck for free. Reservations ARE NOT sales, and Trevor talks like they're sales. That's what got Enron in trouble in the 2000s with their ""Mark-to-market accounting"" tricks.

* In this interview, he mentions ""fun"" way too often. Not really sociopathic, just kind of weird. 

* They threatened to sue Bloomberg over the fact that their truck wasn't functional, which was true. If you haven't performed safety testing, then the truck isn't functional. People don't buy products without safety testing. That's why they're not actually following through on the lawsuit, because Trevor knows they would lose.

* He uses the same logic as Elizabeth Holmes, when she would spout that bullshit like ""First they say you're crazy, then they fight you and then all of a sudden, you change the world."" Worked out well for her, lmao!

* Why do they have such a big factory/warehouse space in Arizona, when their trucks are being ""hand built"" in Germany (wait, not Italy anymore??)? Also, hand-built means not an assembly line, right? He also continuously gets his dates messed up. In this interview he said they'd be beginning production within the next few months, [but in this article he says production won't begin until 2021](https://www.electrive.com/2020/02/07/nikola-tre-to-be-built-in-ulm-germany/). 

* Why is he taking shitty vertical cell-phone footage of trucks? Can't he have other employees do that?

* He talks about ""tickets to Nikola World"" like it's fucking Coachella or something. It's a company-sponsored event dude, no one gives a shit. Ooh, you get a $100 ticket if you put down a $1,000 deposit for a truck that's not going to be coming out for years?? What a deal!

* That factory in Ulm, Germany he keeps mentioning? Right now, they only produce [fire trucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iveco), they don't even manufacture semi-trucks. So, uh, they're just going to convert from building diesel powered fire trucks to building electric and/or HFC trucks? Has that ever been done before ever?

* [Trevor thinks that two days of reservations is enough to forecast an entire year's worth of reservations.](https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/i-ve-got-a-message-for-nikola-s-ceo-and-he-may-not-like-it-15365601)

* In that article, he takes all criticism as ""haters"" or whatever, and not people who just want to understand what's going on. That's cult-like behavior, something to avoid in droves if you ever see it as an investor. 

I could go on, that's what I've seen so far, and I'll probably keep updating this in the future. Result: I'd stay far away from this stock simply because they have nothing for sale for years, which is ridiculous. The CEO acts like a sociopath, and seems to embody the types of traits seen in other sociopaths who were engaging in fraudulent/vaporware products. They're just going to burn through any money that investors have added before delivering anything.

Edit: As mentioned in the comments, Trevor Milton isn't even the CEO any more. That job has been taken up by [Mark Russell](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2020/06/12/nikola-stock-surge-turns-ceo-mark-russell-into-hydrogen-truckmakers-second-billionaire/#2acd467c31d8) who was the former CEO of Worthington Industries, a metal manufacturing company.

134,"This rally is a mirage, we are only in the beginning stages of this recession",1586305614.0,"TL;DR at the bottom

Hi guys, with the market rallying 20% from its ""bottom"", many people are expressing the sentiment that we should buy back into the market again because the ""fed"" or the ""government"" won't allow stocks to crash. 

We will for sure see unprecedented actions taken by the fed and the government because they have both the motive and the political capital to enact such policies. However, I think this is a misguided reason to believe the market is currently making its ""real"" rally.

I am not not a permabear nor am I a permabull. I just try to objectively analyze the facts, apply a healthy dose of margin of safety, and then see if my conclusions are actionable.

For example, I posted my thesis on why we will enter a serious global economic downturn on Feb 9th 10 days before it happened. At the time we were at the height of the biggest bull market in our history, and I had gotten a lot of attacks on my thesis leading up to me consolidating my thoughts:

https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/f1fm6y/the_world_economy_will_enter_a_serious_downturn/

I continued adding more thoughts on things like the potential efficacy of Chloroquine 2 weeks before Trump announced it in a press conference and the media picked up on it, the potential collapse of American oil producers before the price war happened, casinos going under, helicopter money, bailouts, etc all before they were announced or the markets priced them in here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/fede69/continued_thoughts_on_the_global_economic_impact/

And finally I talked about an upcoming inflection point coincidentally moments before Trump first announced Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine and 2 trading days before the ""bottom"" of the market:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fleh7e/incoming_inflection_point_for_general_market/

So I'm perfectly happy to make bearish calls or bullish calls, they are dependent variables of independent and unbiased analysis. I hope I made a reasonable case for why I am not personally biased (although, for the sake of humanity, I do wish for progress and prosperity of course).

I think the market rally is largely a mirage, and we are not getting correct pricings. The rally is probably driven by two main sources:

- Capital displacement from monetary action

- Incorrect earnings modeling based on improper historic precedent.

So the capital displacement is relatively simple: If you're seeking shelter in ""risk free"" investments that has some yields, you're now competing with a buyer (federal reserve) that prints hundreds of billions up to whatever it wants. They're literally squeezing out capital from the finite treasuries.

If you want riskier high quality corporate bonds, the fed will be there.

If you want even equities, you're going to face competition for them in the future. At least that's what former chairwoman Jenet Yellen recently said about the possibility of expanding their powers to buy equities.

So money is getting squeezed into a smaller and smaller relative portion of the financial markets, and the artificial demand is driving yields down and prices up. I could write a whole thread about this, but let's stick with the explanation of price movement.

The second main reason for the recent rally is from institutional investors who are incorrectly modeling earnings/yield of equities. So the logic here is: trillions are injected into the economy (fiscal injections), those trillions will become earnings for companies at some multiplier of the original stimulus over x amount of time, and if we add this number to the unstimulated estimated earnings, we can model future earnings.

My issue with this model, is on two main assumptions:

The first assumption is the length of disruption caused by the threat of this virus.

This virus is not going to stop its serious disruption of behavior from economic actors. Especially not in a country like the US where the majority of people have a massive financial disincentive to seek out healthcare. Here's my logic:

For months I've been praising the governments and response of South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. With Taiwan being the absolute best at handling the virus. However, I have also been using them as my leading indicators for how the virus will progress and affect economic actors. What I have seen developing lately is not good.

Singapore is now calling for a shutdown, after they initially did a herculean job of containing their outbreak. I had hoped that they would develop procedures (that we can copy) needed to run an open economy while the threat of the virus looms in the background. But that is not what has happened. Instead, we are seeing growing numbers of new clusters forming, and quickly getting out of control. They are tightening and shutting down their economy rather than opening up more. This is our leading indicator. A government far more responsible and effective than us is resorting to shutting down. 

Taiwan is faring better, but only because of their prohibitive ban on almost all foreign travelers (this is obviously devastating to their tourism sector and broader economy). Their economy and society remains open, with many if not most people having hardly any interruptions to their lives (aside from mask wearing). They are one of only 3 countries where all children are still going to school. However, even their economy is faltering as they try to balance the prohibitive actions needed to contain the virus and the economic need to keep things open. They are proposing an unprecedented stimulus/rescue package to bolster their economy. And I think it's a safe assumption that if they ever do open up to foreign travelers again, especially with covid19 having proliferated as it already has, then they will have to deal with massive outbreak clusters all over their island.

South Korea, which has probably the relatable and relevant model for us to copy, has recently extended its social distance campaign. South Korea is a far larger nation than Singapore or Taiwan. They have a climate similar to Seattle/New York. They had a major outbreak in Deagu but didn't shut their country down. They never even banned Chinese travelers, yes, they had Chinese tourists in their country while the outbreak was happening. They were among the first to widely use Hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine as a treatment for Covid19. They had among the lowest fatality rates. They contained their outbreak without shutting the whole country down.

Even South Korea can't truly return to normal and open their economy up.

So why, in our incredible American exceptionalism hubris, and far less competent leaders, do we believe we're going to come anywhere close to normalcy in the near future?

Let's look at the next assumption, that fiscal stimulus would end up as earnings for companies. There's no doubt some will end up as earnings, but only a small fraction of what is being modeled by those on Wall Street.

The average American don't even have $1000 in emergency funds, do we expect them to return to their normal consumption habits when they risk having hospital bills multiples of $1000 just from walking past the wrong person? Do you think Americans, as much as they love to spend, aren't going to put some of that stimulus check in their emergency funds rather than contribute it to the earning of some companies? Sure, there will be some ""forced"" spending of the money (food and necessities), but if anyone is modeling the multiplier effect from previous data, then they really don't appreciate how different this virus makes things. Even in the GFC, laid off people didn't really worry about the heightened threat of being hospitalized.

Finally, some investors believe the Fed and the government literally will do anything to keep the numbers up. If this is true, you should be buying silver (or gold), not stocks.

Monetary actions can be reversed relatively easily. They are far more dynamic tools. Fiscal actions are not. You put money in the hands of spenders, that money is gonna circulate. And you really don't have an easy way of reversing that. If we think the government is going to keep handing out stimulus checks, grants to businesses, and other fiscal stimulus, then the inflation predicted from the GFC will come true for this crisis.

The fall out of inflation will be difficult to truly understand. But I do think inflation will be disruptive enough to the economy that inflation hedge assets will outperform other assets at least in the short term. For example, if inflation goes to 5%, who's going to lend to companies for less than inflation? With costlier debt, equity yield goes down, and again, what investor wants yields less than inflation? Inflation is going to cause all kinds of disruptions. I think the disruptions will come down to less liquidity (credit will vanish with uncertain inflation) and higher economic friction (less efficiency).

So if the response to why the market has to go up is continuous fiscal (and some monetary) actions to prop up spending and earnings, then the question is how will fiscal actions be reversed? How do we get that money out after things go back to ""normal""?

I think if we see equities rise from here, it'll be reflective of inflation rather than inflation-adjusted earnings. Silver would be the play here.

158,ELI5 the SoftBank call-option market manipulation,1599448864.0,"Here is an ELI5 (""explain like I'm 5 years old"") for the SoftBank news, very simplified, using toy numbers:

Imagine SoftBank buys a TSLA call option from Goldman Sachs for $1

That TSLA call option gives SoftBank the right to buy a TSLA share from Goldman for $500

Goldman Sachs wants to make sure he can easily sell a TSLA share to SoftBank for $500 even if the TSLA share price jumps up to $650 overnight

So Goldman Sachs buys a share of TSLA at the current market price (say, $475) to ""hedge"" the call option that he sold to SoftBank. Now that Goldman owns a $475 TSLA share, he can sell it to SoftBank for $500, no problem

In this way, SoftBank spends $1 to buy a call option and in doing so forces Goldman Sachs to buy a TSLA share for $475

The big news is that SoftBank spent more than $4 billion buying call options, and in doing so forced market makers to purchase **hundreds of billions of dollars of worth of shares**

This distorted the stock market. SoftBank's leveraged speculation produced, or amplified, a huge market bubble

It's like a Ponzi scheme, or a chain letter, or a stock pump/dump. It works by sucking money in. If you sell early (while the money is still flowing in), you win. If you sell too late, you lose

Generally speaking, 2019/2020's abnormal moves in TSLA (and other ""hot"" companies) seem to have little or no basis in business reality

Instead, they may be in large part caused by option (leveraged) speculation, which became popular among retail investors (e.g., r/wallstreetbets) in 2019 and which was taken to an extreme by SoftBank in 2020

Everybody hates ZeroHedge, but ZeroHedge broke this story before FT, WSJ, and CNBC. The ZeroHedge article appears to be accurate and has the details (SoftBank's 13-F disclosures, indicating which companies' shares were probably involved, etc.).

161,Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology,1608269722.0,"Stock market intraday patterns ‚Äì all times are in Eastern Standard Time!

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.

&#x200B;

9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!

&#x200B;

9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

&#x200B;

10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.

&#x200B;

11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‚Äòdrift‚Äô for the next hour or more. 

&#x200B;

11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

&#x200B;

1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.

&#x200B;

2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big ‚ÄúShake-out‚Äù points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.

&#x200B;

As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.

&#x200B;

3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It‚Äôs common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or ‚Äúcross‚Äù. 

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1.    Portfolio fit ‚Äì Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.

2.    Liquidity Check ‚Äì If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance ‚Äì look for ‚ÄúAverage Volume.‚Äù Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest ‚Äì this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.

3.    IV Percentile  ‚Äì Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it‚Äôs current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it‚Äôs current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it‚Äôs current volatility is low ‚Äì and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.

4.    Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.

5.    Strike Price ‚Äì First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity ‚Äì delta ‚Äì to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well ‚Äì higher intrinsic value.

&#x200B;

Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6.    Expiration ‚Äì Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock  meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta ‚Äì a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date ‚Äì your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7.    Position size ‚Äì This is important ‚Äì BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It‚Äôs much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8.    Future moves ‚Äì Think beyond what‚Äôs going on with a stock than just in the current day ‚Äì unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don‚Äôt rush your entry ‚Äì You want to ensure the best possibility of success. I‚Äôd take $500 profit with a 90% success rate over $750 profit with a 50% success rate any day. You want to build consistency, and plan your positions before you take them.

163,Everyone is a genius in a bull market: The Dunning-Kruger Effect.,1610838234.0,"The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with a low ability of a given task are prone to overestimate their ability at that task. We are incapable of objective evaluation of our own competency levels. I'm writing about it as I've come to realise I suffer from it.

Dunning and Kruger's main finding from their 1999 study ‚ÄúUnskilled and Unaware of it‚Äù was that the worst performers consistently overestimate their ability relative to others.

I've outlined two examples of this bias in action and how you can avoid some of these pitfalls:

1. Investing

As the age old saying goes, ""Everyone is a genius in a bull market.""

When your portfolio is growing and the markets are ripping as they have in 2020, many fall victim to the Dunning-Kruger Effect. We tend to wrongly attribute this performance to our ability as talented investors.

2. Politics

An obvious example people have been using recently is Donald Trump, whose confidence never wavers, despite his weak interest and understanding of policy matters.

The first rule of the Dunning-Kruger club is you don't know you're a member of the Dunning-Kruger club. But we're all human, and it's important to recognise that we are all prone to this cognitive bias.

Here are a few strategies to avoid it:

1. Identify your circle of competence

The circle of competence is a sacred place. It's a set of topics or areas that align with a person's expertise. Be ruthless in identifying and protecting the boundaries, and it's usually smaller than you think.

As Charlie Munger said, ""It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of being very intelligent.""

Know your competencies, focus on them. Know your incompetencies, avoid or outsource them.

2. Be a first principles thinker

A first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition - it is foundational in that it cannot be deduced from other assumptions. In chemistry, it's like an element. It cannot be broken down further.

Ground yourself in foundational truths and build up from there. Challenge your reasoning, and most importantly, always ask why.

""It isn't what you don't know that gets you in trouble. It's what you know for sure that just isn't so.""

To say that Microsoft‚Äôs latest acquisition is a coup for the gaming powerhouse is an understatement.

Titles from third-party developers often don‚Äôt make it to Game Pass until months after their initial release.

‚ÄúWith over 15 million subscribers currently on its Game Pass MSFT is doubling down on its consumer endeavors with this acquisition, a smart and strategic move in our opinion heading into its highly anticipated new console release,‚Äù Wedbush‚Äôs Dan Ives wrote in an analyst note following the announcement.

It‚Äôs important to note that Microsoft lost to Sony in the current console generation. It sold fewer units of its Xbox One than Sony sold of its PlayStation 4, roughly 50 million to 110 million, despite the prior generation‚Äôs Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 nearly matching each other in sales.

Dozens of swing trading books, technical analysis books, and day trading strategies. I've taken online courses through my local University in finance (working on an MBA). I do hours upon hours of research before investing in anything, yet everything I touch just gets destroyed. I bought Novagold this year. Next day, short report. Stock plummets. Luckin Coffee? Scandal, fraud, delisted twice, worthless stock. I bought BEN thinking it was a wise long call for dividend growth. Just keeps plummeting. When I bought Tesla and Netflix, they both sank. I've bought endless stocks when they've hit below the lower bollinger bands, and everytime I do, they just go lower (with no news mind you). I bought AAPL yesterday, thinking $386 was a good discount value purchase. PLUMMETING AGAIN. I just don't get it. When a company comes out with a great earnings report and I buy, the stock tanks. When a company comes out with bad earnings, it goes straight up after I short it. I could literally pull letters out of a hat and have better success.

Edit:  I should point out that I do day trade, and I wasn't actually referring to day trading, which I feel like is just a different game than investing.  Thanks to the PDT rule, I can only trade 3x per week, and every week all my profits are offset by my investments.

FINAL EDIT:  I'd just like to point out to save my sanity and refresh my outlook on life.

‚Ä¢ Current share value ($) / (equity/share)

3. Price to Earnings to Growth(PEG)

‚Ä¢ Good to use on a company with rapid growth

‚Ä¢ If PEG is less than or equal to 1 (1>x), company is undervalued.

‚Ä¢ If PEG is greater than or equal to 1 (1<x), the company might be overvalued.

4. Return of Equity (ROE)

‚Ä¢ ‚Äúhow well a company generates earnings‚Äù

‚Ä¢ 17-20% = very good

‚Ä¢ 20-25% = excellent

‚Ä¢ 25%+ = superior

5. Debt to Equity Ratio

‚Ä¢ Try to avoid companies that have a ratio greater than 2.

6. Current Ratio

‚Ä¢ ‚Äúthe ability to pay short term and long term debt‚Äù

‚Ä¢ x>1 = liability > assets

‚Ä¢ x<1 = liability < assets

‚Ä¢ x>3 = holding back

7. SEC Filings

‚Ä¢ File 4 = acquired/disposed of shares by insiders

‚Ä¢ File 8/10K, looking for management optimistic/bullish

Financials

1. IncomeStatement (Revenues & Expenses,P&L)

‚Ä¢ Revenue = driven by price and quantity of the product sold.

‚Ä¢ Costs of goods sold = price of labor, materials, etc.

‚Ä¢ General and Administrative Costs = price of sales people, utilities or rent).

‚Ä¢ that takes you down to operating profit or EBIT

‚Ä¢ from there you subtract out your interest expenses (amount of interest you pay for debt) and your taxes (companies have an effective tax rate) to get to your 'Net Income'

‚Ä¢ Financial institutions like to look at a metric called EBITDA (Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization) which is a semi proxy for free cash flow

‚Ä¢ its essentially your operating earnings adding back Depreciation and Amortization which are non cash expenses

‚Ä¢ Depreciation (think of buildings, you have a building worth $100 and you depreciate it over 5 years so goes down by $20 every year but its not a true expense so you add it back

‚Ä¢ Amortization is for intangibles think like Intellectual Property

2. BalanceSheet(Financial position at a given point in time)

‚Ä¢ Balance Sheet (financial position at point in time). Assets = Liabilities + Owner's Equity

‚Ä¢ That's the very definition

‚Ä¢ On the Assets side, you have Cash and equivalents (could be short-term treasuries that you can convert to cash pretty quickly usually within a year), Accounts Receivable (what a client owes you in credit), Inventory, PP&E (think like machinery for industrial companies). Liabilities is primarily A/P (what you owe ), Debt, both short and long term among others

‚Ä¢ then Owner's equity is Common Stock, Retained Earnings (Net Income - Dividends paid to date) flows from Net Income on income statement

3. Cash Flow Statement(cash flow from operations, financing and operations)

‚Ä¢ Cash Flow Statement, 3 main ones are Cash Flow from Operations (pretty straightforward what this means, day-to-day cash outflows/inflows)

‚Ä¢ Cash Flow from Investing (CapEX is the big one here, represents purchase and sale of equipment, plant, properties, etc.) also outflows from acquisitions or inflows from sales show up here ‚Ä¢ Cash Flow from Financing is how the company raises money, you issue stock, you issue debt, and you get money

‚Ä¢ companies can also repurchase their stock to lower number of shares outstanding, shows confidence in the stock

The market is often seen as a rational indicator of the current and future economy. President Trump often brags about his success as a proof of economic strength. But this idea that the market is an indicator of the future and is closely linked to the real economy is a myth in most cases. The market is usually very irrational, otherwise we would not collapse.

196,"Smoke alarms are ringing in the silver market, another generational bull market has begun - The ultimate silver DD. $PSLV $SILJ",1616567737.0,"I‚Äôve already posted DDs on silver in WallStreetBets a couple times, but I decided to come to r/StockMarket this time because WSB is completely focused on GME at the moment. 

Note this is not a post to tell you sell your GME. I‚Äôm personally still long GME.

In fact I hope I GME hits $1000 after earnings, I salute you fellow Apes.

&#x200B;

Silver however, is the market I have done the most research for, and why I am writing this DD. 

This post is quite long so here‚Äôs the **TLDR if you are lazy:** Buy PSLV and get ready to ride the silver rocketship. Alternatively, purchase 1000oz bars of silver at premiums under 5% to ride the rocket.

Quick Bullets:

* Silver will rise dramatically due to a fundamentals-based rally in industrial and monetary demand
* A short squeeze in silver is on the precipice of occurring, and could add gasoline to a bonfire, current short interest is 513%
* SLV is a scam, if you own it then sell and purchase PSLV (and the same goes for GLD, you can buy PHYS instead)
* The banks that run the silver market have been labeled ‚Äòcriminal enterprises‚Äô by the DOJ, for metals price manipulation, and these are the same banks entrusted with SLV/SIVR

&#x200B;

There are two types of bull markets in silver.  One is a fundamentals-based bull market, where silver is undervalued relative to industrial and monetary demand.  The second type of silver bull market is a short squeeze.  Both types of bull markets have occurred at different points in the past 60 years. However, the 1971-80 market in which the price of silver increased over 30x does was combination of both types of bull markets. 

**I believe we may be entering another silver bull market like the one that began in the fall of 1971, where both a short squeeze and fundamentals-based rally occur simultaneously.** 

So what are these ‚Äòsmoke alarms‚Äô I mentioned? 

I recently went digging through various data to try and quantify where we are in the silver bull/bear market cycle. 

I ended up creating an indicator that I like to call SMOEC, pronounced ‚Äòsmoke‚Äô.  

The components of the abbreviation come from the words Silver, Money supply, and Economy.

Lets look at the money supply relative to the economy, or GDP.  More specifically, if you look at the chart below, you will see the ratio of M3 Money supply to nominal GDP, monthly, from 1960 through 2020. 

https://preview.redd.it/5yh58ntwguo61.png?width=852&format=png&auto=webp&s=0da878286af614bfa216734371b1b9c257726612

When this ratio is rising, it means that the broad money supply (M3) is increasing faster than the economy, and when it is falling it means that the economy is growing faster than the money supply. 

One thing that is very important when investing in any asset class, is the valuation that you enter the market at.  Silver is no different, but being a commodity rather than cash-flow producing asset, how does one value silver? It might not produce cash flows or pay dividends, but it does have a long history of being used as both money and as a monetary hedge, so this is the correct lense through which to examine the ‚Äòvaluation‚Äô level of silver.  

Enter the SMOEC indicator. The SMOEC indicator tells you when silver is generationally undervalued and sets off a ‚Äòsmoke alarm‚Äô that is the signal to start buying.  In other words, SMOEC is a signal telling you when silver is about to smoke it up and get super high.  

Below, you will see a chart of the SMOEC indicator. SMOEC is calculated by dividing the monthly price of silver by the ratio shown above (M3/GDP). 

More specifically it is: LN(Silver Price / (M3/Nominal GDP))

Below you will see a chart of the SMOEC level from January 1965 through March 2021.

 

https://preview.redd.it/h6tfe4kvguo61.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=64a5e124ddf99608ab11470b0492fa9642553df2

I want to bring your attention to the blue long-term trendline for SMOEC, and how it can be used to help indicate when investing in silver is likely a good idea. Essentially, when growth in money supply is faster than growth of the economy, AND silver has been underinvested in as an asset class long enough, the SMOEC alarm is triggered as it hits this blue line.  

Since 1965, SMOEC has only touched this trendline three times.  

The first occurrence was in October 1971, where SMOEC bottomed at 0.79 and proceeded to increase 3.41 points over the next eight years to peak at 4.20 in February of 1980 (literally 420, I told you it was a sign silver was about to get high).  Silver rose from $1.31 to $36.13, or a 2,658% gain using the end of month values (the daily close trough to peak was even greater).  Over this same period, the S&P 500 returned only 67% with dividends reinvested.  Silver, a metal with no cash flows, outperformed equities by a multiple of 40x over this period of 8.5 years (neither return is adjusted for inflation).  This is partially due to the fact that the Hunt Brothers took delivery of so many contracts that it caused a short squeeze on top of the fundamentals-based rally.

The second time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was when SMOEC dropped to a ratio of 2.10 in November of 2001 and proceeded to increase 2.32 points over the next decade to peak at 4.42 in April of 2011.  Silver rose from $4.14 to $48.60, an increase of over 1000%, and this was during a ‚Äòlost decade‚Äô for equities.  The S&P 500 with dividends reinvested, returned only 41% in this 9.5-year period.  Silver outperformed equities by a multiple of 24x (neither figure adjusted for inflation).  There was no short squeeze involved in this bull market. 

Over the long term, it would be expected that cash flow producing assets would outperform silver, but over specific 8-10 year periods of time, silver can outperform other asset classes by many multiples.  And in a true hyperinflationary environment where currency collapse is occurring, silver drastically outperforms.  Just look at the Venezuelan stock market during their recent currency collapse.  Investors received gains in the millions of percentage points, but in real terms (inflation adjusted) they actually lost 94%. This is an example of a situation where silver would be a far better asset to own than equities.

I in no way think this is coming to the United States.  I do think inflation will rise, and the value of the dollar will fall, but it will be nothing even close to a currency collapse.  Fortunately for silver investors, a currency collapse isn‚Äôt necessary for silver to outperform equity returns by over 10x during the next decade. 

Back to SMOEC though:

The third time the SMOEC alarm was triggered was very recently in April of 2020 when it hit a level of 2.91.  Silver was priced at $14.96, at a time the money supply was and still is increasing at a historically high rate, combined with the previous decade‚Äôs massive underinvestment in Silver (coming off of the 2011 highs).  Starting in April 2020, silver has since risen to a SMOEC level of 3.37 as of March 2021.  Silver is 0.46 points into a rally that I think could mirror the 1970s and push silver‚Äôs SMOEC level up by over 3.4 points once again.  

&#x200B;

Remember that this indicator is on a LN scale, where each point is actually an exponential increase in the price of silver.  Here is a chart to help you mentally digest what the price of silver would be at various SMOEC level and M3/GDP combinations.  (LN scale because silver is nature‚Äôs money, so it just felt right)

The yellow highlighted box is where silver was in April of 2020 and the blue highlighted box is close to where it is as of March 2021.

**An increase of 3.4 points from the bottom in in April of 2020 would mean a silver price of over $500 an ounce before this decade is out.  And there‚Äôs really no reason it must stop there.**  

The recent money supply growth has been extreme, and as the US government continues to implement MMT related policies with massive debt driven deficits, it is expected that monetary expansion will continue.  This is why bonds and have been selling off recently, and why yields are soaring.  Long term treasuries just experienced their first bear market since 1980 (a drop of 20% or more).  The 40-year bull market bond streak just ended.  What was the situation like the last time bonds had a bear market? Massively higher inflation and precious metals prices.

This inflation expectation is showing up in surging breakeven inflation rates.  And this trend is showing very little sign of letting up, just look at the 5-year expected inflation rate:

 

https://preview.redd.it/dyp2056qhuo61.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=1aa926d50b73015ff6106b64c546d79c60369ec6

Inflation expectations are rising because we are actually starting to put money into the hands of real people rather than simply adding to bank reserves through QE. Stimulus checks, higher unemployment benefits, child tax credit expansion, PPP grants, deferral of loan payments, and likely some outright debt forgiveness soon as well. Whether or not you agree with these programs is irrelevant.  They are not funded by increased taxes, they are funded through debt and money creation financed by the fed.  As structural unemployment remains high (low unemployment is a fed mandate), I don‚Äôt see these programs letting up, and in fact I would be betting that further social safety net expansion is on the way. The $1.9 trillion bill was just passed, and it‚Äôs rumored the upcoming ‚Äòinfrastructure‚Äô bill is going to be between $3-4 trillion.

This is the trap that the fed finds itself in.  Inflation expectations are pushing yields higher, but the nation‚Äôs debt levels (public and private) have expanded so much that raising rates would crush the nation fiscally through higher interest payments. Raising rates would also likely increase unemployment in the short run, during a time that unemployment is already high.  So they won‚Äôt raise rates to stop inflation because the costs of doing so are more unpalatable than the inflation itself.  They will keep short term rates at 0%, and begin to implement yield curve control where they put a cap on long term yields (as was done in the 1940s, the only other time debt levels were this high).  So where does the air come out of this bubble, if the fed can‚Äôt raise rates at a time of expanding inflation?  The value of the dollar.  We will see a much lower dollar in terms of the goods it can buy, and likely in terms of other currencies as well (depending on how much money creation they perform). 

The other problem with the fed‚Äôs policy of keeping rates low for extended durations of time (like has been the case since 2008), is that it actually breeds higher structural unemployment.  In the short term, unemployment is impacted by interest rate shifts, but in the longer-term lower interest rates decrease the number of jobs available. Every company would like to fire as many people as possible to cut costs, and when they brag about creating jobs, know that the decision was never about jobs, but rather that jobs are a byproduct of expansion and are used as a bargaining chip to secure favorable tax credits and subsidies.  Recently, the best way to get rid of workers is through automation. 

Robotics and AI are advancing rapidly and can increasingly be used to completely replace workers. The debate every company has is whether its worth paying a worker $40k every year or buying a robot that costs $200k up front and $5k a year to do that job.  The reason they would buy the robot is because after so many years, there comes a point where the company will have saved money by doing so, because it is only paying $5k a year in up-keep versus $40k a year in salary and benefits. The cost of buying the robot is that it likely requires financing to pay that high of a price up front. In this situation, at 10% interest rates, the breakeven point for buying the robot versus employing a human is roughly 8 years.  At 2% interest rates though, the breakeven investment timeline for purchasing the robot is only 4 years. 

&#x200B;

The business environment is uncertain, and deciding to purchase a robot with the thought that it will pay off starting 8 years from now is much riskier than making a decision that will pay off starting only 4 years from now.  This trade off between employing people versus robots and AI is only becoming clearer too.  Inflation puts natural upward pressure on wages, governments are mandating higher minimum wages are costlier benefits as well.  There‚Äôs also the rising cost of healthcare that employers provide as well.  Meanwhile the costs of robotics and AI are plummeting.  The equation is tipped evermore towards capital versus labor, and the fed exacerbates this trend by ensuring the cost of capital is as low as possible via low interest rates. 

On top of the automation trend, low interest rates drive mergers and acquisitions which also drive higher structural unemployment. In an industry with 3 competitors, the trend for the last 40 years has been for one massive corporation to simply purchase its competitor and fire half the workers (you don‚Äôt need 2 accounting departments after all).  How can one $50 billion corporation afford to borrow $45 billion to purchase its massive competitor? Because long term low interest rates allow it to borrow the money in a way that the interest payments are affordable.  Lacking competitive pressures, the industry now stagnates in terms of innovation which hurts long term growth in both wages and employment. Of course, our absolutely spineless anti-trust enforcement is partially to blame for this issue as well. 

The fed is keeping interest rates low over long periods of time to help fix unemployment, when in reality low interest rates exacerbate unemployment and income inequality (execs get higher pay when they do layoffs and when they acquire competitors).  **The fed‚Äôs solution to the problem is contributing to making the problem larger, and they‚Äôll keep giving us more of the solution until the problem is fixed.**  And as structural unemployment continues, universal basic income and other social safety net policies will expand, funded by debt. Excess debt then further encourages the fed to keep interest rates low, because who wants to cut off benefits to people in need?  And then low long term interest rates create more unemployment and more need for the safety nets. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle, but one that is extremely positive for the price of precious metals, especially silver. 

And guess what expensive robotics, electric vehicles, satellites, rockets, medical imaging tech, solar panels, and a bevy of other fast-growing technologies utilize as an input?  Silver. Silver‚Äôs industrial demand is driven by the fact that compared to other elements it is the best conductor of electricity, its highly reflective, and it extremely durable.  So, encouraging more capital investment in these industries via green government mandates and via low interest rates only drives demand for silver further. 

One might wonder how with high unemployment we can actually get inflation. Well government is more than replacing lost income so far, just take a look at how disposable income has trended during this time of high unemployment. It‚Äôs also notable that all of the political momentum is in the direction of increasing incomes through government programs even further.

 

https://preview.redd.it/1lh1uc7shuo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e7173278d6cf25987cf42ca93fd64caeed499c2

The spark of inflation is what ignites rallies in precious metals like silver, and these rallies typically extend far beyond what the inflation rates would justify on their own. This is because precious metals are insurance against fiat collapse. People don‚Äôt worry about fiat insurance when inflation is low, but when inflation rises it becomes very relevant at a time that there isn‚Äôt much capacity to satisfy the surge in demand for this insurance. Sure, inflation might only peak at 5% or 10% and while silver rises 100%, but if things spiral out of control its worth paying for silver even after a big rally, because the equities you hold aren‚Äôt going to be worth much in real terms if the wheels truly came off the wagon.  The Venezuela example proves that fact, but even during the 1970s equities had negative real rates of return and the US never had hyperinflation, just high inflation. 

During these times of higher inflation, holders of PMs aren‚Äôt necessarily expecting a fiat collapse, they just want 1%, 5%, or even 10% of their portfolio to be allocated to holding gold and silver as a hedge. During the 40-year bond bull market of decreasing inflation this portfolio allocation to precious metals lost favor, and virtually no one has it any longer.  I can guarantee most people don‚Äôt even have the options of buying gold or silver in their 401ks, let alone actually owning any.  The move back into having even a small precious metals allocation it is what drives silver up by 30x or more. 

&#x200B;

Now it is time to dive deeper into the other contributor to the silver bull market, **the short squeeze.**  

There are plenty of banks talking about a commodities super cycle, and a ‚Äògreen‚Äô commodity super cycle where they upgrade metals like copper, but they never mention silver. Likely because banks have a massive net short position in silver. 

Lets dig into the silver squeeze, starting with the silver market itself. 

Silver is priced in the futures market, and its price is based on 1000oz commercial bars. A futures market allows buyers and sellers of a commodity to come to agreement on a price for a specific amount of that commodity at a specific date in the future. Most buyers in the futures market are speculators rather than entities who actually want to take delivery of the commodity.  So once their contract date nears, they close out their contracts and ‚Äòroll‚Äô them over to a future date.  Historically, only a tiny percentage of the longs take delivery, but the existence of this ability to take delivery is what gives these markets their legitimacy. If the right to take delivery didn‚Äôt exist, then the market wouldn‚Äôt be a true market for silver.  Delivery is what keeps the price anchored to reality. 

&#x200B;

Industrial players and large-scale investors who want to acquire large amounts of physical silver don‚Äôt typically do it through the futures market.  They instead use primary dealers who operate outside of the futures market, because taking delivery of futures is actually a massive pain in the ass.  They only do it if they really have to.  Deliveries only surge in the futures market when supply is so tight that silver from the primary dealers starts to be priced at a large premium to the futures price, thus incentivizing taking delivery.  Despite setting the index price for the entire silver market, the futures exchange is really more of a supplier of last resort than a main player in the physical market. 

Most shorts (the sellers) in the futures market also source their silver from sources outside of exchange warehouses for the occasional times they are called to deliver.  The COMEX has an inventory of ‚Äòregistered‚Äô silver that is effectively a big pile of silver that exists as a last resort source to meet delivery demand if supply ever gets very tight.  But even as deliveries are made each month, you will typically see next to no movement among the registered silver because silver is still available to source from primary dealers. 

So how have deliveries and registered ounces been trending recently? 

Let‚Äôs take a quick look at the first quarter deliveries in 2021 compared to the first quarter in previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/3o4eda0zhuo61.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=5212d0ec99fa8fadc3e87d7d97da0327f9bd9a06

After adding in the 3.6 million ounces of open interest remaining in the current March contract (anyone holding this late in the month is taking delivery), 1Q 2021 would reach 78 million ounces delivered.  This is a massive increase relative to previous years, and also an all-time record for Q1 from the data that I can find. 

Even more stark, is the chart showing deliveries on a 12-month trailing basis. 

Note: You have to view this on an annual basis because the futures market has 5 main delivery months and 7 less active months, so using a shorter time frame would involve cutting out an unequal share of the 5 primary months depending on what time of year it is. 

https://preview.redd.it/y0zbsru0iuo61.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5619336c219421bc93c10be859dd581814fdb7

As you can see from the chart, starting in the month of April 2020, deliveries have gone completely parabolic.  While silver doesn‚Äôt need deliveries to spike for a rally to occur, a spike in deliveries is the primary ingredient for a short squeeze.  The 2001-2011 rally didn‚Äôt involve a short squeeze for example, so it ‚Äòonly‚Äô caused silver to rise 10x.  In the 2020s however, we have a fundamentals-based rally that is running headlong into a surge in deliveries that is extremely close to triggering a short squeeze.  

In fact this is visible when looking at the chart of inventories at the COMEX. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0wd4lwgqkuo61.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bf26d8204bc0817457ebe56a6354ba7ede4ad8e

As you can see from the graph and the chart above, COMEX inventories are beginning to decline at a rapid pace. To explain a bit further, the ‚Äòeligible‚Äô category of COMEX is silver that has moved from registered status to delivered.  It is called ‚Äòeligible‚Äô because even though the ownership of the silver has transferred to the entity who requested delivery, they haven‚Äôt taken it out of the warehouse.  It is technically eligible become ‚Äòregistered‚Äô if the owner decided to sell it. However, the fact that it is in the eligible category means that it would likely require higher silver prices for the owner to decide to sell. 

The current path of silver in the futures market is that registered ounces are being delivered, they then become eligible, and entities are actually taking their eligible stocks out of COMEX warehouses and into the real physical world. This is a sign that the futures market is currently the silver supplier of last resort.  And there are only 127 million ounces left in the registered category. 1/3 of an ounce, or roughly $10 worth of silver is left in the supply of last resort for every American.  If just 1% of Americans purchased $1,000 worth of the PSLV ETF, it would be equivalent to 127 million ounces of silver, the entire registered inventory of the COMEX.  That‚Äôs how tight this market is. 

Right now we are sending most Americans a $1,400 check.  If 1% of them converted it to silver through PSLV, this market could truly explode higher. 

And lest you think this surge in deliveries is going to stop any time soon, just take a look at how the April contract‚Äôs open interest is trending at a record high level:

https://preview.redd.it/knr5kwz7iuo61.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=c07edc45ea6d245cb58ff972cc93b847861d6c6e

It looks almost unreal.  And keep in mind the other high points in this chart were records unto themselves.  That light brown line was February 2021, and look how its deliveries compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/pf93niaaiuo61.png?width=480&format=png&auto=webp&s=4835e10de33e28790f7c588858c883df25f44949

12 million ounces were delivered in the month of February 2021. A month that is not a primary delivery month, and which exceeded previous year‚Äôs February totals by a multiple of 4x.  Open interest for February peaked at 8 million ounces, which means that an additional 4 million ounces were opened and delivered within the delivery window itself.  

April‚Äôs open interest is currently at a level of 15 million ounces and rising. If it followed a similar pattern to February of intra-month deliveries being added, it could potentially see deliveries of over 20 million ounces.  20 million ounces in a non-active month would be completely unheard of and is more than most primary delivery months used to see.   

Here‚Äôs what 20 million ounces delivered in April would look like compared to previous years:

https://preview.redd.it/9qehkardiuo61.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=eeeaccab17039c03f9b8214dabfce7dea377ea18

So just how tenuous is the situation that the shorts have put themselves in (yes CFTC, the shorts did this to themselves)?  Well let‚Äôs look at the next active delivery month of May:

 

https://preview.redd.it/1lgflbrhiuo61.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=a84d4fe485a9a5a0cafeb7e6d8a40f99a88049a0

https://preview.redd.it/j3u861k0juo61.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=eee4cc550f8b790a913f7ce073ae9afe8e6f5230

If a larger percentage than usual take delivery in May, there is easily enough open interest to cause a true run on silver. With 127 million ounces in the registered category, and 652 million ounces in the money, most of it from futures rather than options, the short interest as a % of the float is roughly 513%.  Its simply a matter of whether the longs decide to call the bluff of the shorts.  

No long contract holder wants to be left holding the last contract when the COMEX declares ‚Äòforce majeure‚Äô and defaults on its delivery obligations.  This means that they will be settled in cash rather than silver, and won‚Äôt get to participate in the further upside of the move right when its likely going parabolic.  As registered inventories dwindle, longs are incentivized to take physical delivery just so that they can guarantee they will be able to remain long silver.  

Of course, the COMEX could always prevent a default by simply allowing silver to continue trading higher. There is always silver available if the price is high enough.  Like the situation with GameStop, the authorities have historically tended to interfere with the silver market during previous short squeezes where longs begin to take delivery in large quantities.  

There were always shares of GME available to purchase, it‚Äôs just that the price had not reached what the longs were demanding quite yet. Given that it was the powerful connected elite of society who were short GME though, the trade was shut down and rigged against the millions of retail traders.  The GME short squeeze may indeed return, because in this situation it‚Äôs millions of small individuals holding GME. While they were able to temporarily prevent purchases of GME, they can‚Äôt force them to sell. 

In the silver short squeeze of the 1970s, that‚Äôs exactly what the authorities forced the Hunt Brothers (the duo that orchestrated the squeeze) to do, [they forced them to sell](https://www.businessinsider.com/hunt-brothers-trying-to-corner-silver-market-2016-5).  The difference this time is that it‚Äôs not a squeeze orchestrated by a single entity, but rather millions of individuals who are purchasing silver.  There is no collusion on the long side among a small group of actors like in the 70s with the Hunt brothers or when Warren Buffet squeezed silver in the late 90s, so there‚Äôs no basis to stop the squeeze.  

The regulators literally pulled a ‚ÄòGameStop‚Äô on the silver market.  Or in reality, the more recent action with GameStop was regulators pulling a ‚Äòsilver‚Äô.  The regulators will try everything in their power to prevent the squeeze from happening again, but this time it‚Äôs not two brothers and a couple of Saudi princes buying millions of ounces each (or just Warren Buffet on his own), but rather it‚Äôs millions of retail investors buying a few ounces each.  There is no cornering the market going on.  This is actual silver demand running headlong into a silver market that banks have irresponsibly shorted to such a level that they deserve the losses that hit them.  They‚Äôve been manipulating and toying with silver investors for decades and profiting off of illegal collusion.  Bailing out the banks as their losses pile up would be truly reprehensible action by our government, and tacit admission that our government is ok with a few big banks on the short side stealing billions from small individual investors. 

So what are these games of manipulation that the banks have played? 

**The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.** ‚Äì Unless their bluff is truly called, and short squeeze occurs. Which means that the paper supply (contract silver that exists in the form of short futures contracts) has to be bought back at far higher prices to prevent further margin calls and possible insolvency. 

When the silver squeeze began in late January, there was a flurry of media interviews and articles by experts who claimed that a retail driven short squeeze just isn‚Äôt possible.  Why were they so confident? Because the banks have owned this game since futures began trading, and retail buyers don‚Äôt purchase 1000oz bars, they tend to purchase 1oz coins.

These small unit coins and bars are produced by mints both public and private.  These mints take 1000oz bars and use them to produce smaller silver bars and coins, but there is a limit to their production capacity. In normal times a mint might produce 5 million ounces a year, and in a time like today when demand is surging maybe they run the machines 24 hours a day and pump that production up to 10 million ounces in a year.  Does this add to demand for 1000oz bars? Yes, but the amount that it can add is capped at the production capacity of the mints.  Beyond the amount production can be ramped up, demand simply pushes premiums for these small units of silver higher, rather than the price of silver itself.  The large banks who are short 1000oz bars know that demand from this channel is capped, and thus they feel perfectly safe remaining in, or even increasing their short positions when retail coin and bar demand surges. 

Once small unit silver premiums soar, the next place retail investors start to place money is in silver ETFs, primarily the SLV ETF.  This is where the real fucking over of retail silver investors starts. 

Jeff Currie from Goldman had an interview on February 4th where he dismissed the idea of a silver short squeeze, and he had one line that was especially profound,

‚ÄúIn terms of thinking how are you going to create a squeeze, the shorts are the ETFs, the ETFs buy the physical, they turn around and sell on the COMEX.‚Äù ‚Äì Jeff Currie of Goldman

This was shocking to holders of SLV, because SLV is a long-only silver ETF. They simply buy silver as inflows occur and keep that silver in a vault.  They have no price risk, if the price of silver declines, it‚Äôs the investors who lose money, not the ETF itself so there is no need to hedge by shorting on the COMEX.  Further, their prospectus prohibits them from participating in the futures market at all.  So how is the ETF shorting silver?

They aren‚Äôt.  The iShares SLV ETF is not shorting silver, its custodian, JP Morgan is shorting silver. This is what Jeff Currie meant when he said the shorts are the ETFs.  Moreover, he said it with a tone like this fact should be plainly obvious to all of the dumb retail investors.  He truly meant what he said. 

What is a custodian you ask? The custodian of the ETF is the entity that actually buys, sells, and stores the silver. All iShares does is market the ETF and collect the fees. When money comes in they notify their custodian and their custodian sends them an updated list of silver bars that are allocated to the ETF. 

But no real open market purchases of silver are occurring.  Instead, JPM (and a few sub custodian banks) accumulated a large amount of silver, segmented it off into LBMA vaults, and simply trade back and forth with the ETFs as they receive inflows.  **Thus, ensuring that ETF inflows never actually impact the true open market trade of silver.**  When the SLV receives inflows, JPM sells silver from the segmented off vaults, and then proceeds to short silver on the futures exchange.  As the price drops, silver investors become disheartened and sell their SLV, thus selling the silver back to JPM at a lower price.  It‚Äôs a continuous scalp trade that nets JPM and the banks billions in profits.  Here‚Äôs a diagram to help you sort it out: 

 

[Reduce, reuse, recycle](https://preview.redd.it/b8patrd4juo61.png?width=864&format=png&auto=webp&s=733303b57df19c5133ea50432dc6068640b543a0)

An even more clear admission that SLV doesn‚Äôt impact the real silver market came on February 3rd when it changed its prospectus to state that it might not be possible to acquire additional silver in the near future.  What does this even mean?  Why would it not be possible to acquire additional silver? As long as the ETF is willing to pay a higher price, more silver will be available to purchase. But if the ETF doesn‚Äôt participate in the real silver market, that‚Äôs actually not the case.  What SLV was admitting here, was that the silver in the JPM segmented off vaults might run out, and that they refuse to bid up the price of silver in the open market.  They will not purchase silver to accumulate additional inflows, beyond what JPM will allow them to. 

&#x200B;

If you are purchasing SLV thinking you are purchasing silver on the open market, you could not be more wrong.  **Purchasing SLV is the best way for a silver investor to shoot themselves directly in the face.** 

The real issue here is that purchasing SLV doesn‚Äôt actually impact the market price of silver one bit. The price is determined completely separately on the futures exchange.  SLV doesn‚Äôt purchase futures contracts and then take delivery of silver, it just uses JPM as a custodian who allocates more silver to their vault from an existing, controlled supply. This is an extremely strange phenomenon in markets, and its unnatural. 

For example, when millions of people buy Tesla stock, it puts a direct bid under the price of the stock, causing the price to rise. 

When millions of people put money into the USO oil ETF, that fund then purchases oil futures contracts directly, which puts a bid under the price of oil.

But when millions of people buy SLV, it does nothing at all to directly impact the price of silver. The price of silver is determined separately, and SLV is completely in the position of price taker. 

So how do we know banks like JPM are shorting on the futures market whenever SLV experiences inflows?  Well luckily for us the CFTC publishes the ‚Äòbank participation report‚Äô which shows exactly how banks are positioned on the futures market.

The chart below shows SLV YoY change in shares outstanding which are evidence of inflows and outflows to the ETF.  The orange line is the net short position of all banks participating in the silver futures market.  The series runs from April-2007 through February-2021.  I use a 12M trailing avg of the banks‚Äô net position to smooth out the awkward lumpiness caused by the fact that futures have 5 primary delivery months per year, and this causes cyclicality in the level of open interest depending on time of year.

 

https://preview.redd.it/vydektr6juo61.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=a68f0678d992f1c30c33a84436034dbabe133f8d

It is evident that as SLV experiences inflows, banks add to short positions on the COMEX, and as SLV experiences outflows they reduce these short positions.  What‚Äôs also evident is that the short interest of the banks has grown over time, which is also why silver is ripe for a potential short squeeze. 

One other thing that is evident, is that the trend of banks shorting when SLV receives inflows, is starting to break down. Specifically, beginning in the summer of 2020, as deliveries began to surge, the net short interest among banks has actually declined as SLV has experienced inflows. It‚Äôs likely one or more banks see the risk, and the writing on the wall and is trying to exit before the squeeze happens. 

For further evidence of this theme of, ‚ÄúIf banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall‚Äù look no further than the deliveries data itself,

https://preview.redd.it/r9jxmp28juo61.png?width=869&format=png&auto=webp&s=62bfcaa15c404d6e9be8425ea739265c17282b82

You‚Äôll notice that as long as investors didn‚Äôt actually want the silver to be delivered, the price of silver was allowed to rise, but whenever deliveries showed and uptick, the price would begin to fall once again.  This is because the shorts know that they can decrease the price of all silver in the world by shorting on the COMEX, and then secure real physical silver from primary dealers to actually make delivery.  Why pay a higher price to the dealers when you can simply add to shorts on the COMEX and push the price down, and then acquire the silver you need? 

But just like the graph of the bank net short position, you‚Äôll notice that this relationship started to break down in 2020, and the price has started to rise alongside deliveries.  **The short squeeze is underway, and the dam is about to break.**  

And lest you think I‚Äôm reaching with my accusations of price manipulation by JPM, why not just listen to what the department of Justice concluded?

For JPM and the banks involved in the silver market, fines from regulators are just a cost of doing business. The only way to get banks to stop manipulating precious metals markets is to call the bluff, take delivery, and make them feel the losses of their short position.  Silver is the best candidate for this to occur. 

SLV is by far the largest silver ETF in the world, with 600 million ounces of silver under its control, and its custodian was labeled a criminal enterprise for manipulation of silver markets.  Why should silver investors ever put their money into a silver ETF where the entity that controls the silver is actively working against them, or at a minimum is a criminal enterprise?

And let me know if you see a trend in the custodial vaults of the other popular silver ETFs:

Further exacerbating the lack of trust one should have in these ETFs, is the fact that they store the metal at the LBMA in London. Unlike the COMEX that has regular independent audits, the LBMA isn‚Äôt required to have independent audits, nor do independent audits occur.  I‚Äôm not saying the silver isn‚Äôt there, but why not allow independent auditors in to provide more confidence? 

So what are investors to do in a rigged game like this?  

Well, there is currently one ETF that is outside this system, and which actually purchases silver on the open market as it receives inflows. That ETF is PSLV, from Sprott. Founded by Eric Sprott, a billionaire precious metals investor with a stake in nearly ever silver mine in the world, so you know his interests are aligned with the longs of the PSLV ETF (in desiring higher prices for silver via real price discovery).  Further, Sprott buys its silver directly, it doesn‚Äôt have a separate entity doing the purchasing, it stores its silver at the Royal Canadian Mint rather than the LBMA, and it is independently audited. By purchasing the PSLV ETF, retail investors can actually acquire 1000oz bars and put a bid under the price of silver in the primary dealer marketplace.  And if a premium occurs among primary dealers, deliveries will occur in the futures market.  This is what is starting to happen right now.  And this is happening after PSLV has added just 30 million ounces over 7 weeks.  Imagine what will happen if investors create 100 million ounces of demand.  

Even a small portion of SLV investors switching to PSLV because they realize the custodian of SLV is a criminal enterprise, would create a massive groundswell of demand in the real physical silver market.  

I‚Äôd highly recommend at least some allocation to physical silver through PSLV, and actual physical bars and coins (when premiums come down to earth) as soon as possible. If you are a large player and can take delivery on the COMEX that is easily the cheapest and best route to get exposure as well. 

**Alternate plays with more risk and potential reward include silver miners, silver miner ETFs, and call options on these silver stocks.** 

**Whatever you do, don‚Äôt buy any silver ETFs that aren‚Äôt PSLV.** 

Silver is about to ride a rocket to the moon, the banks will get what they deserve, screw the suits, retail investors deserve to win for once, whether its silver or GME.  It‚Äôs time the banks played by the rules of the system like the rest of us.

197,How to be Wrong and Still Make Money: A comprehensive guide to selling credit spreads,1600314417.0,"So I first dipped my toes into options trading a few years ago. I had previously been swing trading stocks so I had a couple years of experience before that, but the leverage and potential returns that options provided really piqued my interest. After it was all said and done, I lost almost $20,000 buying options. After realizing that someone was getting all of this money I was losing, I learned about option selling and haven‚Äôt looked back since.

I recently posted my YTD performance [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/i0mkv3/10k_to_100k_in_5_months_23k_in_deposits_and_67k/), and received a lot of questions about how I did it. My strategy changed over time, but I first started with credit spreads, which may be applicable to more people since it‚Äôs a strategy that works with smaller accounts too. I got a lot of questions about how I played credit spreads and it‚Äôs tough to completely explain what I do through a comment here and a comment there so I created this guide explaining my exact approach to trading credit spreads. Here you go:

This is a wall of text, so if you're a more visual learner, here's a link to videos explaining all four parts:

[Part One](https://youtu.be/J12HR1Ax2k0)

[Part Two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1mlknat5qA)

[Part Three](https://youtu.be/Uu7_8856nZw)

[Part Four](https://youtu.be/2p5nlczCcFo)

#Part One: The Basics

So what is a spread? A high level conceptual explanation is that you‚Äôre essentially betting on a stock to finish above or below a certain price upon expiration. One of the advantages here is that you can set this number out of the money, so if a stock is trading at $100, you can bet that it‚Äôll remain below $110 by a certain date. This is a bearish position, so if you‚Äôre correct and it goes down, you‚Äôll make max profit. The catch though is that even if you‚Äôre wrong, you basically have a 10% upward cushion before you start to lose any money. So the easiest way to describe it is a strategy that lets you make money if you‚Äôre right, but also make money if you‚Äôre slightly off.

How does it work? So in the above example, if we were bearish on a stock we would open what‚Äôs called a call credit spread. We could set it up where we sell a 110c for a credit of $1.50, and buy a 115c for a debit of $0.50. This means that in this transaction we receive $1.50, and pay $0.50 for a net credit of $1. That credit is your max profit on the play. If you‚Äôre familiar with options you‚Äôll know that if the stock finishes at or below $110 upon expiration, both of these calls will be worthless. That‚Äôs great news for us because the long leg we bought (115c) for 0.50 will be a loss, but we‚Äôll get to keep the full $1.50 from the short leg (110c) that we sold, resulting in us realizing our max gain on the trade of $1.

Why not just sell the 110c and collect the full $1.50? While it cuts into our profits, the reason we buy the 115c in this example for $0.50 isn‚Äôt to cut into our profits when we‚Äôre correct, but rather protect us when we‚Äôre wrong. If the stock in the example stays below $110, we‚Äôre good to go and we‚Äôll hit max profit. But what if it goes to $120, $150, or something crazy happens and it hits $200. If the stock hits $150 upon expiration, that 110c that we sold for $1.50 will be worth $40, meaning that we‚Äôll incur a $3,875 loss in pursuit of a $150 gain. We‚Äôve seen crazy run ups from the likes of TSLA and ZM lately, and people who sold what we call ‚Äúnaked options‚Äù got absolutely killed. With our spread, yes our 110c will be worth $40 meaning we‚Äôre down $4,000 on that position, but the 115c we bought behind it will be worth $35 meaning we‚Äôre up $3,500 there for a net loss of $500. Additionally, we get to keep that $1.00 credit we received up front no matter what, so our loss with this spread is actually $500-$100=$400 as opposed to the $3,875 loss that we would‚Äôve seen had we sold the 110c by itself. THAT is the value in selling a spread as opposed to a naked option.

Why are you multiplying everything by 100? Each options contract is worth 100 shares, so a contract that is trading for $1.50 actually costs $150 to purchase.

Another high level point I like to make is that there are really 5 different things that can happen when you make a play. Let‚Äôs say you think a stock will go up. It can (1) go up a ton and you‚Äôd be correct, (2) go up a little and you‚Äôd be correct, (3) trade flat and you‚Äôd be incorrect, (4), go down a little and you‚Äôd be incorrect, or (5) go down a lot and you‚Äôd be incorrect. With a bullish spread, you‚Äôd hit max profit on 4/5 , or 80% of the possible outcomes, whereas if you bought stock or purchased an option you‚Äôd only be profitable on (1) or (2). Obviously the actual outcomes are a little more complex, but for a base-level understanding of the advantages a spread provides, I think this is a good way to look at it.

So that‚Äôs the value of a spread. A lot of traders are introduced to option selling and are scared of the prospect of incurring a huge loss like we mentioned above, but using credit spreads is a great way of receiving the benefits that selling has to offer while limiting a lot of the risks. So let‚Äôs move onto actually opening a spread.


#Part Two: Making the Trade
So for actually opening a spread up, we have a four-step approach we take: Pick a Stock Pick a Direction Pick a Strike Price Execute the Trade

**1: Picking a Stock:**

One of the most important things I tell people is to trade what you know. I have a watchlist of 25-30 stocks that I watch and get familiar with during the day. That way if I recognize a good opportunity, I‚Äôll have a decent base of knowledge to rely on to make what I feel is a smart play. It‚Äôs super easy to get caught up in the ‚Äústock of the week‚Äù and try to jump in on a play because a ticker is in the news. If you‚Äôre not familiar with a stock, don‚Äôt trade it.

For this example (the one used in the video), Wayfair was trading in a 195-210 range for a little bit and then had a big day where it broke up out of that range and up towards $220. This was an unusual move that I noticed since it was on my watchlist, so I decided to make a play.

STOCK: WAYFAIR

**2: Picking a direction:**

So if we look at Wayfair‚Äôs YTD chart, it has exploded this year. A clear upward trend, but a recent trend that I noticed from following the stock was that every time it broke out like this, there would be a little bit of a pullback afterwards. Additionally, I felt the stock was overvalued on a fundamental basis (had a negative book value at the time of the trade) so I wanted to play this stock back down. This is probably the quickest and easiest step of the four, since you‚Äôll likely already have an opinion on most of the stocks that you follow.

DIRECTION: DOWN

**3:Picking a Strike Price:**

So we know that we‚Äôre going to be playing Wayfair back down, but now the question is what spread are we going to set up to do that. In this example Wayfair was trading at $218.42 at the time that we decided to make this trade. In the video we illustrate a trading channel that Wayfair was at the top of. It was also approaching the ATH of $221.54. A lot of the time that will act as resistance for a stock, meaning it‚Äôll bounce down off of it. So in order to give ourselves a bit of a cushion we decided to set our short leg at 222.50, meaning that we‚Äôre playing the stock to stay below $222.50 by the end of that week.

So with this play it means in plain English that if we‚Äôre correct and the stock goes down, we hit max profit. But if we‚Äôre wrong and it goes up, we still have a $4.08 cushion before we‚Äôre not hitting max profit anymore. So we could be a little wrong, have the stock go up a few dollars, and still walk away with max profit.

STRIKE PRICE OF SHORT LEG: $222.50

**4: Executing the Trade:**

I‚Äôll be the first to tell you that when I started trading spreads I didn‚Äôt realize you could open both legs of the spread at once. I was stupid. I would like to think I‚Äôm at least a little bit smarter now. If you look at the options screen for most brokers, you‚Äôll just see single legs. Switching over to ‚Äúvertical‚Äù allows you to set up the entire spread in one trade. If you use something like RH, there‚Äôs a feature that allows you to select multiple options, so you‚Äôll select the one you wish to sell (short leg) and the one you wish to buy (long leg).

In this example we selected the 222.5/227.5c spread, meaning that we sold the short leg of 222.5 and the long leg of 227.5. The net credit was 1.45, which is our max gain on the trade. A wider spread gives a larger credit but also increases max loss. This is a $5 wide spread but we could have made it a tighter spread with a $2.5 width. Typically the best risk to reward ratio is on the tightest spreads, but a slightly wider spread will raise your breakeven price and studies have shown that it actually results in better expected value long term.

Circling back to the credit we received of $1.45, this means that our max profit was $145 and our max loss was $355 for each spread that we sold. We know that because our broker tells us that, but a quick way to calculate it is the width of the spread minus the credit. A $1.45 credit on $5 wide spread means a $5-$1.45=$3.55 max loss.

When I evaluate trades like this I look for a max profit to max loss ratio of 1:2 to 1:4. Based on different scanners I‚Äôve seen, the best expected values tend to fall on spreads within that risk/reward ratio. The ratio on this trade is 1:2.44.

So we put our order in for a credit of $1.45, it filled, and now we get to sit back and watch. Sometimes your order won‚Äôt fill right away. In fact, most of the time it won‚Äôt fill right away. It‚Äôs important to be patient with your fill price and not chase it downwards. We want the highest credit possible. So if the credit on these spreads dropped to 1.30 when I was trying to place an order, it usually isn‚Äôt a great idea to drop my order price down to 1.30 just to get a fill. The only time I would recommend that is if you‚Äôre trying to open a spread right before the market closes. Otherwise, hang tight. Patience pays.

#Part 3: Managing the Trade

So now that we‚Äôve made the trade, it‚Äôs time to manage it. In my opinion one of the best parts about trading spreads is that they don‚Äôt require active management. You get to sit back and watch the price. Once the trade has been opened, which is also quick, it takes very little effort.

So with the Wayfair example we used, our analysis turned out perfectly, as Wayfair touched the ATH and dipped back down to end the week safely at $214. We hit max profit on that trade, but what if the trade goes against us? That‚Äôs what we‚Äôll take a look at in this section.

One thing we didn‚Äôt address in part two is when to open the trade. We like opening spreads on Mondays and Tuesdays, and monitoring them during the week. This is the part of my strategy that is a little bit controversial, as there is a (legitimate) school of thought that selling spreads about 45 DTE is better value. I like that idea and if you would rather do that then absolutely go for it. It‚Äôs important to trade what you‚Äôre comfortable with. All of the lessons in here still apply to that strategy. With that said though, I stick with the weekly strategy of opening them at the beginning of the week and look to close them throughout the week.

The way I see it, your % of max profit should be the metric you‚Äôre looking at when deciding what to do with a spread. Divided up equally, that means if you progressed through the week to max profit in a linear fashion, you would be at 20% of max profit on Monday, 40% on Tuesday, and so forth. A good rule of thumb I use is that if you‚Äôre ever on the fence about whether or not to close something out, do so if your return exceeds the linear return for that day of the week. The market can move quickly and I‚Äôve had several times where I have regretted not closing a spread out. It‚Äôs important to take profit.

Another thing I‚Äôll add to this is that this weekly strategy gets a little risky on Thursday afternoon headed into Friday. If your spread is remotely close to being in the money on Thursday afternoon, close it out. Now that I type that out I realize that may all sound a little convoluted, but it‚Äôs better visualized in the video I‚Äôve linked for this section.

Now let's get into what happens if a trade really starts to move against you. With the strategy we use there are really two options: (1) Close the trade for a loss and move on, or (2) Roll the strikes higher.

The first option is pretty self explanatory, but a quick note I want to add here is that you can have a stock move way against you but still be able to close the trade for less than max loss. The example I use in my video is I played FB earnings, thought it would go down, but it shot way above my spread and well into max loss territory. We opened a 245/247.5c spread for a credit of $0.54. FB was reporting earnings on a Thursday night and we sold this spread that expired the following day, so there wasn‚Äôt a ton of time to manage it. Long story short, FB killed earnings and shot up to $256 that morning. Really not a prayer that it would come back down to the spread I opened by the end of the day. But despite the fact that this trade went way against us and we had almost no time to manage it since it was a Friday play, we were still able to close out for a debit of $1.90. Yes that‚Äôs a loss of $1.36 per spread, but we SAVED an additional $0.60 cent loss by avoiding a max loss debit of $2.50. That‚Äôs another benefit of spreads.

Let‚Äôs talk about option two. This is the best option to use if you‚Äôre confident that you‚Äôre correct about the ultimate price action on a stock, but you need a little extra wiggle room on the trade. For this example we‚Äôll look at a TSLA call spread that I opened. TSLA was trading at $1542 after an incredible run, so I figured I would play it below 1600 with a 1600/1610c spread that offered a credit of $2.52. As is the theme with this section, TSLA exploded the following morning (Tuesday) and went all the way up to $1794 at one point. My spread was literally almost $200 out of the money. One of the biggest possible moves against myself that I had ever seen. Despite this crazy move, it was only Tuesday and we were able to close the first spread for a debit of only $5.25 (as opposed to a $10 max debit). We opened 6 of these off the bat so this was a loss of $1638. From there we ‚Äúrolled‚Äù our strikes higher, opening 10 1750/1760c spreads for a credit of $3.45. So the closing and subsequent opening of a spread like we did here is what we are referring to when we say we ‚Äúrolled the strikes higher‚Äù.

By the end of the week TSLA had finally crashed a bit and it finished at $1506. This meant the second of spreads we opened were easily max profit. And while we lost $1,638 on the first set of spreads we opened here, we profited $3,450 on the second set of spreads so we were able to still finish the week with a $1,812 profit on TSLA. The funny thing with this one is that the original spread would have hit max profit since it dropped all the way back down to 1500, but we would have had the same result had TSLA finished anywhere below 1750.

Rolling the strikes higher gave me extra breathing room and turned a potential disaster into a profitable trade. One thing I‚Äôll add though is that with this method you do run the risk of increasing your potential max loss. Because of that, I‚Äôll only roll my strikes higher ONCE. Anything past that is chasing a losing trade. If I roll my strikes higher and it‚Äôs still going against me, I‚Äôm at the point where I need to accept the fact that I don‚Äôt fundamentally understand a stock as well as I thought I did and move on. There is always another trade out there.

The final point I‚Äôll add to this is ALWAYS CLOSE OUT YOUR SPREADS. The only time I‚Äôll let a spread expire worthless is if my spread is OTM by a crazy amount and it would quite literally take a historic after-hours move on Friday to take me back ITM. Other than that, close your spreads out. Even if it‚Äôs just for a $0.05 debit. It may seem annoying but I‚Äôll tell you why in the following section.

#Part 4: Additional Risks and Considerations

I will start this section by saying I‚Äôve never been impacted by any of the following risks, but it‚Äôs important to be aware of 100% of the possible outcomes of your trade before you enter it. They‚Äôre infrequent but this really wouldn‚Äôt be a comprehensive guide if I omitted them. They are as follows: (1) Early Assignment, (2) Dividend Risk, (3) Pin Risk.

**1: Early Assignment:**

The best way to start this section is by talking about why your max loss is actually your max loss. We know it‚Äôs quickly calculated as the width of your spread minus the credit, but why is that?

Let‚Äôs use a 110/115c spread as an example. We‚Äôll say we received a credit of $1. We know that if the stock finishes anywhere below 110 then both legs are worthless and we‚Äôll hold onto that $1 credit. But what happens if we‚Äôre in a max loss position. Let‚Äôs say the stock finishes at $120.

In this situation the short leg (110c) we sold would be worth $10 (120-110), meaning that we would owe $1,000 on that position. The long leg we bought would be worth $5 (120-115), meaning we are holding a position worth $500. The net effect is a $500 loss, but remember that‚Äôs netted against the $100 credit you received, so it‚Äôs a max loss of $400. That math checks out as the width of the spread is $5, the credit is $1, so the max loss is 5-1=$4*100=$400.

So that‚Äôs how it works upon expiration. But lets say this position moved against you, you still have a few days until expiration, but the stock is at $120. Since there are a few days left, you probably could close the contract for a debit of $3.50 rather than the max loss debit of $5. However, since your short leg is ITM the person you sold the option to may choose to exercise their option. As a result, that would require you to take on a short position of $110*100=$11,000 per contract sold. You may not be able to afford to cover that, or your broker may not let you hold that position. So what happens is your long leg gets exercised as well resulting in you taking a max loss early. So while on paper you received a credit of $1 that could have been closed for a debit of $3.50 and your loss was only $2.50, early assignment results in you prematurely taking a max loss.

When does this happen? It typically doesn‚Äôt, since it requires the buyer sacrificing the remaining extrinsic value on the option, but it‚Äôs more likely with certain stocks. There are three different classifications of a stock that relate to it‚Äôs borrowing ability: Easy to Borrow (ETB), Hard to Borrow (HTB), and Not Available to Borrow (NTB). The harder a stock is to borrow, the more likely it is that a call is exercised early because it gives the buyer a way to acquire a stock which may not be available to them through their broker. So if you‚Äôre selling call spreads that are close to being ITM, make sure to check out the borrowing status of the stock.

**2: Dividend Risk:**

This risk relates to the first one discussed, as it‚Äôs just another way you risk early assignment. If a company is announcing a dividend, there will be something known as an ‚Äúex-div‚Äù date, which means that all shareholders as of that date are entitled to receive the divident, which will be distributed usually at a later date. Because of this, call buyers may exercise an out of the money call option in an effort to acquire those shares.

Remembering that exercising an option means that you sacrifice all remaining extrinsic value, another reason a buyer may exercise a call option before an ex-dividend date is that the value of the dividend announced is greater than the extrinsic value remaining in the option. Say a 100c is trading at $2 and the underlying (stock) is currently at 101. The extrinsic value is the value of the option in excess of what it would be worth upon expiration. So the extrinsic value in this situation is $1, since the 100c trading for $2 is just $1 in excess of the current strike price. If the company in question here announced a $2 dividend, an option buyer would likely exercise their call option because the $2 dividend is greater than the $1 of extrinsic value.

**3: Pin Risk:**

We know that if your spread finishes out of the money it‚Äôs a max gain and if both legs of your spread finish in the money it‚Äôs a max loss. But what happens when the price of a stock finishes between the two legs of your spread? Let‚Äôs take a look.

So using a 100/110c spread as an example, let‚Äôs say that the stock finishes at 105. Your long leg, which is there to protect you, is worthless so you wouldn‚Äôt exercise it. However the short leg at 100 that you sold will be exercised by the buyer since it‚Äôs ITM. As a result, you‚Äôre now short 100 shares at a price of 100 and you‚Äôll be holding that position over the weekend. This can go both ways from here, but since we‚Äôre focused on risk let‚Äôs say that this stock you‚Äôre now short shoots up over the weekend and some sort of news/event brings it up to $120.

With this short position of 100 shares at $100 you‚Äôre borrowing $10,000 worth of stock. Now that the stock is worth $120 this position is now worth $12,000. Over the weekend you‚Äôve sustained a $2,000 loss. If we received a credit of $3 when we opened this spread, we may have thought that our max loss was 10-3=$7*100=$700. Since we failed to close the spread out, this position has now resulted in a $2,000 loss net of the $300 credit that you received when you opened the position. So on a trade where you thought you could lose at most $700, you‚Äôre now down almost $2k.

I can‚Äôt repeat it enough, but THIS IS WHY WE CLOSE OUT SPREADS BEFORE EXPIRATION. That is the single most important takeaway I can give you here. Spreads are great since they‚Äôre defined risk and defined gain. When you‚Äôre buying options you have a defined loss but a potentially infinite gain. This can make it really easy to get greedy and I‚Äôve seen countless traders lose big profits because they keep holding out for more. When you have a defined gain and defined loss it makes it easier to make smart decisions, take profits, and continuously build on those profits over time.

That was an enormous wall of text but I hope it helps explain, from a base level, what spreads are and how they work. Switching from buying options to selling options has dramatically changed my performance in the market so I hope sharing this can do the same for someone else.

227,Forbes: U.S. Stock Market Hits Record 77% Overvalued,1597954289.0,"[U.S. Stock Market Hits Record 77% Overvalued](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2020/08/18/us-stock-market-hits-record-77-overvalued/amp/)

Some extracts:

According to the popular *market cap to GDP ratio*, the U.S. stock market, collectively, is about 77.0% overvalued. Despite the worst economic backdrop since the Great Depression, stocks have held up reasonably well since the March 23 bottom. While it‚Äôs true that the stock market has disconnected from the underlying economy, it has also done so in the past. With such an extreme level of overvaluation, it does beg the question, ‚ÄúAre we witnessing the formation of another bubble?‚Äù

**Stock Valuation-How it Works**

One of the more popular methods used to determine if U.S. stocks are undervalued or overvalued is the *market cap to GDP ratio*. This ratio compares the total market cap of all U.S. publicly traded stocks with GDP. More specifically, it calculates the total value of the outstanding shares of all U.S. domiciled, publicly traded companies (the numerator), and divides that number by total GDP. For example, if total market cap was $20 trillion and GDP was the same, stocks would be considered fairly valued (eg; $20 trillion / $20 trillion = 1 {ie; 100%}). During this pandemic, GDP has fallen while stocks (and market cap) have risen, creating the highest level of overvaluation since the ratio began in January 1971. This is another way of saying that stocks are extremely overbought.

It‚Äôs important to note that stocks can remain overvalued for an extended period. However, at some point, stocks will fall (or GDP will rise), and the ratio will decline. While there is no way to be absolutely certain when this will occur, the ratio does offer insight.

Currently, the degree of overvaluation is around 77.6% (177.6% ‚Äì 100% = 77.6%). The previous record high was 49.3% on January 26, 2018. Prior to that, the highest reading was 49.0% overvalued in March 2000, just as the Tech Bubble burst.

Why was the ratio so low during the 1980s when stocks soared? Although stocks rose mightily during the decade, GDP was strong, which kept valuations from rising too much. Plus, when Reagan took office, stocks were more than 50% *undervalued*. While getting inflation down to a manageable level, Reagan began to deregulate various industries and embarked on a series of tax cuts, all of which created a boom period for the economy and the stock market.

**What About Today?**

A cursory glance at the far right of the chart will reveal a massive 32.9% drop in GDP (bottom graph) and a rising stock market (middle graph). The combination of the two have created the record overvaluation. Though we know the economy is improving, we do not know if the improvement will be enough to bring the ratio down to a more comfortable level.

There are other factors contributing to the record overvaluation. Very few investment categories offer a good alternative to the stock market. Cash is paying next to nothing and bond yields are at historic lows. You could invest in gold and silver and some high-flying tech stocks but buying these after such an increase could prove risky. With a lack of alternatives, you might say stocks are the only game in town. Moreover, suppressing interest rates helps to ‚Äústeer‚Äù investors into stocks ‚Äì a technique known as financial repression. Financial repression was first used by smaller, emerging economies when its debt became elevated. When an abundance of money flows into stocks, it tends to push stock prices higher, which in turn makes investors *feel* wealthier. This is known as the ‚Äúwealth effect.‚Äù Low interest rates also make it easier to repay debt.

233,I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!,1619818016.0,"**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it‚Äôs justified, given their clickbait titles or ‚Äú5 can't miss stocks of the century‚Äù or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,

>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it‚Äôs that Motley Fool is utter trash

Now that that‚Äôs out of the way, let‚Äôs come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool‚Äôs premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X‚Äôed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.

Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**

**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.

**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.

a. One-Quarter

b. One Year

c. Two Year

d. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)

Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday‚Äôs market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).

**Results:**

https://preview.redd.it/qg04a2wabbw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=0486800be95f3c49097df601935236a2bc500b11

 As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool‚Äôs recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \~2X and two-year returns were \~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark. 

https://preview.redd.it/xq68n5kbbbw61.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=327a831304a22ffb7588037b74da15e2de559e9b

But it‚Äôs not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla‚Äôs 2020 rally.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**

The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.

**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool‚Äôs premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013.

>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011

**Conclusion:**

I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it‚Äôs that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.

Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.

Since Amazon's early days, reviews are the one big metric customers have relied on to determine the quality and authenticity of a product. Amazon's listings often have hundreds or thousands of reviews, instead of the handful found on competing marketplaces. But many of those reviews can't be trusted. Thousands of fake reviews have flooded Amazon, Walmart, eBay and others, as sales have skyrocketed.

The repercussions are getting more serious, too, as shoppers stay home and increasingly turn online for things they'd normally want to shop for in person. In recent months, fake reviews have boosted sales of unsafe products and hurt business for legitimate sellers, causing huge brands to sever ties with Amazon.",2020-09-07 13:35:50

248,Is technical analysis science or pseudoscience? I wanted to find out. Sourced.,1621085631.0,"TL;DR - It looks like technical analysis doesn‚Äôt stand up to scientific scrutiny in any study I could find which took steps to filter out the effects of self fulfilling prophecy. I, personally, am choosing not to engage in it any further.

I was starting to learn technical analysis. However, I wasn‚Äôt getting any good results when backtesting (after I caught myself and took steps to stop myself from exerting my own confirmation bias on my tests). So I decided to try to dig into the science behind it to see if spending any further time studying it would be worth it.

I‚Äôm being careful here not to cherry pick data. The reason I‚Äôm focusing on the articles I‚Äôve linked is because they are the ones that bothered to take into account and take steps to eliminate results skewed by self fulfilling prophecies and confirmation bias. Aside from the last one which I included because it was the most comprehensive one I could find.

I wanted to know if technical analysis actually works. I didn‚Äôt want anecdotal evidence. I wanted scientific evidence.

This is what I found.

This first bit of research is by far the easiest to understand as it isn‚Äôt written in scientific jargon. It‚Äôs not quite as scientific as the others and was done by one person who had the same questions I did.

https://towardsdatascience.com/does-technical-analysis-work-heres-proof-a2b626a3fbe9

They tested MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands and Stochastic Oscillator.

They found that for all asset classes, with the exception of one, technical analysis had zero alpha. (No gains)

They were tested standalone and in combination with other indicators.

The only exception they found was Bitcoin, but they also threw in the side note that Bitcoin is primarily a retail driven asset and as retail investors believe in technical analysis it‚Äôs more likely that the combined buys and sells due to the belief in the indicators were causing the indicators to work and not the other way around.

However they did point out that, seemingly ironically, reversing filtered indicators had some slight positive alpha for non Bitcoin asset types.

They did mention they would have to test a much larger sample set to see if the Bitcoin alpha or the indicator reversal alpha with other asset classes would hold up.

But the correlation for other asset classes was so slight they acknowledged it wouldn‚Äôt be profitable.

Let‚Äôs look at another study. Now we‚Äôre getting really scientific and busting out mathematical equations with symbols that most of us can‚Äôt even read.

https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2158244017736799

They tested out some popular candlestick patterns on a market in Thailand over a 100 year period (they picked Thailand emerging markets to avoid the issue of data snooping). They tested the candlesticks along with Stochastics, RSI and MFI. They tested a number of different holding periods as well. 

They found that the candlestick patterns were not statistically significant and would not result in positive returns even when combined with other indicators.

Let‚Äôs look at yet another study. This one contains a bit of a case study but they do their own work to draw their own conclusions.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3967202/

This one is the only one that focused at all on resistance. They basically determine that the probability of bouncing correlates with the growth of the investors trust on following bounces. Essentially, it is a self fulfilling prophecy and the resistance lines only form because of the investors growing trust in the probability of a bounce.

The following is this real gem here.

https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Luis-Macedo-8/publication/349608864_An_Inquiry_into_the_Validity_of_Technical_Analysis_in_Financial_Markets_With_the_Use_of_Evolutionary_Techniques/links/60382c624585158939cdaeec/An-Inquiry-into-the-Validity-of-Technical-Analysis-in-Financial-Markets-With-the-Use-of-Evolutionary-Techniques.pdf

It‚Äôs really long. It‚Äôs really comprehensive. Though the authors do note their own results are inconclusive and this is more of a discussion starter. They did find a few actual positive correlations between certain samples, however they also did note that they were only reproducible during certain time spans.

I will wager my own best guess that the historical time spans where they did work were most likely the time spans where those methods were most frequently being used in those markets and could potentially be explained away as self fulfilling prophecies since as far as I could tell this is the one study I listed where they didn‚Äôt necessarily use criteria that would exclude that bias from the results.

What will I gain from the hours of reading I just did on these topics? I will conclude that technical analysis is not something which I will personally put any more time into learning. I think any of the proven correlations which I could find were not significant enough to result in gains, especially after taking slippage and brokerage fees into account. Furthermore, the methods which did have a positive correlation only seemed to be effective during certain historical times or in domains ruled by retail traders due to the self fulfilling prophecy.

In addition, quite a bit of information in some of these studies showed that all of those indicators were outperformed by simple buy and hold strategies.

I‚Äôm sure that more than a few people will disagree with me here. But these are my own conclusions. Take from it what you will.",2021-05-15 06:33:51

281,Apple & Tesla Announced Stock Splits; Here‚Äôs How It Could Impact Your Investments,1597352199.0,"## What‚Äôs A Stock Split And How It Could Affect Your Current Holdings

Apple and Tesla, arguably two of the hottest companies on [Wall Street](http://www.stockmarket.com/investing), both announced stock splits in recent weeks. The question is, can it positively affect your current holdings? First, let‚Äôs understand what a stock split is. Essentially, a stock split is exactly what it sounds like. One share is splitting up into a few individual shares. This often comes after a particular share price has been inflated to a level that may be ‚Äòtoo high‚Äô. For example, in [Tesla](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=TSLA) 5-for-1 stock split example, one share worth $1500 now will be broken into 5 shares worth $300 each. This way, it will lower the entry barrier for investors who wish to buy a stake in the company.

A stock split can typically result in a share price increase following a decrease immediately after the split. Since many retail investors find the stock now more affordable, they end up boosting demand and driving up prices. A stock split also reminds investors that the share price had been increasing in the past. It is not surprising that many investors extrapolate the historical growth into the future and bid up the share price again. One thing to also note is that even though the number of outstanding shares increases and stock price decreases, the market capitalization doesn‚Äôt change.

# Who Tend To Benefit From Stock Splits?

Generally speaking, stock splits are neutral events for current shareholders. In the case of the Apple 4-for-1 stock split, you used to own 1 share, but moving forward you will own 4, but the total value remains the same. Essentially, a stock split wouldn‚Äôt change the company value, all else being equal. But the truth is, all else is rarely equal when we apply it in the market.

Both TSLA stock and [AAPL stock](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=AAPL) jumped after the announcement. This may be the fifth time for Apple to do a stock split, but it is Tesla‚Äôs first. The price change will be more dramatic for Tesla, whose stock split will bring individual share to the $300 range. Compared to Apple‚Äôs post-split of $100 range, Tesla‚Äôs post-split stock might find it harder to attract smaller investors.

Certain online brokerages offer investors to buy fractional stocks. Conceptually, it offers the same thing in the absence of stock splits. Then again, not all brokerages will offer such services and it‚Äôs not that easy to move shares between brokerages. Therefore, it will not create a much stronger demand than actual stock splits. Now, like it or not, news of stock splits tend to cause share prices to jump. And that is not really rational. But who cares? As long as the prices go up, existing shareholders would not be complaining.

## Tesla & Apple‚Äôs Stock Splits Could Restart The Trend Again.

Is stock splits a thing in the past? Tracing back the history, in 1997, 102 companies in the [S&P 500](https://stockmarket.com/ticker?symbol=SPY) split their stocks, and in 2016, only 7 companies did so, a decline of more than 90%. That is about to change when two of the hottest tech companies announced they will be splitting their shares at the end of this month. The zero brokerage fees environment gives companies a greater incentive to split shares today. In addition, it creates a more affordable and accessible stock for Robinhood traders to start trading. After all, many retail investors are nonetheless still prone to judging how ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù a stock is based on its dollar value. That said, it is not surprising to see other tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, or Alphabet make such moves on their own timeline.",2020-08-13 13:56:39
282,"90% of traders lose money, the 10% make money from the 90%",1589761501.0,"Correct me if I am wrong but I came to this theory as I did some accounting/bookkeeping for a day trader.

Trading money is very volatile. Some days you make 10, next day your up 20, third day you are down 50 etc...This is even with swing trading you will lose money on some swings, even options which seem like throwing money in the air predicting the future. This is hit and miss.

Sure with consistency you will end with profits at the end of the year. The main way the 10% of traders make money is they make some ""trading strategy,"" and end up selling courses on the strategy, and also make a platform where they share trades and people paying monthly subscriptions, make a book and people buy their trading book...etc. I saw that this is consistant and stable income from my day trading friend who is a successful day trader...he simply makes money from the 90% of day traders who pay him for courses, subscriptions, books, classes etc.

I guess what I am trying to say is unless you are like my friend who is dedicating his life to trading and teaching you are better off long term investing, learning a skill which will lead to higher pay and equity and consistent income.

288,Joe Rogan's $100 Million Spotify Deal,1590196837.0,"Joe ""podcast is moving to Spotify"" Rogan made [headlines recently when he announced that he has signed an exclusive deal with Spotify](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/business/media/joe-rogan-spotify-contract.html).

The multi-year deal is reportedly worth more than $100 million.

Within just 48 hours of the announcement, [Spotify's market cap increased by nearly $4 billion](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotifys-market-cap-value-soars-by-nearly-4bn-in-wake-of-landmark-joe-rogan-podcast-deal/), to it's highest point in nearly two years.

At the time of the announcement, Spotify's share price was around $169, with a market cap around $31BN. As of yesterday, their share price hit an all time high of over $195, with a market cap around $36BN.

Clearly, this is a big coup for Spotify, who have nabbed the biggest name in the podcast world and one of the biggest stars on YouTube.

His podcast is the number one podcast in the world and gets as many as 190 million downloads per month. In fact, he was [Forbes highest-paid podcaster of 2019, raking in $30 million](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/02/03/crime-does-pay-my-favorite-murder-stars-join-joe-rogan-as-highest-earning-podcasters/#177986913773).

Of course, this had led to a discussion about the value of content, specifically the value assigned to music and longer form content like Rogan's podcast.

According to music writer [Ted Gioia, a musician would need to generate 23 billion streams on Spotify to earn what they're paying Joe Rogan for his podcast rights](https://twitter.com/tedgioia/status/1262930316253110276).

It is important to understand the context here:

**For every dollar in revenue the Spotify earns, it sends 65 cents straight to the record industry.**

**This caps Spotify's earnings potential, and means that it has a less robust business model than Netflix.**

**For example, if Netflix pays, say, $30 million to make a new season of Ozark, that cost doesn't increase if it attracts more eyeballs. Media Rights Capital, which produces the show, makes the same money from Netflix regardless of whether the audience is 5,000 or 5 million.**

**However, that is not the case with Spotify: costs** ***rise*** **with subscribers.**

**Every stream will see another slice of the listener's monthly subscription fee go to the record label.**

Spotify has a gross margin of around 25%, whereas Netflix has a gross margin of around 38%.

Spotify has recently spent more than $600 million acquiring four podcasting firms, [including the $250 million acquisition of Ringer earlier this year.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-11/spotify-said-to-pay-250-million-for-ringer-in-podcasting-drive)

Therefore, for a capped cost, Spotify can attract new listeners and potential subscribers. Also, the more time listeners spend on podcasts, the less money Spotify gives to the record labels.

[The deal has raised comparisons with Howard Stern](https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielshapiro/2020/05/19/the-new-howard-stern-podcast-giant-joe-rogan-inks-exclusive-deal-with-spotify/) and SiriusXM, which has made Stern a fortune.

[In 2019 alone, Stern took home an estimated $93 million.](https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-stern/#5bedd7033dc7)

If video killed the radio star, did Spotify just kill the YouTube star?

Or is this a smart move on Rogan's part?

After all, it is expected that some clips will remain on YouTube for the casual algorithm viewers.

Rogan has previously been [critical of YouTube's demonetisation policy and censorship on the platform](https://reclaimthenet.org/joe-rogan-youtube-demonetization-policies/).

Overall, Rogan is banking a guaranteed $100 million in an [uncertain economic environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAfJMNtxsU).

Although some have commented that he is sacrificing the scale provided by YouTube, he may well still have his clips channel on YouTube.

As well as this, he is *licensing* his podcast.

Therefore, if it fails, he has pocketed $100 million and can return to other platforms, thus generating more press.

If it succeeds, he has pocketed $100 million and will have more leverage in the next contract negotiations.

Now that's a win-win.

What are your thoughts on the move?

The question is if these lawmakers/senators would force the airlines to refund the passengers or would they sleep with the airlines?

After hitting record levels in the Dow and the S&P, the market consolidated its gain, finishing the day even or slightly red. Ahead of the US Thanksgiving holiday, optimism over a relatively quick rollout of a coronavirus vaccine propelled the Dow Jones to above 30,000 points for the first time and the S&P to record highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has been beaten down recently as market participants rotate to cyclical and reopening stocks also posted a strong week.

Countering the optimism is the reality that the coronavirus pandemic has been surging the last few weeks, raising the specter of further restrictions. As of Tuesday, there 88,080 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus pandemic

Finally, after four painful weeks, the surge in coronavirus infections are showing early signs of improvement. The national weekly average for daily new infections is 172,118, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. While that is an all-time record, it only represents an 11% increase to last week. In the past four weeks, average daily new infections were posting a roughly 30-40% increase every week. The daily average deaths are more than 1,500, similar level to early May.

Today was a slow day, in terms of news. With Thanksgiving coming up, markets are closed tomorrow and open only half-day Friday

The political uncertainty in the United States is beginning to clear up. Weeks after Joe Biden was declared President-Elect, General Service Administration (GSA) head Emily Murphy acknowledged Biden‚Äôs win and approved the official transition process. The GSA is a government agency that works largely behind the scenes to support other federal entities, with responsibility for managing federal office space, procuring supplies and improving the use of technology across the government. The GSA provides a presidential transition team with Washington office space and coordinates access to federal agencies to plan potential policy changes with current administration officials, using $6.3 million allocated to support its efforts. This will finally allow Biden‚Äôs team to gain access to crucial information needed to effectively govern the nation. Mark Haefele, UBS Global chief investment officer, said, ‚ÄúWe believe that the recent reduction in political uncertainty in the U.S., though far from complete, is another supportive factor behind the recent stock rally,

Markets were also encouraged by Biden‚Äôs appointment of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to Treasury  Secretary. Yellen served as Fed Chair from 2014-2018, helping steer the historic bull market that followed the 2008 recession.

The chance of getting a new stimulus: **when pigs fly.** 

To make it short, when the stock market was open yesterday, Trump tweeted that he would not sign any new trillion-dollar stimulus into law until after the election. Then, later in the evening, he sent out tweets saying he would sign billion-dollar ""skinny"" stimulus bills, such as $1,200 checks and 135B for PPP. Mitch McConnell came out earlier in the evening supporting Trump's original position to not pass any new stimulus and promised to ram Amy Coney Barrett through the Senate. Of course, Jerome Powell is left in ruins.

At this point, anyone who thinks we are going to get anything from the federal government, especially from Mitch McConnell, is way too optimistic. Get ready for a bumpy ride in the stock market, especially the election results would not be finalized until early December and hopes in new stimulus is as far reaching as seeing the end of the pandemic.

Even if Trump changes his mind tomorrow, Mitch McConnell will be determined to butcher anything that comes from Nancy Pelosi. And, Nancy is not going to pass anything smaller than 2 trillions. We are not getting anything.",2020-10-07 09:03:14

311,A realistic view of how this will all play out,1585527933.0,"I'm trying to think of how all this madness will play out realistically. All I see are posts either saying it's the end of the world or everything will snap back like a rubber band the moment people are allowed outside of their houses.

Things are changing fast around the globe at the moment so it's hard to keep track of exactly what's what but over a third of the globe is under some kind of lockdown at the moment. In some places it means that people can't go out in public unless it's specifically to get groceries or other urgent product/service while in others it's only a recommendation to stay home as much as possible, and in still other places, the Tide Pods crowd is licking toilet seats. Regardless, a huge part of the financially relevant world are on lockdown and/or (most of)  the citizens are doing their best to practice isolation and social distancing.

As it is, there is nothing on the immediate horizon that promises a cure. A vaccine will take a year or more. Chloroquine needs testing before it can be used and reports of its efficacy are spotty. Even if a miracle were delivered tomorrow morning, people would have to get their hands on it and that takes time. We are probably looking at at least another two to three weeks in the miracle scenario. More likely, we are looking at anywhere from 2-6 months before life even starts to look like normal again if we depend on herd immunity and/or minimizing the virus' circulation.

For argument's sake, let's say it's 3 months until the pandemic threat is removed enough to return to normal life.

So, how does this all play out economically?

During these three months, a lot of people are laid off/unemployed, receiving less than a normal income. Rent/mortgage payments are suspended but piling up the whole time. So are other payments. Cars, internet, etc. Everything that their UI check doesn't cover. At the same time, a whole lot of small businesses will never be able to catch up on the accumulation of debt over that time and will go bust. It's not like we'll just hit play and the world picks up where it left off.

There will be fewer jobs available to return to because of the businesses that went under. People will have less money in their savings accounts to spend on shiny new toys. Those that avoided infection will continue to be scared by it. (No vaccine for another 9-15 months yet.)

So now we have fewer businesses open, more people out of work, less disposable income available for those that did keep their jobs and some people still scared to go out and gather in crowded places. On top of all this is the realization by many the need for a rainy day fund and that ANYTHING can happen. I expect people will want to save more than usual (at least until they forget, which I understand is not very long for most humans, but still. lol)

How anyone can believe the economy snaps back and goes full throttle in that time is beyond my understanding. OTOH, I also don't see how this could spell the end of the world and 1929 all over again.

What I think is likely to happen:

\- people will resume buying the essentials immediately (and things they perceive as essential). Once people are back to their daily grind, they still need gas, they still need to repair their cars, they still need clothes and groceries, etc. They'll go back to eating lunch at McDonald's twice a week and their Starbucks coffees every morning. This stuff will snap back pretty fast. (Which cheap stocks to get into now for that snap back?)

\- new iPhones will have to wait till debt is paid off. So will that new sofa, that new car, etc. These things will take longer but will eventually recover as people forget. (Stocks to avoid for a while?)

\- some things may never recover or take an awful lot longer to forget and require years and years for people to resume. Cruise lines, for example. (Better be willing to wait 10 years plus to reach new highs.)

Thoughts?

Edit: Although I'm interested in hearing other takes on how this will actually play out, none of us really know and we're all just taking our best guesses. What I'm really interested in with this thread is identifying stocks that are ""daily essentials"" (either real or perceived) that will snap back fast, ""non-essentials"" (things that people are willing to forgo for a while) that will get back eventually but take a bit more time, and those that people will actively avoid for the foreseeable future like cruise lines.

Edit 2: I landed on 3 months, not because I believe the virus will be gone by then necessarily (I don't), but I do think it's possible we could reach critical level herd immunity to keep the curve flat enough to handle the number of patients and/or I think that people will get sick enough of staying locked up they won't be as willing to stay in anymore. It'll be June, the nice weather will be in play and it's also possible that viral activity is somewhat muted in warm weather (though I'm not counting on it considering the number of infections in places like the Philippines, Indonesia, etc). Anyway, 3 months is less a prediction than it is an assumption for the sake of argument.",2020-03-29 17:25:33

TLDR: Hertz still has almost 250 million shares authorized (but not outstanding) and they want to sell them to raise $1 billion to fund their bankruptcy. 

I thought I had seen everything in this market but this just shows you that nothing is off the table. Before you buy HTZ, please realize that if you participate in this offering (if it even ends up being allowed, which is questionable), all you're doing is paying off HTZ debt and throwing money at Jeffries for underwriting it.

On the flip side, given the current market conditions, it's not the worst idea and while IMO it's disgustingly predatory I can't say I blame HTZ for trying to take advantage of this market nonsense. If they do manage to convince a court to allow this, it actually does give equity holders a chance to get something which they certainly won't get if it just goes the pure bankruptcy route. I suppose if you just have blind faith that HTZ can come out of bankruptcy and be a better company then it makes sense to gamble on it, as long as you realize you're buying something for $4 a share that is literally worth zero. This is truly the greater fool theory in action. What a time to be alive lol

314,Am I losing my mind for thinking this market is completely disconnected from reality?,1589835385.0,"It seems like the bad news outweighs the good news 10 to 1 yet any slightly positive news gets traded like it‚Äôs the oracles of a God and any bad news no matter how dire gets traded like it‚Äôs already priced in.  Will the markets ever reconnect with reality and would that be a 1929 event?  I‚Äôm on the bearish side of things mainly because I can‚Äôt find a logical argument to support the narrative we are going back to 30k on the Dow in the second half of this year.  Every fiber in my body is saying things are ridiculously overpriced at the moment given the reality unfolding.  I do believe absolutely that we will recover, but I don‚Äôt see a realistic scenario for that until next year.  It‚Äôs like conspiracy theories and rampant speculation have become the new truth.  Maybe I have lost my mind, but nothing about any of this makes any sense.  But that is the saying that markets can remain illogical longer than you can remain solvent so I would say tread with some caution in either direction you are betting on.

Edit: thanks for all the feedback.  I am open to being totally wrong so I don‚Äôt want to say I am 100% certain of my thinking, but it makes the most sense to me at this time.  That may change with time obviously.  I guess what is fueling my pessimism is that I work in the service industry which saw and unprecedented 85% drop in business in my area during the shutdown.  We furloughed and laid off about half our staff.  Our state has reopened, but yet we aren‚Äôt seeing any huge surge in business not even this week.  We have picked up, but only enough to support the skeleton crew we are working with.  There isn‚Äôt any strong signs yet we we be able to bring back all our workers in the near future.  I fear that many of our furloughed workers will turn into permanent lay-offs.  I guess that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm seeing for the service industry; us operating at 60-70% our normal levels for the rest of the year.  And if it‚Äôs doing that to us then what is it going to do to other industries like retail, restaurants, and entertainment which are in much more vulnerable positions?  But extrapolating what I am seeing on the ground into a macro-picture could be mis-leading, but it has me spooked enough that I‚Äôm not going to bet heavily on this rally.  There are deals to be had though, but just use some caution and probably avoid meme stocks.

Edit 2: My state reopened May 1st so it‚Äôs been about 3 weeks and we have yet to see this ‚Äúreturn to normal‚Äù even though our state is fairing quite well with the virus and our case count is consistently dropping even with the reopen.  I do agree that states that stay closed too long are doing unnecessary damage to their economies at this point.  Unless you are New York or New Jersey then it‚Äôs probably time to start doing a phased reopening.  But what I am seeing on the ground is not anywhere close to a ‚Äúreturn to normal‚Äù and we are 3 weeks into our reopening.  That is what is spooking me.  I do believe we will return to normal, but I anticipate it being much further away that the markets are currently pricing it in to being.  But again I could totally have this read wrong.",2020-05-18 13:56:25

Demetri Kofinas speaks with Tony Greer, editor of the Morning Navigator and founder of TG Macro.  This episode begins with a clip from David Portnoy (a.k.a Barstool Dave or Davey Daytrader), in what is probably the most epic hype video ever created for stock trading.   

Portnoy has come to personify not only the recent rip-roaring retracement in equities, but also, the philosophy that the stock market no longer bears any relationship to the real economy. ‚ÄúIt took me a while to figure out that the stock market isn‚Äôt connected to the economy,‚Äù according to David Portnoy. ‚ÄúI tell people there are two rules to investing: Stocks only go up, and if you have any problems, see rule No. 1.‚Äù  

Extraordinary monetary interventions remain the single most important causal factor for explaining this phenomenon (what we have referred to on this show as ‚Äúmarket nihilism‚Äù). Whether investment flows are coming from passive funds or ‚Äúpassive people,‚Äù what‚Äôs important is that the allocators invest indiscriminately. As the popular fraise goes: ‚ÄúAlways buy the fucking dip‚Äù ([\#ABTFD](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23ABTFD))  

In our past episodes with Mike Green, we have explored the role of systematic passive investment vehicles in driving markets higher. With the recent return of the retail investor an additional layer of passivity has been added. Not only are these investors seemingly ‚Äúprice inelastic,‚Äù but they also exhibit a disturbing level of indifference to fundamentals that is qualitatively different from anything seen in past generations. Unlike the Gen-X and Boomer cohorts of 1999 who felt that they could see a future that others could not yet perceive, this generation of zoomers and millennials seems to feel that they have figured out something far more fundamental about how things work today. In their view, the notion that the stock market has any relationship to economic reality is laughable. Fundamentals can‚Äôt hold a candle to Jay Powell and his money printer. Along with this realization comes a mocking, self-deprecatory celebration of aberrance. Indeed, going through r/WallStreetBets or wojack images on crypto subreddits exposes you to imagery that is reminiscent of a scene from the Island of Dr. Moreau.  

In their 90-minute conversation, Tony and Demetri explore all of these themes. They discuss the recent rip-roaring retracement in equities and how the Federal Reserve, with its relentless money-printing has broken the economy, turned the stock market into a casino, and sown the seeds for a political crisis unlike any we have seen in more than a generation.",2020-06-18 14:30:15

[**On Tuesday**](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jeff-bezos-just-sold-18-billion-in-amazon-stock-2020-02-04), filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed that the Amazon founder and CEO had sold 905,456 shares on Friday and Monday for a total of $1.84 billion. According to new [**SEC**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000089924320003505/xslF345X03/doc4.xml)[**filings**](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000089924320003503/xslF345X03/doc4.xml) Thursday, Bezos sold an additional 810,912 shares Tuesday and Wednesday for around $1.65 billion. That brings his nearly weeklong total to more than 1.7 million shares sold for about $3.49 billion.

The four-day selloff equates to about 3% of his total Amazon [**AMZN,** **+0.51%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/amzn?mod=MW_story_quote) ¬† stake.

The sales were pre-arranged, though they coincided with Amazon becoming just the fourth U.S. company [**to reach $1 trillion in market cap** ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-is-officially-worth-1-trillion-joining-other-tech-titans-2020-02-04)earlier this week.

A decade ago, no major automaker was going to bet on a non-existent electric-vehicle market. Big Auto was happy to sit back and watch Tesla try to create a new segment. But now, almost every carmaker has announced significant electric-vehicle ambitions for the coming decade.

Make no mistake: Without Tesla, this wouldn't be happening. We'd still be asking the circa 2006 question, ""Who killed the electric car?"" if Tesla hadn't reset the EV race in the years before the financial crisis, narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and positioned itself to deliver half a million vehicles in 2021 (and gift investors with a 9,200% return).

Now, the global EV market is poised to grow, especially in China, where auto sales are already millions more annually than in the US, with the potential to top out at twice what the US sees every year, around 16-17 million new cars, trucks, and SUVs. A large percentage of those new sales could be electric, and automakers don't want Tesla to capture them all.

352,Trump Administration Seeks to Delist U.S.-Listed Chinese Companies for Blocking Audit Inspections,1597132380.0,"The Donald Trump administration issued a set of recommendations intended to address the long-running inability of the U.S. audit regulator‚Äîthe PCAOB‚Äîto inspect accounting firms based in China whose audit clients are listed in U.S. stock markets. One plan would toughen listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges for what the administration calls non-cooperating jurisdictions (NCJs). But this really targets China as other countries have agreements with the PCAOB.

For Chinese companies‚Äîsuch as tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu, Inc.‚Äîthat want to continue with their listing or want to initiate listing on a U.S. exchange, the PCAOB must have access to audit work papers of the principal audit firm. Companies that cannot grant access because of government restrictions can satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an accounting firm ‚Äúwith comparable resources and experience‚Äù that the PCAOB determined can conduct proper exams.

The new listing standard gives a transition period until January 1, 2022, for already listed companies. The new standards will be immediately applied to new listings after rulemakings become effective.

Details of the recommendations are in a July 24, 2020, report drafted by the President‚Äôs Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets. PWG is chaired by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and he made the report public on August 6. This responds to a June 4 memorandum by President Trump directing the PWG to come up with plans to address the problem.

I used insights from behavioral economics, an alternative dataset and AI to turn this in to practice. Below I worked out the thought process behind the indicator which I wanted to share and bounce ideas off.

&#x200B;

 The thought proces behind the indicator is divided in to the three components already mentioned, a behavioural psychology part, an alternative big data part and the AI part. Or just scroll down to see the final result compared to the S&P 500.

**The psychology part**

The fact that you are more cautious when you just witnessed an accident is called availability bias in the school of behavioural finance. It describes the notion that people judge the probability of something happening more likely when an example more easily comes to mind. So for example you probably overestimate the probability of a shark attack when you have just read about in the news. You could argue that the same goes for economic principles. People are more likely to believe inflation is coming when the news is full of it. Or that a recession is coming when everyone is tweeting about it. Or that a stock is going up when its all over Reddit. Point is that news can drive the market, rather than just report or follow on it. In this respect also the recent work of Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller is relevant. His book Narrative Economics describes how stories can propel economic events. But how can one assess what people are reading, or what news they are exposed to? This is where alternative data and AI play their part.

**The alternative data part**

Traditional finance data is usually nice to work with, it is clean, nicely structured and most data is readily available. Unfortunately that is also it‚Äôs drawback, since everyone is looking at it, it is hard to gain an edge. Alternative data however usually is instructed and messy, but it is unique. One of the largest alternative data sources is the internet. Terabytes of data are generated every minute and with this indicator we want to take advantage of that.

Therefore I created a dataset with financial news articles from well know websites, financial tweets and other sources of financial news combined to one large dataset with unstructured alternative data. With this data we can see to what news investors are exposed to. And here is the cool thing, if we think about our behavioural flaws discussed in the first part, we can make a prediction as to where investors‚Äô availability bias is headed to. Put differently, is we know if investors are reading more negative or positive news, we can try to predict if their investment decisions will be positive (i.e. long) or if they will be negative (i.e. short). Unfortunately going through all this data and seeing for every news article, tweet etc whether it‚Äôs positive or negative is quite undoable. But here is the good news, we can let a computer do that and that is where the AI part comes in.

**The AI part**

AI is getting smarter and smarter almost daily it seems. And more importantly, big AI libraries are available to everyone with a computer running Python. Google (TensorFlow) and Facebook (PyTorch) are so kind to make their AI libraries open source, which puts some really powerful tools at the tips of your fingers. In this case we will let AI do two tasks:

\- Read headlines (ML zero shot sentiment classification)

\- Predict returns over a certain horizon

For this paper we will only discuss the first task, the next one is for another post.

To summarize the first two steps, first we discussed how people are influenced by what they read, second we showed that with alternative data we obtain what they read. The next (and hardest) part is actually reading and classifying. Since we have about 1000 daily news articles we have to let a computer to this, which we do by means of AI/Machine learning. We can use a model that is trained to classify a string of text as either optimistic (scoring it with a max of +1) to pessimistic (scoring it with a minimum of -1). How we do this is quite technical and will be explained in a different post, but the end result is a dataset of more than a million articles classified from +1 (optimistic) to -1 (pessimistic). Now the final step, checking whether the theory we proposed in the first part holds any truth when checking the data.

**Tying it all together**

So to recap, academic research shows how news can influence investor sentiment, we have alternative (big) data that contains all this news, and we have a computer that can interpret that news faster than any human can. You can check out how this graphically looks on: 

[https://www.alternative-analytics.eu/indicators/](https://www.alternative-analytics.eu/indicators/)

&#x200B;

The dashed line shows the S&P500, the other one our sentiment indicator. The vertical axis shows sentiment (negative to positive) and the horizontal axis is time. You can clearly see how sentiment was already decreasing before the market collapsed under COVID fear. Interestingly you also sentiment improving before the market recovered. So at the least we can see from that this plot that there is a relation between our indicator and S&P stock prices. This shows how new technology and improvement in AI is giving us a new way for looking at the market.",2020-12-14 17:35:37

377,The Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time,1579223948.0,"Renaissance Technologies is the Greatest Hedge Fund of All Time.

Founded by math genius Jim Simons, it's flagship fund Medallion has an average gross return of 66.1% since 1988.

With an average net return of 39.1% after fees.

The Medallion Fund is available only to current and past employees and their families, closing to outside investors in 1993.

Since, 1988, the Medallion Fund has racked up trading profits of more than $100 billion.

Now, I mentioned a net return of 39.1% after fees: well, the fees have been greater than the usual '2 and 20' structure (which means a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee).

Medallion has had a 5% management fee, and from 1988 to 2001, a 20% performance fee and from 2002 until now, a 44% performance fee.

Notice in particular the return in 2007 and 2008, a time when many were completely REKT.

In 2008, a return (after these monstrous fees) of 82.4%

**To make us all feel terrible, if you had invested $1000 into Medallion in 1988 you would have today, after fees, around $23MM**.

That certainly beats inflation...

So, how did they do it and what can we take away from this story (aside from searing jealousy)?

&#x200B;

**PART 1: The Early Stages**

Early on, Simons had a goal of algorithmic investing.

Remember, this was the late 1980s before the phrase big data became a household name and most investment decisions were made over the phone based on gut with the likes of Jordan Belfort trying to scam you!

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to have to worry about the market every minute. I want models that will make money while I sleep,‚Äù Simons said. ‚ÄúA pure system without humans interfering.‚Äù

Simons hired Sandor Straus to help him collect historic commodity information

Straus‚Äô was essential to Renaissance Technologies early success in commodities trading.

He became somewhat of a data guru ensuring pricing was consistent and accurate, checking his numbers matched with yearbook data provided by commodity exchanges, Wall Street Journal, other newspapers and anything else he could get his hands on.

Over time, Straus and his colleagues discovered additional historical pricing data, helping the development of new predictive models.

In fact, some of the stock market data they'd later find went back as far as the 1800s!

At the time, the team couldn't do much with the data, BUT the ability to search modern history to see how markets reacted to unusual events would later help Simon's team build models to profit from market collapses and so called 'Black Swan events'.

The return in 2008 is a prime example of that.

Commodity markets were relatively simple and RenTec found success in deploying simple trading strategies.

The fund wasn't bothered as to why these trading patterns existed - the only thing that mattered is that they occurred in a predictable and actionable way.

&#x200B;

**PART 2: Intellectual Capital**

Now in order to build these quantitative models, RenTec is composed of mathematicians and physicists of the highest order and it has even been described as the ""best math department in the world"".

Therefore, their quantitative researchers are well aware of the problems with data mining, over-fitting and spurious signals.

We are taking A LOT of data: 9TB per day in fact.

RenTec originally focussed on trading commodities, currencies and futures.

The strategies were mainly trending (i.e. price will continue to move in same direction) and mean reversion (i.e. price will return to original value).

Simons was experimenting in the stock market (equities) since the late 1980s but the strategy that had worked well on futures was not working on equities.

In 1995, David Magerman, an early employee, spotted a line of simulation code used for the equity trading system showing the S&P 500 at an unusually low level.

This test code appeared to use a figure from back in 1991 that was roughly half the current number.

It had been written as a static figure, rather than as a variable that updated with each move in the market.

Magerman also spotted an algebraic error elsewhere in the code.

Finally, the simulator‚Äôs algorithms could finally recommend an ideal portfolio for the trading system to execute.

The resulting portfolio seemed to generate big profits, at least according to Magerman‚Äôs calculations.

Only then did Renaissance commit significant capital into the equity markets, and since then...well, pretty good....

&#x200B;

**PART 3: Infrastructure**

Now I mentioned before about the sheer amount of data RenTec is utilising.

Big data has obviously caught on, but many hedge funds continue to under-perform the market and even some hedge funds focussed on quant methods haven't fared too well.

The problem, and one of the reasons RenTec is so special, is the barrier to entry is so incredibly high:

Building a data pipeline and the infrastructure required to process that data is no trivial matter.

To then get profitable trading signals from that processed data is a mammoth task.

RenTec has been in the game for over 30 years, constantly refining their algorithms and improving the efficiency of their data processing pipeline.

They have completely automated the process of signal discovery:

They don't hire researchers to manually derive novel insights or trading models from data, and they don't really bother with exclusive sources of data. Instead, they hire researchers to improve methods for automatically processing vast amounts of arbitrary data and extracting profitable trading signals from it.

RenTec has automated the data processing and feature extraction pipeline end to end.

The data is a pure abstraction to them. They don't bother with forming hypotheses and trying to find data to test them, they allow their algorithms to actively discover new correlations from the ground up. So many quantitative funds advertise how much data they work with, and how they have all these exotic sources of data at their disposal - but the data does not matter. The models for the data do not matter.

The mathematics of *efficiently processing* that data are what matters.

**CONCLUSION:**

**The takeaway from this is the following: do not day trade, you will get REKT.**

**You are competing with immense infrastructure and intellectual capital of the highest level.**

400,Netflix Is Now Worth More Than Comcast,1527137364.0,"
Netflix Inc. overtook cable giant Comcast Corp. in market value on Wednesday, highlighting the dramatic rise of video streaming at the expense of traditional television.

Netflix, the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index this year, set a fresh record with a gain of 3.4 percent on Wednesday, while Comcast fell 1.8 percent. That pushed Netflix‚Äôs market value to about $149 billion, surpassing Comcast at $147 billion.

It‚Äôs the second time this month that Netflix has dethroned Comcast in valuation, but the lead may have more sticking power this time. Shares of the video-streaming company have risen more than 5 percent this week, which began with the announcement of a multiyear production deal with Barack and Michelle Obama.

Comcast and other cable providers have faced growing competition from streaming services like Netflix, which are attracting more customers by adding original programming. Comcast said last month that it lost 96,000 video subscribers in the first quarter , a bigger decline than analysts had expected.

What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks & months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let‚Äôs go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let‚Äôs start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company‚Äôs total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook‚Äôs with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that‚Äôs 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home & Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more & more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn‚Äôt forget the Apple Card & Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital & contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.

It‚Äôs reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple‚Äôs current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don‚Äôt have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don‚Äôt be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let‚Äôs take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home & accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more & more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card & Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don‚Äôt forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company‚Äôs supplier‚Äôs ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&D and SG&A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don‚Äôt see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.

Moving on, let‚Äôs see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.

Let‚Äôs move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it‚Äôs safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don‚Äôt even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today‚Äôs price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don‚Äôt think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let‚Äôs look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news & sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn‚Äôt have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it‚Äôs likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock.

Will Disney+ make this company a must have? What is my price prediction for Disney?** **Read until the end of the post** **as I reveal my price target for Disney and what I expect to happen next**

**\~Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and stock analysis in which we will go into an in-depth analysis about Disney‚Äôs stock! We are going to talk about Disney as a company and what‚Äôs the upside for the stock! So, let‚Äôs go over the company a little before moving on to some fundamental, technical analysis, predictions, cash flows analysis and my price target for the stock in the next years & months.

Let‚Äôs start by talking a little about [Disney](https://ibb.co/PMhMz9f), yeah, I know everyone knows Disney, their movies, their parks and much more, but I believe Disney is still undervalued at this current price, especially due to their Disney+ and other streaming businesses which have taken of since the start of 2020.

Disney is the biggest entertainment company in the world, and has the 20th biggest market cap as they operate a number of profitable segments including cable networks like Disney, ESPN and many more others, while they also have a vast segment of parks & experiences including multiple Disneyland resorts, cruise lines and many others. Disney also operates a studio entertainment business under multiple big names like Marvel, Pixar, Walt Disney pictures and also offer Direct-to-Consumer networks & streaming services like Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and others. The company has over 200K employees and is nearing 100 years since it was founded.

So, we have to talk about the adjustment Disney has made starting in 2020. The company has cut the [dividend](https://ibb.co/YQQ8xLL) payouts and has focus its efforts into growing the company, with the company accelerating their move to an elite streaming business, which was supposed to have a time horizon of at least 3-4 years, and which has now surpassed all their expectations, and made the stock pop to all time highs of over $180 just recently.

Disney just had their latest Investors Day meeting in which they announced a lot of promising business opportunities for the company related to their developing streaming business.

They announced at least 10 Marvel [series](https://ibb.co/RQrxPfR) like Captain Marvel 2, a new Doctor Strange development while continuing [movies](https://ibb.co/87CcQ7B) for Thor, Black Panther and [others](https://ibb.co/Dpr73G2). They also announced at least 10 Star Wars [series](https://ibb.co/9HBrXZj) [including](https://ibb.co/PZkKTC4) the continuation of their big hit The Mandalorian and also provided updates on more child friendly productions with 15 Disney & Pixar [series](https://ibb.co/HNkMYvT).

The company has far outpaced any of their previous [GUIDANCE](https://ibb.co/vhWGCRd), as their initial guidance in all 3 big streaming services, Disney+, Hulu & ESPN have been reached in less than a year, with Disney+ and ESPN+ hitting the top of their expectations for 2024 while Hulu is just shy of their bottom expectations, as Disney+ was a hit since its start, with over 10M signups in the first [DAY](https://ibb.co/PW4WRfY).

Disney+ also keeps expanding into multiple countries, as they continued to launch the streaming business in over 15 [countries](https://ibb.co/Kwk9dd1) just recently in November, as their streaming services are [offered](https://ibb.co/4N8s3yt) on most devices like Android & Apple devices, Amazon‚Äôs Fire TV, Roku streaming platform and Google‚Äôs devices.

The company has extreme pricing power due to their capability to generate revenues from their other income streams but haven‚Äôt chosen to abuse that with only minor increases in price while also offering a great Disney [Bundle](https://ibb.co/R2p28zM) for just $13/month that includes the top 3 streaming services, Disney+, Hulu & ESPN+.

Hulu has seen a huge subscriber [growth](https://ibb.co/XkVCK72) in the past years, adding around 8M subscribers/year since 2017 as they offer multiple subscription [choices](https://ibb.co/sFnV4gV), starting from 6$ up to 71$ for their no ads & live TV service. After these results, Disney has slightly increased their bottom-line expectations for the [service](https://ibb.co/4sK1HR7) to 50M by 2024 and are expecting Hulu to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/W3C6Ybm) as soon as FY 2023.

They also revised the [ESPN+](https://ibb.co/S0wx121) expectations from between 8-12M to an incredible 20-30M subscribers range by 2024 as they also expect this service to become [profitable](https://ibb.co/4S8Qj8b) by FY 2023.

But guys, by far, the biggest [guidance](https://ibb.co/3swTzSG) upgrade for Disney has come from Disney+, with a revised guidance of over 230M and a top expectation of 260M subscribers by 2024, which is 30% more than Netflix has right now, after over 20 years since it was founded. They are also planning on [pricing](https://ibb.co/zZszZWR) Disney+ at $8/month starting this March, as they have revised the content [expense](https://ibb.co/kKK2Rxq) to over $8B for 2024, more than double their previous estimates, as they look to provide as much and as good as possible content for their customers.

Despite the huge number of subscribers, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/1Lrscqx) is still losing money due to very high costs of getting the service of the ground, but the company has revised their expectations and expect peak operating losses from Disney+ to come up this year and are expecting profitability by 2024, which is pretty much on schedule.

So, let‚Äôs go a little through the latest quarterly & yearly results for [Disney](https://ibb.co/x3n4Bmb). The company has been hugely affected due to the events that happened in 2020, as they were forced to close or operate at a significant reduced capacity their Parks, Experiences and Products segment. The company reported a non-GAAP loss of $0.20 for the 4th quarter and a loss of $2.02 for the year. Despite this loss I think the company has done as good as was possibly expected, as the situation accelerate their growth of their Disney+ service.

The company [reported](https://ibb.co/Bjpz16L) just over $7B in Media revenues for the 4th quarter and over $28B for the year, both of them being increases of at least 11% vs the previous year. Disney also reported a 41% increase in Direct-to-Consumer revenues for the 4th quarter with almost $17B in revenues for the year, while on the other hand both the Studio Entertainment & the Park, Experiences & Products segment saw a major loss of revenues, with both of them being down more than 50% for the 4th quarter vs 2019.

[Disney](https://ibb.co/G0KBJQG) also improved their operating results in both Media Networks and Direct-to-Consumer but only manage to obtain an operating income from their Media Networks and their Studio Entertainment business, totaling an operating income of just over $8B for the year, a 45% decrease over 2019.

Their latest moves to accelerate the growth of Disney+ had a big effect in the operating [results](https://ibb.co/t3wfwzC), as the costs of rolling out Disney+ eat up the revenues, while very few of their Movies were actually released to the cinema, which also impacted their Studio Entertainment top & bottom line. Also, to be noted that the eliminations segment includes the inter-segment transaction between their Media & Studio segments to their Direct-to-Consumer segment.

[Disney](https://ibb.co/SxXHZLK) also saw their Parks & Experiences revenues decline drastically as well as their operating results as a result of the closing or operating at a reduced capacity for all of their resorts, which is estimated to have had a negative impact of $2.4B for their operating income.

Studio Entertainment was hit just as bad with a decline of more than 50% in both revenues and operating income as theatrical releases were mostly put on pause as most of the theaters around the world have been closed or have operated at a significantly reduced capacity.

We also saw Direct-to-Consumer operating loss and revenues [improve](https://ibb.co/G7Sg19n) for the 4th quarter, as ESPN+ & Hulu were a boost while Disney+ continued to burn money at a very high rate, that is needed for a rapid growth of the service.

We can also see that all 3 major streaming services had a big increase year/year, with ESPN & HULU gaining more than 7M paid subscribers while Disney skyrocketed to over 86M after the latest numbers from their investors meeting. Despite this numbers the only increase in monthly revenue/subscriber was seen in [Hulu's](https://ibb.co/LzmrvwV) top package while the rest of them dropped, very likely due to the high number of promotions in the Asian markets.

It‚Äôs also to be noted that though most of their parks & resorts were affected, Disney didn‚Äôt stop investing in them and had a [Capex](https://ibb.co/2jsth35) of over $4B in 2020.

The [company](https://ibb.co/dk88L7f) also received other sources of income due to their gains in DraftKings, but most of these gains were offset by their interest expenses.

So, you should now that I am bull on Disney but I am willing to hear other opinions so don‚Äôt be afraid to leave a comment down below!

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest [plans](https://ibb.co/9WxkCyd) announced by them and used some estimates and expectations of their revenues streams to normalize in the next years. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research and so on‚Ä¶

So, let‚Äôs start with the Unleveraged discounted free cash flow [projections](https://ibb.co/mtb7s5y), though this is not my favorite type of projections we will get to that very soon.

I implied the same growth rates for the total revenues based on my growth projections and also implied that EBITDA margin will slowly recover to the levels it stood before the massive investments in their streaming business, as the EBITDA margins [stood](https://ibb.co/Svr8NjN) at over 30% before that, and with streaming business being a very lucrative affair I can easily see that happen again.

I also used the Depreciation & Amortization from 2020 and implied a 10% growth, while also doing the same for the Net Working Capital. I used a 15% capex increases like I will do in my growth projections, and used a 9% discount rate, which is above the avg SP500 return in the past 60years.

Now there are 2 methods of doing the valuation, either the perpetuity method or the EBITDA multiple method, but for Disney I think the EBITDA approach is better suited as I expect the stock to be re-rated after they start to turn profitable on their streaming business and you will see with my growth method that it shows pretty much the same results.

So, this means we have an estimated $56B worth of FCF for a 9% discount rate. I also assumed the company will continue to grow at a 3.5% rate after 2025, and that would mean that Disney will be worth almost $500B by 2025. So, let‚Äôs do the math for the growth approach and with a share count of 1.81B, that would mean a stock price of $175 and would imply a return of just over 2%. But I don‚Äôt expect this to be the best way to value the company. I think the EBITDA approach is better suited for the growth that lies ahead for the company. So, I wanted to be conservative and used only a 16 times EBITDA, which is the last multiple Disney traded before 2020, though I think with this new approach to the business we can see Disney valued at even higher multiples, maybe even 20 to 25. So, with this 16 times multiple, the stock would be undervalued by over 40% right now, but for safety reasons I would use an average of the 2 approaches. So, I expect [Disney](https://ibb.co/hM8mqnd) to trade around 210$ using the DCF model, which would imply a 22% return, which seems pretty good.

I think now is the time we move on to my favorite valuation [approach](https://ibb.co/jkL0JG9) for the future.

I like to value companies based on multiples of future price earnings. So, let‚Äôs take a look at what Disney earnings/share will be by 2025.

For my [projections](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c/edit#gid=1003936878) I actually just used their full year results and implied different growth rates for each revenue stream. So, for the Media Networks I implied a 10% increase for next year and a decreasing growth after that and did pretty much the same for the Studio Entertainment Business. I did however imply a return to normal in Parks & Experiences revenues by 2022 and a slowing growth after that, while for the Direct-to-Consumer I implied a bigger growth rate as by their own forecast, Disney+ should account for around $20B in revenues by 2025 on its own.

For Disney‚Äôs cost of sales, I maintained the 68% expense ratio on their Media Networks, while for their Parks & Experiences I implied a very big cost of sales for the next 2 years and expect that to normalize towards the end of the period. Meanwhile for the Studio Entertainment business I actually used a bigger expense ratio just to be safe and for the Direct-to-Consumer cost of sales I implied a loss for 2021, a break even for 2022 and just starting to become positive after 2023 ending with a cost ratio of 75% in 2025. For the eliminations revenues and costs I implied a gradual 10% decrease in each year, but this shouldn‚Äôt affect the results that much in the end.

I used their Capex spending from 2020 and implied a 15% annual growth, as this will continue to increase at least for the next couple of years, while for the interest income & expenses I implied a 10% annual decrease, but this numbers are again so small that they don‚Äôt impact the end result that much, and didn‚Äôt want to assume and other significant losses or income.

I used the nominal US TAX rate of 21% and implied a .5% dilution of the stock each year.

So, let take a [recap](https://ibb.co/nj7sX5h), I expect Disney to have over $137B in revenues in 2025 and almost $35B in gross revenues. After subtracting their $8B capex and the almost $700M related to interest, and also account for the tax rate, Disney should have just over $20B in income after tax or just over $11 in earnings/share. So, adjusted for the .5% dilution, this would mean the stock is trading at just over 15 times price to 2025 earnings right now.

I know Disney has traded under a PE of 20 historically, but with them renouncing dividends and focusing on growth, especially as I can see every streaming business being valued very highly right now, I think we can see a multiple expansion on Disney vs the previous normal. So, depending on what PE you assume for the stock between 20 and 35, the stock can trade between $220 and almost $390.

So, after all these estimates what are my price targets? [Here](https://ibb.co/849LJH3) are my actual price targets‚Ä¶ I think the bear case 2025 price we can see Disney trade at is $249 which would imply a return of over 45%, while my base case and my pretty safe assumption is that Disney will trade at 304$/share by the end of 2025, implying a 77% return on the current price. But my most bullish case would see the company trading at $359, which would imply a return of 110%. So yeah guys, this are my Overall price targets for 2025, my bear case is an average of the 20 & 25 PE ratio, while the normal case is the average between the 25 and 30 PE‚Äôs with the most bullish case valuing the company between a PE of 30-35.

So here is the [FULL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c) spreadsheet that I have projected for Disney by 2025, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Disney has had just in the past year in the past. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/BP8SVHK) in value by more 18% despite all the obstacles it has faced and was up 57% in the 4 years [before](https://ibb.co/bHxHf5h) 2020. So yes, I think Disney will be one of the best re-opening plays and stay-at-home trades as well, so a win-win no matter what.

The company also has very good [financials](https://ibb.co/JntSMr8), with more than $35B in current assets vs only $26B in current liabilities and with over $200B in total assets. So, the company is way more than solvable at any point in the near future, even after the bad year they had in 2020.

And let‚Äôs also take a look at what the estimates are from the analysts. We can see that the [analysts](https://ibb.co/1sRqCTB) expect somewhat smaller revenues by 2025, of around $115B compared to $137B that my Growth Valuations are projecting. But I think this haven‚Äôt been revised enough and don‚Äôt take into account fully what the streaming business will mean for them even after their other revenue streams come back to normal.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Disney?

Let‚Äôs look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/cTCvdgf), Disney has had a history of gapping up and then filling back the gap-up in the past 6 months with the stock doing so 2 times. But more recently they didn‚Äôt fill the gap-up after the vaccine news and even gapped even higher than that after the revised subscribers‚Äô numbers revealed at the investors day. The stock was almost overbought and overbought for pretty long stretches of times in the last 6 months, but right now the RSI has dropped to 51, which could be a sign the stock is ready to move up once again. So, my personal opinion is that we can see the stock trade flat or even drop a little more but not below 158$ before the next quarterly [earnings](https://ibb.co/k8x6cCW) are released in February. Last time around they beat expectations by quite a lot and I think they might actually pull it off again with the increasing strength in the streaming business, and that might be enough to push the stock even higher. So, using the [DCF](https://ibb.co/ZfcJZz9) valuation, I think we can see Disney trading at around $210 by the end of the year, especially if things start to get back to normal and their parks & other revenues streams come back at increased strength.

And let‚Äôs take a quick look at what 27 [analysts](https://ibb.co/VJNg2m5) on Wall Street are saying. They are mostly very bullish on the company with an average price target of $181 and a high price target of $220, as 20 of the 27 analysts are either bullish or very bullish on Disney. So yet again, I think the analyst are undershooting the price of Disney, as it‚Äôs always better to undershoot and overperform rather than the other way around.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Disney stock and I believe it still has plenty of room to grow, so I would start building a position on any weakness, and I would especially buy more if the stock drops to $160.

One last thing to mention about Disney is that they also have a very big % of their shares held by institutions, with over 65% of the float being held by big [funds](https://ibb.co/5KRGT0Y) like Vanguard & Blackrock.

So, this are my projections and my expectations for the company, I think Bob [Chapek](https://ibb.co/1JJzyq2) has done a terrific job since becoming the CEO early in 2020, and has driven Disney to a renewed approach to their business, so, if you do want to check out the spreadsheets you can find the link [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bp9cIUB8s-VZSaBbQHw1IYI3zO9CIWsegPb_xmKHZ4c)!

427,Bloomberg: The US stock market could be headed for a lost decade,1604278298.0,"""When the history of the modern financial era is written, there‚Äôs one comment that‚Äôs almost certain to merit inclusion: ‚ÄúStocks only go up!‚Äù

Sports-blogger turned day-trader Dave Portnoy‚Äôs pithy observation this summer was designed to both amuse and provoke. But if you‚Äôve put money into U.S. stocks since the market bottomed out in 2009, the chances are you think Portnoy is basically correct.¬†Plenty of professional asset managers would concur.¬†

Perhaps the most important question for those considering investing savings today, when stocks are by some metrics among the most expensive they‚Äôve ever been, is whether Portnoy‚Äôs philosophy is about to be turned on its head. In other words: ‚Äúwhat if stocks don‚Äôt always go up?‚Äù

There are reasons to think this fantastic period for the U.S. stock market might soon be followed by a prolonged hangover, possibly lasting a decade or more. Such a stretch of disappointing equity returns would have profound implications for millennials and generation Z.¬†The standard advice around financial planning and retirement saving that‚Äôs worked so well lately ‚Äî¬†put your money in an index fund that tracks the market and forget about it ‚Äî¬†might no longer work so well.

In the past decade, investors who bought an index fund that mirrors¬†the S&P 500 Index and reinvested dividends have enjoyed a 13%¬†average annual return, according to Bloomberg data.

Even a deadly global pandemic that‚Äôs triggered a deep¬†recession and widespread unemployment only briefly interrupted the ascendancy of U.S. stocks. The Federal Reserve rode to the rescue once more, and the S&P 500 hit fresh record highs (though lately investors have since grown cautious again).
Young investors¬†may conclude that bumper returns are all but guaranteed in the years ahead. If only steadily rising stock prices were always the case.
Consider the FTSE 100, an index of some of Britain‚Äôs preeminent pharmaceutical, energy, mining and consumer goods companies. In price terms (ignoring the impact of reinvesting dividends for a second), the U.K. benchmark is lower now than it was two decades ago. It‚Äôs not alone.

The Stoxx Europe 600 benchmark also remains beneath its dot-com-era peak while the MSCI emerging markets index topped out in 2007 and has yet to recover. The market that really refutes Portnoy‚Äôs assertion though is Japan: The Nikkei 225 index remains about 40% below its 1989 peak, when a massive financial bubble burst.

""Stocks Only Go Up""?

Following a financial bubble Japanese investors suffered years of poor returns

Could the U.S. market face a similar fate? There‚Äôve been bleak periods before, most famously in the two decades that followed the 1929¬†Wall Street crash.

Long Hangover

U.S. stocks took a long time to recover from the 1929 Wall Street crash

As recently as 2012 the S&P 500 was below its 2000 peak. Value-orientated asset managers like GMO‚Äôs Jeremy Grantham think¬†something similar could happen again, but it‚Äôs not just well-known Cassandras who worry. Hedge fund¬†billionaire Ray Dalio¬†of Bridgewater Associates and Blackstone‚Äôs vice chairman Tony James¬†have both warned about a¬†‚Äúlost decade‚Äù¬†for equity investors.¬†

If you‚Äôd followed GMO‚Äôs advice in 2013 to steer clear of American large-cap stocks and load up on emerging market shares, you‚Äôd have missed out on seven years of stellar returns.¬†So what‚Äôs different now?
1. Extreme valuations
Equity¬†valuations have grown even more extreme. During the pandemic, they have become completely divorced from economic fundamentals thanks to the Federal Reserve‚Äôs largess.¬†A stock market bubble pulls forward expected returns from the future, setting investors up for probable disappointment later on. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs exactly when past returns are most glorious that future prospects are most dismal,‚Äù investor John Hussman, another famously bearish investment manager¬†wrote recently. He‚Äôs described today‚Äôs menu of choices for passive, long-term investors as¬†‚Äúthe worst in history.‚Äù

Expensive Stocks

U.S stock valuations aren't at dotcom era levels, but they're certainly not cheap

The CAPE ratio uses a ten-year average of inflation-adjusted earnings to smooth out short-term noise

2. Ultra-low interest rates
Low interest rates are often portrayed as bullish for stocks because¬†they boost the value of future corporate cash flows in today‚Äôs money and reduce the cost of servicing¬†debt. But with U.S. short-term¬†rates now at zero, the Federal Reserve may find it harder to juice the stock market. Ultra-low rates also reflect pessimism about future economic prospects. ‚ÄúWhen real rates are low, future returns on equities and bonds tend to be lower rather than higher,‚Äù Elroy Dimson, Paul Marsh and Mike Staunton wrote in Credit Suisse‚Äôs¬†2020¬†compendium of past market returns. ‚ÄúInvestors should assume a sober view of the likely excess returns equities can generate from here.‚Äù
3. Profit margin reversion
A key determinant of equity returns, profit margins have been unusually high over the past couple of decades. But corporate profits have now suffered a massive hit due to the pandemic. Even without the virus, those oversize¬†earnings should eventually dwindle as competitors spy an opportunity. Monopoly power may hinder this, but dominant tech companies are¬†starting to face more competition¬†and stricter antitrust enforcement. Globalization is also¬†in retreat and workers are demanding are a fairer split of the rewards of capitalism.
4. An aging population
This is often considered a key reason for Japan‚Äôs prolonged stock market slump.¬†Although the U.S. is aging less rapidly, the demographic changes underway are bound to have an impact on future equity returns. An aging population may be less productive, lowering potential economic growth. Furthermore, by 2030 the large and asset-rich U.S. baby boomer generation will all be over the age of 65, and they may need to cut their exposure to risky stocks or sell financial assets to fund their retirement, weighing on prices.

While this all sounds bleak, it‚Äôs some comfort that over the very long term stocks have tended to go up. In nominal terms, one dollar invested in the U.S. market in 1900 was worth $58,000 by 2019, according to the Credit Suisse market returns study, or an annualized 6.5% return when adjusted for inflation.¬†In the meantime, there are a few things young investors can do¬†to avoid being caught out by a duff decade for U.S. stocks.
For starters, if returns are lower I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll also need to save more to build wealth. Consider adding some exposure to non-U.S. equities, which may at last be due a period of outperformance relative to the U.S. And by reinvesting dividends you can still obtain decent returns even if stock prices go nowhere. (The FTSE 100 has fallen 19% since the turn of the millennium, but investors who reinvested dividends received a 63% return in that period.)
Hopefully, the gloomy scenario I‚Äôve painted won‚Äôt materialize and U.S. companies will develop new technologies that power the economy and the stock market to new heights in the next decade. But if that doesn‚Äôt happen, you‚Äôll be prepared.""

436,SEC Filings: What you need to know,1609095738.0,"**SEC FILINGS**

Form 8-k

This form is used to report newsworthy events to the SEC, thereby making them available to the public. Included are items such as change in management, change In the company‚Äôs name, mergers or acquisitions, bankruptcy filings, and major new product introductions or sale of a product line. A Form 8-K HAS to be filed when a member of the board of directors resign over a disagreement. The 8-K is filed within four business days of the occurrence. This form is used only by domestic issuers, foreign issuers are exempt. Although ADR‚Äôs are registered with the SEC, they too are exempt because of the underlying security of foreign issue.

Form 10-K

Most domestic public issuers must file an annual report to the SEC on FORM 10-K. This report is a comprehensive overview of the company‚Äôs business and financial condition and includes financial statements that have been audited by an independent accountant. Do not confute this with the annual report to shareholders, which also contains and audited financial information than the annual report, while the annual report will have much more detail about the company itself and its future plans.

The Filing Deadlines depend upon the company‚Äôs public float. For Companies with a float of $700million or more, the Form 10-K deadline is 60-days after the close of the fiscal year; $75 million, but not $700 million, it is 75 days; and less than $75 million is due at 90 days.

Form 10-Q

Because one year between filings is a long time and a lot can happen quickly, we also have this form, and it is filed quarterly (Q for quarterly). It contains unaudited financial statements and for all but the companies with a public float of less than $75 million, it must be filed within 40 days of each of the first three fiscal quarters of the year (no 10-Q is filed at the end of the fourth quarter‚Äîthat information is taken care of by the filing of the 10-K). Those smaller firms file theirs within 45 days of the end of the quarter.

Annual Reports

When it comes to publicly traded companies, in general, all shareholders must receive a copy of the issuer‚Äôs annual report. For those too lazy to access EDGAR, this is the most detailed information they can get on the company‚Äôs financial position. Unlike the Form 10-K, this is usually a professionally prepared piece with just as much used for marketing purposes as it is for providing information. There is usually a welcoming letter from the CEO/Chairman of the board, and it is generally loaded with beautiful pictures of smiling people (employees and customers) and the company‚Äôs facilities. New plans for products and programs are discussed and voting proxies are included.

Form S-1

SEC Form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the SEC for public companies that are based in the U.S. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. Companies usually file SEC Form S-1 in anticipation of their initial public offering (IPO). Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition and provide a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities.

SEC Form S-1 is also known as the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933. Additionally, the SEC requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue.

Foreign issuers of securities in the U.S. don‚Äôt use SEC Form S-1 but instead must submit an SEC Form F-1.

Form S-3

SEC Form S-3 is a regulatory filing that provides simplified reporting for issuers of registered securities.

An S-3 filing is utilized when a company wishes to raise capital, usually as a secondary offering after an initial public offering has already occurred.

In order to utilize the simplified process, firms must first meet a certain set of eligibility criteria.The SEC form S-3 is sometimes filed after an initial public offering (IPO) and is generally filed concurrently with common stock or preferred stock offerings.

There are a variety of other requirements that must be met for a business to file the S-3 form. In the 12 months prior to filling out the form, a company must have met all debt and dividend requirements. The SEC Act of 1933 also requires that these forms be filed to ensure that essential facts about the business are disclosed upon the company‚Äôs registration of securities. Doing so allows the SEC to provide investors with specifics about the securities being offered and works to eliminate fraudulent sales of such securities.

Form 4

SEC Form 4: Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders consist of directors and officers of the company, as well as any shareholders, owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock. The forms ask about the reporting person's relationship to the company and about purchases and sales of such equity shares.Form 4 must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders .If a party fails to disclose required information on a Form 4, civil or criminal actions could result. It must be filed within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred.

Schedule 13D

The Schedule 13D is also known as the ""beneficial ownership report"" and is required when any owner acquires 5% or more of the voting shares in a company. The report must be filed within 10 days of reaching the 5% threshold. It provides the following information: The acquirer's name, address and other background information, Type of relationship this owner has with the company, Whether the person has been convicted of a crime in the past five years. An explanation of why the transaction is taking place, The type and class of the security, and The origin of funds used for purchases.

Form 144

Form 144 is required when corporate insiders want to dispose of company stock. The Form 144 is a notice of the intent to sell restricted stock, typically acquired by insiders or affiliates in a transaction not involving a public offering. The stock is restricted because it must meet certain conditions before becoming transferable. The transaction, or at least part of it, is made within 90 days of filing. Form 144 is required when the amount sold during any three-month period exceeds 5,000 shares or $50,000.

Initial Public Offering (IPO)

A corporation‚Äôs first sale of common stock to the public.

Secondary Offering

A Sale of Securities in which one or more major stockholders in a company sell all or a large portion of their holdings; the underwriting proceeds ae paid to the stockholders rather than to the corporation. Typically, such an offering occurs when the founder of a business (and perhaps some of the original financial backers) determine that there is more to be gained by going public than by staying private. The offering does not increase the number of shares of stock outstanding.

Regulation D (Private placements continued.)

The provision of the Securities Act of 1933 that exempts from registration offerings sold in private placements. Rule 506(b) limits the Sale to a maximum of 35 NON-accredited investors during a 12-month period with no advertising permitted, while Rule 506(c) permits advertising but requires that all purchasers be accredited investors.  


Accredited Investor - As defined by Rule 501 of Regulation D, any institution or individual meeting minimum net worth requirements for the purchase of securities qualifying under the regulation d registration exemption. An individual accredited investor is generally accepted to be one who, individually or with spouse, has a net wort, excluding the net equity in the primary residence, of $1 million or more, or has had an annual income of $200,000 or more in each of the two most recent years (or $300,000 jointly with a spouse), and who has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current year.   


SEC Rule Change Effective 12/08/2020 -- Individuals who hold the Series 7, Series 65, or Series 82 Licenses, are now considered accredited investors by qualification.

##Financial markets have got out of whack with the economy. Something has to give

STOCK MARKET HISTORY is packed with drama: the 1929 crash; Black Monday in 1987, when share prices lost 20% in a day; the dotcom mania in 1999. With such precedents, nothing should come as a surprise, but the past eight weeks have been remarkable, nonetheless. A gut-wrenching sell-off in shares has been followed by a delirious rally in America. Between February 19th and March 23rd, the S&P 500 index lost a third of its value. With barely a pause it has since rocketed, recovering more than half its loss. The catalyst was news that the Federal Reserve would buy corporate bonds, helping big firms finance their debts. Investors shifted from panic to optimism without missing a beat.

This rosy view from Wall Street should make you uneasy (see article). It contrasts with markets elsewhere. Shares in Britain and continental Europe, for example, have recovered more sluggishly. And it is a world away from life on Main Street. Even as the lockdown eases in America, the blow to jobs has been savage, with unemployment rising from 4% to about 16%, the highest rate since records began in 1948. While big firms‚Äô shares soar and they get help from the Fed, small businesses are struggling to get cash from Uncle Sam.

Wounds from the financial crisis of 2007-09 are being reopened. ‚ÄúThis is the second time we‚Äôve bailed their asses out,‚Äù grumbled Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, last month. The battle over who pays for the fiscal burdens of the pandemic is just beginning. On the present trajectory, a backlash against big business is likely.

Start with events in the markets. Much of the improved mood is because of the Fed, which has acted more dramatically than other central banks, buying up assets on an unimagined scale. It is committed to purchasing even more corporate debt, including high-yield ‚Äújunk‚Äù bonds. The market for new issues of corporate bonds, which froze in February, has reopened in spectacular style. Companies have issued $560bn of bonds in the past six weeks, double the normal level. Even beached cruise-line firms have been able to raise cash, albeit at a high price. A cascade of bankruptcies at big firms has been forestalled. The central bank has, in effect, backstopped the cashflow of America Inc. The stockmarket has taken the hint and climbed.

The Fed has little choice‚Äîa run on the corporate-bond market would worsen a deep recession. Investors have cheered it on by piling into shares. They have nowhere else good to put their cash. Government-bond yields are barely positive in America. They are negative in Japan and much of Europe. You are guaranteed to lose money by holding them to maturity, and if inflation rises the losses would be painful. So stocks are appealing. By late March prices had fallen by enough to tempt the braver sort. They steeled themselves with the observation that much of the stockmarket‚Äôs value is tied to profits that will be made long after the covid-19 slump has given way to recovery.

Tellingly, though, the recent rise in share prices has been uneven. Even before the pandemic the market was lopsided, and it has become more so. Bourses in Britain and continental Europe, chock-full of troubled industries like carmaking, banking and energy, have lagged behind, and there are renewed jitters over the single currency (see article). In America investors have put even more faith in a tiny group of tech darlings‚ÄîAlphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft‚Äîwhich now make up a fifth of the S&P 500 index. There is little euphoria, just a despairing reach for the handful of businesses judged to be all-weather survivors.

At one level, this makes good sense. Asset managers have to put money to work as best they can. But there is something wrong with how fast stock prices have moved and where they have got back to. American shares are now higher than they were in August. This would seem to imply that commerce and the broader economy can get back to business as usual. There are countless threats to such a prospect, but three stand out.

The first is the risk of an aftershock. It is entirely possible that there will be a second wave of infections. And there are also the consequences of a steep recession to contend with‚ÄîAmerican GDP is expected to drop by about 10% in the second quarter compared with a year earlier. Many individual bosses hope that ruthless cost-cutting can help protect their margins and pay down the debts accumulated through the furlough. But in aggregate this corporate austerity will depress demand. The likely outcome is a 90% economy, running far below normal levels.

A second hazard to reckon with is fraud. Extended booms tend to encourage shifty behaviour, and the expansion before the covid crash was the longest on record. Years of cheap money and financial engineering mean that accounting shenanigans may now be laid bare. Already there have been two notable scandals in Asia in recent weeks, at Luckin Coffee, a Chinese Starbucks wannabe, and Hin Leong, a Singaporean energy trader that has been hiding giant losses (see article). A big fraud or corporate collapse in America could rock the markets‚Äô confidence, much as the demise of Enron shredded investors‚Äô nerves in 2001 and Lehman Brothers led the stockmarket down in 2008.

The most overlooked risk is of a political backlash. The slump will hurt smaller firms and leave the bigger corporate survivors in a stronger position, increasing the concentration of some industries that was already a problem before the pandemic. A crisis demands sacrifice and will leave behind a big bill. The clamour for payback will only grow louder if big business has hogged more than its share of the subsidies on offer. It is easy to imagine windfall taxes on bailed-out industries, or a sharp reversal of the steady drop in the statutory federal corporate-tax rate, which fell to 21% in 2017 after President Donald Trump‚Äôs tax reforms, from a long-term average of well over 30%. Some Democrats want to limit mergers and stop firms returning cash to their owners.

For now, equity investors judge that the Fed has their back. But the mood of the markets can shift suddenly, as an extraordinary couple of months has proved. A one-month bear market scarcely seems enough time to absorb all the possible bad news from the pandemic and the huge uncertainty it has created. This stock market drama has a few more acts yet.‚ñ†",2020-05-08 08:59:05

458,"The pros are getting ready for a market crash ‚Äî retail investors, not so much, top economist warns",1599039274.0,"***‚ÄòA large market correction, should one materialise, would encourage more professional selling that could overwhelm the buy-the-dip retail investor.‚Äô***

That‚Äôs **Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz‚Äôs chief economic adviser**, explaining in [an op-ed for the Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/e50812f0-51c1-4f8c-9072-21eb0eb8cb9d) how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market‚Äôs relentless push higher in recent months.

‚ÄúThe seemingly endless rally‚Ä¶ gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAfter all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. ‚Äú

However, ‚Äúsophisticated investors‚Äù are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note.

‚ÄúIt is hard to overstate the extent of today‚Äôs risk-taking in U.S. financial markets,‚Äù he wrote, pointing to the explosive moves in a small number of high-flyers, such as Apple [**AAPL,** **+3.98%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AAPL?mod=MW_story_quote), Tesla [**TSLA,** **-4.67%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TSLA?mod=MW_story_quote) and Amazon [**AMZN,** **+1.39%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMZN?mod=MW_story_quote).

‚ÄúMuch of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,‚Äù he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it‚Äôs looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars.

‚ÄúRather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors‚Äô resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIt is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.‚Äù

On the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we‚Äôre seeing in the derivatives market, but there‚Äôs more to it than just that.

‚ÄúThe fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,‚Äù El-Erian said. ‚ÄúThose who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong ‚Äòbuy-the-dip‚Äô conditioning that comes with that.‚Äù

He pointed out that buying call options limits risk and gives traders the ability to take strategic shots at capturing rallies. At the same time, the smart money is hedging bets with downside ‚Äútail protection‚Äù to guard against the inevitable sharp declines. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre seeing the VIX volatility gauge [**VIX,** **-1.09%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/VIX?mod=MW_story_quote) decouple from equities, another sign, according to El-Erian, that retail investors are particularly vulnerable when the sellers take the upper hand.

Stocks hit record levels again today despite disappointing data on job creation in November. The DOW and S&P 500 each hit a record-high intraday, led by energy and financial stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 0.8% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.84%, and the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.41% up.

Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Pfizer (PFE) is experiencing supply chain issues that could result in only half of the estimated vaccines entering distribution. Pfizer, along with partner BioNTech (BNTX) announced plans to ship 50 million vaccines by year-end, half of the 100 million doses previously expected. The company says it still anticipates delivering over 1 billion doses by the end of 2021.

Today, the Labor Department released their November jobs report, which showed the slowest pace of job growth since April‚Äôs record spike in unemployment. Non-farm payrolls grew by just 245,000, much lower than the 460,000 expected. The deceleration in recovery is likely due to the record spike in infections this month and the reimposition of certain restrictions across the United States. However, it is important to note that recent job data has surprised to the upside. The weekly unemployment reported released yesterday showed the first drop in new unemployment claims in three weeks.

As market participants and economist upgrade their estimates for 2021, many believe that cyclical and rotation stocks, like energy, financial, and reopening stocks,  that were hardest hit by the pandemic will extend gains into next year. Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual said, ‚ÄúAs you move into 2021, there will be broader economic growth, it will be more inclusive, you will see continued fiscal stimulus ‚Äì I do believe we will get a package.

California Governor Gavin Newsom announced he would impose extremely strict stay-at-home orders when intensive care units reach less than 15% availability, which he expects to happen soon. The stay-at-home restrictions will begin with 48 hours‚Äô notice and remain in place for at least three weeks once they are ordered. Gov. Newsom said, ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt act now, our hospital system will be overwhelmed. If we don‚Äôt act now, we will continue to see the death rate climb,‚Äù

Ring, the video-doorbell company that Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.38%   bought Tuesday for more than $1 billion, was rejected by a panel of investors on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúShark Tank‚Äù in 2013.

Jamie Siminoff, the founder and chief executive of Ring ‚Äî then called DoorBot ‚Äî went on the show seeking investors for his nascent business. Pitching it as ‚Äúcaller ID for your door,‚Äù Siminoff was seeking $700,000 for a 10% stake in the company ‚Äî a $7 million valuation.

No one bit, except for investor Kevin O‚ÄôLeary, who offered a $700,000 loan, 10% of all sales until the loan was paid off, 7% royalties on all future sales and a 5% stake in the company.

Those terms didn‚Äôt work for Siminoff, who walked away from the offer.

**TL;DR**

The first milestone prediction is wrong.  The Indian stock market continued to rise despite an extension of the lockdown and growing infections.  It did not fall back to 7800-8000 as predicted.

**How do you feel now?**

Whilst I still stand by the thesis and we still have 5.5 months for the prediction to expire it is looking more and more like the Federal Reserve expansion of credit facilities and junk buying will maintain the asset values.  At present, credit providers are likely to get paid twice (once by stimulus going to consumers to pay off bills and then again by purchasing of defaulted debts later on).

**How are your bets down?**

I didn't hedge and the primary losses were sustained in the drop in the Vix to today's monthly low.  I also left some positions open overnight and they didn't decline on negative news but did increase wildly on positive sentiment.

**Were any of the commenters right?**

The original post had a ton of valuable and respectful discussion and was fun to write.

Another use disagreed and he has turned out to be absolutely correct.  Praise to u/green9206 and I owe him a beer.

Several posters did comment that the Federal Reserve are likely to be successful.

**Have any financial personalities blown your thesis away?**

Well, yes.  In particular  [https://twitter.com/DiMartinoBooth/status/1250066951281532932?s=20](https://twitter.com/DiMartinoBooth/status/1250066951281532932?s=20) who quotes that  predicts stocks hit all-time highs w/i year & that investors who fight new & improved Fed will get burned to a crisp as they‚Äôve been assured they‚Äôll be made whole by JaPo.

**Why did you write such a long and intense post?**

Good question.  Mainly for the enjoyment.  It forced me to be bold in my own predictions.  It forced me to confront my own biases and it also forced a greater understanding of financial theory.  Also, the comments forced me to admit the gaps in my ideas and it was a good thing to invest time in.

**What do you think will happen next?**

Honestly.  I have no fucking idea.  I comforted by the sheer amount of hedge fund managers, investors and analysts on Twitter saying the same thing.  We are living through unprecedented, wildly volatile times.

Despite today‚Äôs slight decline, major indexes are set to cap off November with historic gains, with the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 averaging around 10% gains in the month. The Dow also recently broke 30,000 points briefly, which many market participants see as a major benchmark. 

This morning, Moderna (MRNA) announced it filed for emergency use authorization with the Food and Drug Administration in the US and European Medicines Agency for its coronavirus vaccine candidate. ‚ÄúWe believe that we have a vaccine that is very highly efficacious. We now have the data to prove it,"" Moderna Chief Medical Officer Dr. Tal Zaks said in a telephone interview. ""We expect to be playing a major part in turning around this pandemic."" Moderna‚Äôs announcements follows Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) also filed for emergency use authorization with European and American health officials. Both vaccines use a technology called synthetic messenger RNA and have around a 95% rate of effectiveness. 

The steady stream of positive vaccine news and Biden‚Äôs appointment of Janet Yellen as new Treasury Secretary have largely been seen as a market positive. And moreover, the murky situation surround the Presidential Election in the US is beginning to clear up, with the General Services Administration (GSA) formally recognizing Joe Biden‚Äôs win. Trump has yet to concede but admitted he would leave the White House if the Electoral College voted for Joe Biden.

Despite countless calls from health officials and politicians to stay home for Thanksgiving. According to the Transportation and Security Administration (TSA), around 7-10 million people traveled in an airplane in the week of Thanksgiving, most likely to visit family members. As a result, the surge in coronavirus infections, hospitalizations. There are nearly 100,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, by far a record high and around a 50% increase since the start of November. Thankfully, after reporting a record-high 205,000 new cases on Friday, cases have fallen to 136,000 yesterday. Still, health officials are warning that hospital systems across the are becoming increasingly strained.

486,Stock market crash 2021 or growth ahead? | Jobless claims impact on the stock market | STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-06],1607307856.0,"**The latest jobless numbers came in bad while the stock market keeps pushing forward, is a stock market crash coming soon? Let‚Äôs talk about this and the latest stock market news**

Hey everyone! So let‚Äôs start with the recap off Friday as we saw the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HD8WbDT) leading the way up 0,88%, with the [DOW Industrial](https://ibb.co/sCt0FJj) close behind up 0,83% and the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/dDhWbBG) also gaining a decent amount, up 0,7% with all 3 big indexes closing at all-time highs.

We saw more than ¬æ of the [stocks](https://ibb.co/CB6cSMn) advancing despite below average volume as companies either small, mid or large cap value or growth [stocks](https://ibb.co/qCNqN5G) were gaining except large-cap growth. 

The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/d6f58Mf) were Energy and Materials up over 2% while Utilities finished 1% down on Friday, as Utilities were the only sector to finish the week losing significant ground, with Consumer Discretionary also dropping just 0,12%. With the rest of the sectors in the green, Energy, Health Care, Technology and Communication being the biggest gainers finishing the week up over 2%.

[Utilities](https://ibb.co/Bz8TnvP) have been hit hard in the last year as residential consumers and small businesses have been able to defer paying power bills, this will continue to hold down the sector for now with the debt still increasing.

The VIX also dropped more than 2% on [Friday](https://ibb.co/18qjBx7) and finished the [week](https://ibb.co/7KyfPxQ) over 5% down as the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/sKhhfx6) from Friday shows us that there were plenty of gains to be made especially in the Energy Sectors as well as Financials, with the big companies from the Tech and Communication sectors doing worse than the rest of the market.

For the week though this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/92hRtQL) shows that Apple was one of the biggest gainers alongside Semiconductors and Energy Names while Health Care companies like JNJ and Pfizer also did very good.

The big indexes all finished higher for the [week](https://ibb.co/b3Gb4HN) with the SP500 up 1,7%, the Nasdaq Composite up 2,1% and the Dow up 1% with renewed hopes for a stimulus package being back on the table.

Here are the most interesting economic [reports](https://ibb.co/j84CkLT) for next week, it will be a light week in terms of economic data but still, the market may be volatile and trends may change depending on some of the results.

So, on Friday [November JOBS](https://ibb.co/r0JPtCs) came in much lower than anticipated, coming in at 245K vs de 610K in October and 469K estimated while the unemployment [rate](https://ibb.co/M9mNBMT) dropped to 6,7% a bit better than expected and down from 6,9% in the past month. Still there are over 10million people unemployed, this number more than doubling since the start on February. The [net addition](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) of jobs in November was the [smallest](https://ibb.co/dWKmZWH) since May as government jobs were the [worst performing](https://ibb.co/F54hcKb) while transportation and warehousing jobs continue to increase, as big companies ‚Ä¶ aka Amazon has hired almost 3thousand people per day this year. But the bad news is that [long-term](https://ibb.co/HFZFhyC) unemployment is approaching the peaks from the Great Recession and that is not good news for the economy or the stock market as over 3,9 million people have been out of work for at least 6 months. 

So, this is pretty bad news as mortgages in [forbearance](https://ibb.co/NLcDmYP) just slightly declined this week, by just 39K with more and more plans planned to expire in December, over 1M more exactly, more than 40% of active cases.

This may finally put some extra pressure on the Congress to agree to a relief package maybe even passing it alongside the government [funding bill](https://ibb.co/1qkTnsD) that is still debated and has over 300 issues that the parties don‚Äôt agree on. 

This is becoming more and more obvious as [cases](https://ibb.co/6y9FTjV) in the US continue to rise, coming in over 200k in the last 2 days and the economy will soon feel the pressure from this, I expect the next month or two of economic data to not be so good, this may be the time the market sees a 5-10% correction before moving on higher on more positive things like the availability of the vaccine, the passing of the torch In the Presidency and a possible relief package.

Yes, this will continue to add to the [US DEBT](https://ibb.co/QjSPcdB), but even though I don‚Äôt have any partisan views, a good structured relief bill would do wonders for the economy as a bridge to when the vaccine will finally be widely available.

Yes, I know that the global debt is set to reach $200 trillion but the DEBT-to-GDP [ratio](https://ibb.co/LhWkxKJ) is projected to slowly go back down in the next couple of years.

Other numbers that came in on Friday were [Factory ORDERS](https://ibb.co/xm7JJ2Q) which came in better than expected at +1%. While a new Redfin report indicates an increase in [average home prices](https://ibb.co/pXYNGcz) year over year of 16% with the number of pending home [sales up](https://ibb.co/2nw00m3) almost 30% over last year while new listings of home sales is [up just 9%](https://ibb.co/v3nyLPZ) since 2019 and dropping rather fast in the last months with sales of homes going for all time-high [prices](https://ibb.co/gmvRPd7) at 99,5% of the asking price as the real estate market keeps booming along.

The other number that came in on Friday and was not so good was the [trade deficit](https://ibb.co/42nsy2W), which widened even more in the last month by almost $2B.

So next week is again pretty slow in [earnings reports](https://ibb.co/Xkr4f4P) with the most interesting ones on being Chewy, GameStop, Adobe, LuluLemon, Dave&Busters, Costco, Oracle and Broadcom.

I own a small stake in all of them except Oracle and GameStop. I don‚Äôt see such a big growth opportunity with Oracle while GameStop I believe will struggle to turn around the business with very though e-commerce competition.

We will also have a number of new [IPOs](https://ibb.co/0jQWwTf) this week from DoorDash, AirBNB, C3.ai, Hydrofarm and Pubmatic. The first 3 are more interesting for myself but I will only take a first look at AirBNB and at what price that stock goes public to maybe get some action, I think we will a much bigger price than the 44-50$ price range to begin with for public trading. I also expect the same thing to happen with DoorDash which has already raised the IPO [pricing](https://ibb.co/Y8VSCpV) to 90-95$ but I am not very interested to buy that stock, as this type of economy has hugely benefited them and it might see a decrease rather than an increase in the next couple of years.

So, guys I still believe the stock market has upside in front of it, especially in the next 2 years, but you should tread careful for now, I think a possible correction might be just ahead before we move on higher, as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/9g0bJdj), a wedge formation is continuing to from with more and more tension, I believe there is about a 6,5% possible downside to the market at the moment before eventually getting back on track next year and going toward the 4000 level. And especially with the most recent jobless numbers in the US, I would try to diversify a little more especially with some EAST-ASIA exposure in countries like South Korea, Singapore and China also.

491,Why the market is rising in the early cycle of a pandemic (my thoughts),1587281543.0,"# Why the market is rising in the early cycle of a pandemic

It really bothers me when I don‚Äôt understand something; what drives me insane is when something happens that is the exact opposite of what I think should be happening.¬† The current divergence between the US stock market and the economy is one such conundrum.  Judging by the conversations I‚Äôve been having lately with some really smart people, it feels like I‚Äôm not the only one.

Why is the market rising?

Yesterday I had some really cool conversations with Arvind Ravishunkar and Craig Weinstein that brought us to a potential answer; one that now makes me think that what is happening is actually rational.¬† I have no idea if our theories are correct; I just thought they were interesting enough to write it down and share it and potentially get a discussion going.

These are just ideas that I hope help any of you as it helped me.

So, what‚Äôs actually going on?¬† The US equities market S&P500 index hit a closing high on February 19th 2020 of 3,386.15.¬† At one point on March 23rd, it had dropped to 2237.  Why did the market drop so far so quickly? I believe it was because the shutdown of the world economy, and specifically the US economy, put the possibilities of mass bankruptcies on the table due to a potential liquidity crisis. This realization that the equity value of billion dollar companies across industries in oil and gas, retail, banking, and many others could go to zero in a matter of weeks led to an unprecedented flight from the stocks of these companies.¬† It made total sense why investors were scared.  Most enterprise companies in the S&P500 require continuous liquidity, I.e. access to short term debt, to run day to day operations.  If demand-side shocks cause revenue to go close to zero (stay-at-home orders), then they would need access to cash fast to cover fixed expenses, debt payments, and critical operational expenses.  The amount of cash available through traditional bank and debt (bond) channels would be unable to serve the trillions needed, which means these enterprise companies would be out of business due to the lack of oxygen (cash).¬†¬†

That‚Äôs when the FED did something even more unprecedented than the pandemic itself, they came out and provided huge amounts (trillions) of liquidity, and essentially bankrolled the economy at a scale that has never been done before.¬† They also didn‚Äôt discriminate, and decided to provide liquidity to everyone that could have a contagion impact; banks, mortgage backed securities, high grade corporate debt, low grade corporate debt, and Main Street lending.  The low grade corporate debt was the real signal that no matter what happens the Federal reserve would allow no company to fail due to lack of liquidity.¬† It was with this statement, that no company would fail due to lack of liquidity, that made the market make the following statement.

‚ÄúWith bankruptcies off the table, and the Fed showing an unlimited appetite to provide liquidity for an undetermined amount of time, then investors could take a longer look out at the economy, potentially even 18 months out, and take the chance that most companies will be around to service demand when it returns in mid 2021.‚Äù

Essentially, the market is willing to dismiss the earnings of the next 12 months, and look at earnings 18-24 months out. Since there seems to be no short term impact to an eventual 10-15 Trillion Fed balance sheet, it made more sense to park money in equities than it was to put money into short and long term debt that will average a 1% return.¬† This happened even though the Feds actions are deflationary, because it keeps supply (businesses producing more) at a growth level higher than demand (consumers who want to spend).¬†

At the same time, the Fed also bought up the debt of the US Government, ensuring that interest rates remain close to zero so that the US government can continue to service its own increasing deficit, and increased dollar-swap lines so emerging markets could do the same.

So what are the risks that could drive the US equity market down from here?

1. Any uncertainty that the Fed has changed its position and that unlimited liquidity is off the table.¬† That would mean that debt liquidity could evaporate, leaving companies back to going to zero.
2. That the only market bigger than the debt market, the FX market, changes direction and decides that they don‚Äôt want to service their debt in dollars, and the counter parties agree. Then the Fed would lose control of interest rates, as the demand for dollars plummets, forcing an increase in interest rates to raise the demand for dollars.
3. Demand (from consumers) remains structurally depressed past 12 months.

\#3 is really interesting here, because I think #1 and #2 have a low probability.¬† During an election year, there is no way Trump will turn off the debt spigot, and if Biden wins, he wont have the political capital to do it either.¬† For #2, I think this **will** happen, but closer to 2026, when debt levels accelerate worldwide towards 1000% of GDP (rather than the 300-600% it is today).

So if #3 happens, I think the Fed will move directly to lending to the consumer.¬† Opening up term loans to consumers would of course put all banks out of business, so they would do this by buying consumer debt directly from the banks.¬† This would drive the cost (interest rate) of revolving credit down to the single digits, allowing consumers to load up on debt faster than ever before, spurring an unprecedented period of growth.¬† It is this that will eventually lead to scenario #2, because as the world debts level topple themselves over, they will have no choice but to abandon their dollar-denominated debt, which then would contagion into hyperinflation into the USA, which the Fed would be powerless to stop.

So, that‚Äôs what we‚Äôve come up with.¬† It is perfectly rational for the US equity market to rise because of the fact that the market has a) no place to earn a higher return to put trillions of investable cash to work and b) the feds actions have taken the risk to zero off the table, allowing investors the ability to ignore the next 12 months and focus on the next 18-24 months, keeping businesses afloat while demand has time to come back to February 2020 levels.",2020-04-19 00:32:23

[Smart Mirror Product Action Shot](https://imgur.com/a/ZNJri3r)

$CAPC is a debt-free penny stock exempt company currently trading on the higher-tier OTCQB markets with audited financials and fully SEC reporting.

During last week's conference call, CEO confirmed that Smart Mirrors will begin shipping in June on Capstone's website and **will be available on Amazon.** The company confirmed that the Smart Mirror will be in big box retailers in second half of 2021. Capstone products currently sell in major retailers like Costco, Home Depot, Walmart, Target and more. It's amazon reviews for it's previous products are 5-stars. They know how to build a quality product that sells.

[Tweet from Capstone Companies, Inc.](https://imgur.com/a/ur3npx5)

The number of outstanding shares is just under 50M with the company directors owning nearly half of the shares, leaving a float of 24M. Directors have never sold a share over company's history - zero dilution. In fact they added 400K worth of shares in the last couple of months in the open market with plans to buy another 750K shares through August. This company believes in the product.

This will easily appreciate in value once revenues from Smart Mirror are realized. This company is primed for growth and the corporation is already preparing for possible uplisting to NASDAQ.

Beyond this, the Smart Mirrors are just cool - people want them and the price point for $CAPC mirrors is huge for what it offers. Only $699 starting price means it is affordable for the average person, and you can mirror your phone and engage with the mirror just like you would a tablet or touch-screen PC. I think this product blows $LULU mirror out of the water as far as functionality and price point.

Their offer of vaporizers is fascinating as well: desktop vaporizers, portable vaporizers and so on. The company had a bad reputation in the past. There was a stereotype, that everyonedoesit was scamming their customers. **And then it was purchased by Namaste Technologies a couple of years ago.** Since then everyonedoesit could attract a lof of weed lovers and leaving them satisfied.

502,Warren Buffett and the Stock Market Crash,1588719731.0,"Warren Buffett made headlines recently after his recent [virtual Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69rm13iUUgE).

Buffett sold of all his shares in the major US airlines, and Berkshire announced a record quarterly net loss of nearly $50BN. Berkshire *had* held sizeable positions (around 10%) in the major US airlines.

As well as this, Buffett also allowed Berkshire's cash stake to rise to a record $137.3BN from $128BN at the end of 2019.

Clearly, as he is selling at a significant loss, Buffett believes that there is further pain ahead for the airlines. 

The GOAT is not one to fall for the sunk cost fallacy...

Moreover, his cash position indicates that he doesn't believe that we have reached the stock market bottom yet, although he wouldn't give specifics.

Others however are more explicitly bearish.

The numbers are certainly [not looking good](https://fortune.com/2020/03/20/recession-us-gdp-negative-growth-q2-predictions/)...

**TRUTH 1/2:**

[1640 CEOs left their posts in 2019](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/2019-had-the-most-ceo-departures-on-record-with-more-than-1600.html), the highest year on record since tracking began in 2002.

For context, there were 1484 exits in *2008* when the country was embroiled in the financial crisis.

This trend has continued in 2020, [in January a record 219 CEOs left their posts](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/rapid-ceo-turnover-continues-with-a-record-number-of-top-executives-departing-in-january.html), the highest month on record.

The economy was going to crash anyway. It was inevitable.

However, they were afraid of massive protests against corporate greed, massive social unrest, etc so they needed a diversion that would provide an excuse.

People will think the crash was solely due to the virus and not the numerous fundamental economic and structural issues at play.

To highlight just a few: we've had the [yield curve inversion](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/yield-curve-inversion-explained-what-it-is-what-it-means-2019-8/?r=US&IR=T), the [repo madness](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-08/repo-blowup-was-fueled-by-big-banks-and-hedge-funds-bis-says), the [record corporate debt](https://www.businessinsider.de/international/us-corporate-debt-10-trillion-record-percentage-economy-expert-warnings-2019-12/?r=US&IR=T), and [corporations being the main source of demand for equities via stock buybacks](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/business/stock-market-buybacks.html) which enrich executives that hit certain earnings per share targets.

Last year billionaire Peter Thiel, who was part of the notorious Paypal Mafia, [spoke on the dangers of American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JRyy2MM-rI). He argues that this has made America ""exceptionally un-self-critical""

Warren Buffett concluded in his virtual meeting: ""Never bet against America""

In other words, never bet against the military industrial complex to enforce American superiority and the power of the dollar as the de facto unit of exchange globally.

**TRUTH 2/2:**

As smart contracts pioneer Nick Szabo has stated:

""Buffett's wealth can be measured less in present cash than in the future cash from the Fed he is right up there at the front of the Cantillon line to get.""

[The Cantillon Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv5xl1AEeQs) essentially refers to the fact that fiat printing itself increases inequality. 

On a more general note, it is important to remember that, despite his gentle image, Buffett is ruthless in his craft. 

A [New York magazine profile from 1991](https://books.google.de/books?id=veTPZA9TWxsC&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=1991+new+york+magazine+warren+buffett+Warren+looks+like+a+teddy+bear,+but+mentally+is+he+ever+tough&source=bl&ots=OT8xAOp_-y&sig=ACfU3U2s1_9PvAvkaw4w5BSh0l1KgG1yhA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtvP2__ZzpAhUG3aQKHfcYA1kQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=1991%20new%20york%20magazine%20warren%20buffett%20Warren%20looks%20like%20a%20teddy%20bear%2C%20but%20mentally%20is%20he%20ever%20tough&f=false) stated: 

""Though he appears homey and guileless and cultivates a hayseed image, Buffett can be iron-fisted.""

According to a senior Salomon trader: ""Warren looks like a teddy bear, but mentally is he ever tough.""

Yes, Buffett has dropped numerous gems throughout the years, but ultimately his responsibility is to Berkshire Hathaway and his own, sizeable, bags.

Overall, it would be foolish to overlook Buffett's current cash position.

When everything is dirt cheap and we do eventually hit the bottom, he will be flush with cash and ready to aggressively sweep up bargains. 

At the moment, it is clear that he believes these bargains are not present, and therefore it would be wise to consider the fact that we may have further downside in store...

503,Palantir Adds $17 Billion in Value in Best Week Since Debut,1606777368.0," Palantir Technologies Inc. posted its best week since it went public in September, adding about $17 billion in market value as a broad rally in tech stocks helped fuel gains in the software maker.

Its shares rose 52% since Monday and touched a fresh intraday record at $33.50. The stock lost some of the gains on Friday after Citron Research said in a tweet it was shorting the stock with a $20 target. The company ended the session at $27.66.

Palantir representatives didn‚Äôt respond to a request for comment.

‚ÄúA lot of institutions have probably warmed up to the company and are viewing it as something to hold onto for the long term,‚Äù said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a great software company, and it has a terrific business, a very sticky business, not just with governments but also enterprises.‚Äù

Trading in Palantir options also surged this week with average daily volume of call contracts jumping about 250% in the first three days of the week when compared to the prior week. An analysis of open interest shows most of the contracts being opened and closed in the same day, indicating a heavy presence of day traders.

After an initial lackluster performance following its direct-listing stock debut, gains for the Denver-based firm, which sells data-analysis tools, have accelerated after hedge funds, including Steve Cohen‚Äôs Point72 Asset Management, reported purchasing the company‚Äôs shares.

‚ÄúBig-data companies have become very important and historically have been excellent stocks. Also, Palantir is benefiting from the pandemic -- tracking cases and analyzing data is right in its wheelhouse,‚Äù Kaufman said.

Since starting up in 2003, co-founder and chairman Peter Thiel has helped bankroll the business throughout its long period as a closely held business. Now, the stock has gained nearly 300% since its direct listing. It reported third-quarter losses in its first financial results since going public as compensation costs surged. It did, however, boost its revenue growth forecast for the year to 44%, exceeding the amount analysts expected on average.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd say the days of it trading below $20 are probably over,‚Äù Kaufman added.

It doesn't matter what you think TSLA's valuation is because as long as Musk is running it it will continue to succeed IMO. Why? because of things like this:

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-taps-market-rally-keg-145407552.html

Tesla did the same thing back in February, almost immediately after the stock hit $1000/share, and then priced the offering at $767 to raise $2 billion. A few months before that people were afraid they were going to have to file bankruptcy, but with that offering they rescued themselves and gleaned the cash they needed to keep going. Now, after a 5:1 split and another MASSIVE run to pre-split prices of almost $2.5k, ol musky boy files a $5 billion shelf which basically means they can now sell up to 5 billion in shares whenever they want. You better believe that a big chunk of this will be sold in the near future, and they will raise billions in cash at these ridiculous valuations. 

Musk is the definition of a capitalist and if you think TSLA is going down any time soon well ... you're gonna have a bad time. Offerings can push it down in the short term, but long term a TSLA with $5 billion more in cash is WAY stronger than the current TSLA.",2020-09-01 16:28:02

U.S. stock markets have been in rally-mode this week, as Wall Street grows more optimistic about the economy reopening, despite uncertainty over the coronavirus pandemic and growing tensions between the U.S. and China.

The [Dow Jones Industrial Average](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-30) closed above 25,000 for the first time since March on Wednesday, while the [S&P 500](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500) topped the 3,000-mark, putting it back above its 200-day moving average ‚Äì a key level watched by traders.

The easing of lockdowns, optimism about an eventual COVID-19 vaccine and massive U.S. stimulus have powered a recent stock market rally.

The Dow, S&P (NYSE:[SPY](https://www.investing.com/etfs/spdr-s-p-500)) and [Nasdaq](https://www.investing.com/indices/nasdaq-composite) are up 40.2%, 38.5% and 41.9% respectively above their March 23 lows.

 The impressive recovery rally has propelled Wall Street‚Äôs main averages back towards their respective all-time highs reached earlier this year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index just 4.3% away from its record peak. 

The bulls have had the upper hand in recent weeks, however that could change should the war of words between Washington and Beijing escalate further.

That could be the catalysts to take the market lower, bringing the correction most are expecting to come.

508,How have the WHALES behaved? I aggregated and summarized institutional holdings data and price performance data from some of the biggest tech names over the last 5 years,1599553872.0,"*Disclaimer: I'm a geek and love data. Prepare yourselves for geekery. All data is sourced from SEC 13-F filings, and note that these figures are estimates and may differ significantly due to the recent large moves in tech stocks. For the most part the calculations should be accurate but because institutional ownership is relative to market cap, it can be skewed if there's a big change in stock price compared to the point the holdings data was reported. I've tried to ensure the market cap comparison is current, but it can still be a bit fucky due to the fact that the holdings data is from Q2 and Q3 hasn't been fully reported yet (for example TSLA market cap at the time of the 13F filings for Q2 was $200ish billion, so 97B in holdings represents 48% ownership. The value of those holdings should increase proportionately to the share price so theoretically if you extrapolate it out to today, it should be the same (96.11 million shares * 5 for the split) * 418.32 last close = $201 billion / current market cap of approx $400 billion, yadda yadda ... it's close enough). It's also possible I'm just dumb and my calculations are wrong, so take this w/ a grain of salt and please point out any errors you see! K. Onward, noble gentry.*

So for something I was working on for my personal website I wanted to create some new little code snippets that would aggregate and display various stats on price performance and institutional holdings. Watching institutional holdings has led to some interesting discoveries in the past, not the least of which is the recent one that [SoftBank basically went balls out and goosed the nasdaq like a WSB YOLO'er](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-nasdaq-whale-may-have-triggered-the-stock-markets-brutal-rout-claims-report-11599234572).

Since I just finished these little snippets to aggregate this data, I decided to put them to use and check out how institutions as a whole have behaved over the last several years. I don't know if this really provides any interesting findings, but I'll share my thoughts along the way I guess and you can all argue and tell me I'm wrong/stupid/whatever ... it's the internet - have at it. Here's what I found: 

#AAPL:

Apple's institutional holdings have been pretty static over the last five years, increasing only about 2.47% over that time period. Whales seem to pretty much stick around 58-62% ownership in AAPL. That didn't stop that ownership from increasing over half a trillion bucks in value though, increasing from a value of $425 billion in 2015 to $931 billion in 2020. Over that time, Apple's share price has appreciated 330% from $28 to $120 (split adjusted). Summary: https://i.imgur.com/JhkdjnV.png (Note that shares for institutional ownership are pre-split, so multiply the share numbers by 4 to get current holdings. The percentages don't change) What I find interesting about AAPL is that as a whole, institutions actually decreased their holdings over the last three months (by 137M shares/548M post split) and still ""made"" $276B thanks to the massive tech rally (note I say ""made"" because this isn't profit, per say, it's an increase in the value of their holdings, which obviously (hopefully? lol) they're not going to dump, but it's still interesting to me!) Ok anyway - onto the next:

#AMZN:

Amazon has seen institutions decrease their holdings about 10% over the last five years. Compared to Apple's increase of 2.47% this is a pretty drastic difference, but still the whales hold 287.43 million shares of AMZN worth almost $800 billion, or about 57.47% of the company. Over that time, the value of their holdings has appreciated over $654B despite their decreasing stake, thanks to AMZN's colossal 536.59% return over that time period. AMZN's institutional holdings also decreased over the last three months, like AAPL's, but still increased in value over $230 billion or about 41.45% over that time, compared to the price appreciation in AMZN of only 30.53%. Does that mean they ""beat"" the market? Maybe I'm misinterpreting that data but that's what it seems to suggest to me. Maybe I'm retarded, please share your thoughts there. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/v9Hpccy.png

#MSFT:

Microsoft is similar to AAPL in that their institutional holdings seem to hover around the same level. It's about 70% owned by institutions and has hovered between 70-75% over the last five years. MSFT has appreciated 388% during that time, while the value of whale holdings has increased from $255B to over $1T (323%). I dunno about you guys, but my portfolio hasn't increased $824 billion in the last five years. Pretty wild. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/dp4YyjW.png

#FB:

Facebook is the first one we're looking at with a significant INCREASE in institutional holdings over the last five years, as whales have increased their stake about 10.42% from 54.85% to the current 65.27%. Over that same time period, Facebook stock has appreciated 215%, taking the value of their holdings from $132B to $422B, an increase of about 219% which is pretty much in line w/ the market. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/UPFiXY4.png

#NFLX:

Whales have been unloading Netflix over the last five years, down about 6% over that time period, but NFLX has by far the highest institutional ownership level of any we've looked at so far, at over 80% of the company valued at $161 billion. Over the last five years the value of these holdings has increased from $34 billion to $161 billion, an increase of 373% vs the stock's appreciation of 443.5%. Summary: https://i.imgur.com/CFX0Bmw.png

#GOOGL:

Google is another pretty boring one IMO. It's about 66% owned by whales, a level which has stayed pretty static over the last five years. It's only dropped about 2.5% over that time. Institutions seem to be pretty chill holding onto GOOGL and just maintaining their investment. Over that time the value of these holdings has gone from $251B to $637B as the stock increased 145% from $643 to its current price. Here's the summary: https://i.imgur.com/gd9t0nS.png

And last but not least ... 

#TSLA:

I found this one the most interesting (I mean really what did we expect lol). Over the last five years institutions have decreased their stake by 13.75%, and 8.56% of that was in the last 12 months. Total institutional ownership right now hovers around 48%, which is worth about $97 billion (96 million pre-split shares, so about 500 million now). What I find most interesting about TSLA is that even though institutional ownership has decreased about 2% in the last three months, as a whole, institutions added about 2.53 million TSLA shares which means the reason that their percentage has decreased is related to the change in TSLA's market cap. I'm not an expert but I suspect this has something to do with the retard-strength rally of 120% over the last 3 months, or maybe the fact that TSLA has gone from a split-adjusted $49 to $418, a whopping 742% increase over the last five years. Here's the summary for that: https://i.imgur.com/Isjf9Gl.png

Alright that's enough for now. I'll do more of these if people like them. Like I said I don't know if this really yields any interesting info but my takeaways from it are pretty straightforward:

1) Whales are unloading TSLA, AMZN, and NFLX on average over the last 5 years, but they own a ton of NFLX relative to the others I looked at

2) Whales are loading the boat on FB. Long FB calls or somethin, I dunno

3) Whales are pretty static on GOOGL, AAPL and MSFT.

4) I'm poor and whales are rich",2020-09-08 01:31:12

I don't know anybody personally who invests in ETFs/Indexes that track the Dow. But they do get decent volume.

To me, I feel the Dow is like my grand dad's stocks. There are some good names, but it's mostly old names. I usually only use it as a reference to see how the old American companies are doing.

513,Biden wins | nVidia stock |NetFlix stock |Buffet‚Äôs stock moves & more [11-8-2020],1604886047.0,"**Biden wins the election, what does this mean for the economy and the stock market, what Buffen‚Äôs Berkshire has done in the last quarter and more, let‚Äôs talk about everything** 

Hey everyone and welcome, I am going to react to the latest news from the election, the economy and in the stock market from last week and what to expect next

So late Saturday the victory of Biden was announced as networks finally started to predict that he won the election. I have no partisan view as i am not a resident or citizen of the US, but i believe that the results of this election (the Biden win and the Republicans keeping the Senate) is the best the stock market could have hoped for, as many experts were predicting a Blue Sweep. There still will be two important runoff elections in Georgia at the beggining of 2021, where the Democrats could still end up winning the Senate. Biden currently has a projected 290 electoras votes but i believe he will also keep the lead in Georgia and end up with 306 electoral votes, the same number as Trump had 4 years ago [VOTE MAP](https://ibb.co/LZ5dnzt) . Important leaders like the German Chancellor, Uk‚Äôs prime minister, Canada‚Äôs prime minister, France‚Äôs president and many more welcomed and congratuled the win of Biden, which seems to be favored internationaly by the world leaders as they were tired of the whipsaw that came with Trump tweeting non-stop. So this probable grid-lock in Congress is loved by the stock market, as there are no iminent tax raises and a stimulus bill is far more likely if not by the end of the Trump mandate surely at the very start of Biden‚Äôs.

So this scenario that is playing out seems to be the most profitable one for wall street as the average annual return since 1933 is about 14% with a Democractic President and a split Congress [Historical CHART](https://ibb.co/SJGP97P)

Yesterday Biden also announced how they will try to combat the illness with Better testing and tracing, a increase in PPE production, National guidance for schools, business and families, Investments of 25 bilion in vaccine development and distribution and mask mandates. While also trying to make the higher risk individuals more safe.

So all 3 big indices had the best week since early April with the Nasdaq composite being up just over 9% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/rpgWtJH), the SP500 was up 7,32% [S&P CHART](https://ibb.co/Ss7FWVN) and the DOW gained almost 7%.[DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/j3bB0P8) The Nasdaq and Sp were flat for the day, pairing loses from the begining of the day while the down fell 0,23% mostly based on profit taking in my opinion.

There were more companies that were declining on Friday with over 60% of the companies in the red but with a disproportional number of almost 90% of new highs while the volume fell again way below average [MARKET CHART](https://ibb.co/k0kY7Z1) .

The market should now turn they‚Äôre attention to the samshing of the earnings season amid the election with 2 thirds of the SP500 beating the estimates both the top and bottom line, that is almost double the 38% historical average. 

Bank of American release a chart for q3 earnings and as you can see earnings have increased 6,7% in the SP500 year over year and 21,5% quarter over quarter. [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/C6zfWZR)

And as the fed announced that it will keep the benchmark rate between 0 and 0,25% [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/vjNy43D)this continues to stimulate the economy of the US, with the fed beeing probably more responsible for the recovery in the last months as stimulus has been staled in congress. Also they continue to have a target of a running inflation of 2% and will continue to buy assests worth around 120 billion dollars montly to pump money in the economy  [FED NEWS](https://ibb.co/wBxn56S). If a stimulus bill will eventualy pass, households will probably continue to use the money the same way as last time with over 70% of the money being used for savings and debt payments. But thay may go down a little as people may tend to spend a little more on essentials and non essentials with a better outlook in the near future than last time.

Here are some interesting economic events for next weeks as we continue to closely watch how to recovery is going. [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/gMX5XH5)

Nvidia saw a pop in the stock finally as they announced that Fornite will join the GeForce gaming cliud, that could mean a return for the game in ios devices with GeForce currently available on Mac,Windows,Android and Chromebooks.

Buffets Berkshire announced on Saturday that they bought back around 9 billion of the company‚Äôs stock,bringing the total to around 16 bilion for the year so far.[BUYBACK CHART](https://ibb.co/ysw5bkx) That was around 4 billion more than in the second quarter. the operating earnings also decrease a little since last quarter and are almost 3 billion or 32% less then last year. [BUYBACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/fSWCvdQ)The only segment that improved since last year was Railroad,utilities and enegery, while insurance was the biggest loser.

The company has almost the same amount of cash and short term investemtns like the previos quarter at around 146 billion dollars with 70% of the investments concentrated in 4 big companies (Apple , Bank of America, Coca-Cola and American Express) up from the 60% these company represented at the end of 2019. [INVESTMENTS](https://ibb.co/Dps2f95)

The buybacks of the company exced any full year amount in Berkhsire‚Äôs history and far exeded the analysts expectation of around 3,2 billion in buybacks. As the strategy for Buffet and Charlie Munger is to buyback the company‚Äôs stock as long as they believe it‚Äôs undervalued and they will still have ample cash after the buybacks. AS the only other major investments made last quarter were about 6 billion invested in the five big Japenese trading houses and the data storage company Snowflake.

I just saw some interesting news as NetFlix announced they will launch a offering named NetFlix Direct in France that will come with a linear feed of content from Netflix‚Äôs library, so the company that is the biggest reasons for the decline of old TV programming made quite a twist as they seek to expand more and more.

that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,

For those that believe in NKLA I think you should show proof. Do some screenshots and show the shares or calls/long you are doing. The calls are insanely cheap right now so would be no reason, even if you want to play safe with the stock you get a great buy in price right?

So if you really believe in NKLA and stand by it like you are saying than do what others are doing and showing that believe it is not a great company or maybe something much worse by taking up short positions and posting the details of it.

Stocks continued rising today, with each of the major indices hitting fresh intraday record, before selling off somewhat in the last hour of the market. Market participants are eager to extend gains after a historic November performance. The Dow posted its biggest monthly gain since January 1987 with an advance of nearly 11.9%. In the S&P 500, the energy, financials, and industrials sectors led the index‚Äôs 10.8% rise, as market participants rotated back into many of the names that had been beaten down the hardest earlier on during the pandemic in the wake of positive vaccine news.

The positive vaccine news led analysts to raise their predictions for 2021 after Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and AstraZeneca (AZN) each reported promising vaccine data in their clinical trial, raising hopes that an effective solution to the pandemic could roll out relatively soon. Fundstrat Managing Partner Tom Lee said in a note Monday he believed the S&P 500 would end 2020 at 3,800, implying another nearly 5% upside for the index. However, given the surge of coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe, Jerome Powell tempered optimism. He said, ‚ÄúRecent news on the vaccine front is very positive for the medium term. For now, significant challenges and uncertainties remain, including timing, production and distribution, and efficacy across different groups.

According to Worldometer, as of Tuesday, there are 13,919,870 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. According to the same chart, 274,332 people have died from the virus in the U.S., and 8,222,879 have recovered so far. In the month of November alone, the US added more than 4 million cases, double the amount from October, according to the Johns Hopkins University. There were around 168,000 new cases reported Tuesday, with health officials expecting worse to come given the travel that took place during Thanksgiving in the US.

**Highlights**

* Zoom (ZM) reported way better-than-expected earnings but the market was not impressed, stock down more than 15% at the time of writing.
   * EPS of $0.99 vs $0.75 estimate 
   * Revenue of $777.2 million vs. $694.5 million estimate. Revenue is up 366.5% on a year-over-year basis.
* Zoom (ZM) rated by many reputable analysts as NEUTRAL or EQUAL-WEIGHT with price target very close to current levels. Seems analysts not expecting much from Zoom after earnings.
* U.S. airlines could receive $17 billion for four months of payroll support under a new $908 billion bipartisan Senate COVID-19 relief proposal, a spokeswoman for Senator Mark Warner said Tuesday. We‚Äôll keep you posted if there are any developments.

550,Deep dive into the technological aspect of Intel's problems,1597091172.0," Since   its‚Äô Q2 earnings call a few weeks ago, Intel Corporation (INTC) shares   have plummeted 20% upon announcement of problems with its‚Äô   next-generation 10nm and 7nm manufacturing processes. The massive   collapse has led to widespread attention among investors, but in reality   the situation has been years in the making for those who‚Äôve been  paying  attention. Today I‚Äôd like to look at some of the technical  decisions  Intel made, why they‚Äôve caused problems and the implications  of that on  their future.

**Lithography techniques**

Lithography   is an incredibly complicated process that forms an incredible   competitive advantage for those who master it. In simple terms, you put a   template of circuit designs (photomask) on a silicon base (wafer) and   shine a powerful laser on it [\[1\]](http://www.lithoguru.com/scientist/lithobasics.html).

Over   time, people tried to fit more transistors in the same area ‚Äì this   would lead to increased performance capability, lower power consumption   and various other benefits outlined in Dennard Scaling\[2\]. This becomes   progressively more difficult over time, as you‚Äôre trying to cram   transistors into areas thousands of times smaller than the width of a   hair. The industry ran into a particularly tricky wall around the 20nm   mark, since the size of the laser you used to ‚Äòprint‚Äô the circuit design   became so relatively big that it couldn‚Äôt reliably follow the   complicated patterns needed for all the transistors. Two schools of   thought developed to address this problem ‚Äì patterning (using more than   one photomask, each with simpler diagrams, and lasering the wafer with   each of these templates separately), and EUV (extreme ultra-violet,   using radiation with much smaller wavelengths than traditional). Intel   saw success with dual-patterning (two templates) on its‚Äô 22 and 14nm   process, and chose to go one step further and pursue quad-patterning on   its‚Äô 10nm process.\[3\] Meanwhile, its‚Äô competitors TSMC and Samsung  chose  EUV. \[4\] For reference, Intel themselves have also chosen to  pursue EUV  for their 7nm process. That might give you a hint as to  which was the  right choice‚Ä¶

Other  terminology  I‚Äôll be referring to in this piece are yield (how much of a  wafer is  actually useable) and monolithic (the whole CPU is cut out of  the wafer  as a single piece of silicon) vs chiplets (the CPU is formed  from  several pieces of silicon stuck together)

**The problems with 10nm**

Back   in 2013, Intel was in it‚Äôs prime. It dominated the CPU market with   >90% market share, and was pursuing a tick-tock strategy with its‚Äô   chips ‚Äì every two years you would have a die shrink ‚Äòtick‚Äô, then the   alternating years you would have a microarchitecture change ‚Äòtock‚Äô. In   the roadmaps released by Intel, they planned to have their next ‚Äòtock‚Äô   of 10nm in 2016. The ‚Äòtick‚Äô ‚Äì Skylake architecture came, but the ‚Äòtock‚Äô   never did. Even today, 4 years after it was supposed to be released,   10nm still isn‚Äôt really here. On paper, it was launched with Cannon Lake   in 2018 ‚Äì but the total number of those are in the thousands, if not   hundreds. On paper, the ‚Äòmass-market‚Äô generation Ice Lake launched in   2020 but they have incredibly limited supply and offer inferior   performance to Intel‚Äôs own 14nm offerings. \[5\] The latest update is that   desktop and datacentre chips will come in the second half of 2021 ‚Äì  but  for reasons we shall soon see it is my opinion that these will yet   again be flops. In fact, it is my opinion that 10nm is a total  writeoff,  and that the design decisions taken at a very early stage  have doomed  it to failure.    When you use lithographic techniques, you  are bound to  have some defects in your wafer. After all, creating  billions of  devices tens of atoms in size isn‚Äôt going to be perfect.  Patterning as a  lithographic technique inherently has a higher defect  rate than not  using it ‚Äì you‚Äôre basically going through the same  process multiple  times, thus increasing the chance of defect  dramatically. As I mentioned  earlier, Intel is using quad patterning in  10nm ‚Äì this means their  defect rates are going to be sky high. At the  same time, their usage of a  monolithic die compounds this problem for  high-performance, high core  count CPU models. As you can see from the  blue wafer below, it‚Äôs  difficult to draw large squares (high-core count  models) that are  without defect. In comparison, the red wafer is AMD‚Äôs  chiplet approach,  built on TSMC‚Äôs less defect-prone EUV process.

Since   you can paste together multiple small CPUs into one bigger one, you  use  a far greater percentage of the wafer, cutting costs and letting  you  freely choose however many high-performance chips you want to  build.

Of  course, it‚Äôs impossible  for anyone outside Intel to know the exact  numbers for the defect  rates, yields and unit costs for 10nm. No doubt  they are improving as  time goes on,as they always do with a maturing  architecture. However, I  can say with certainty that

1. they are currently not yielding at rates that could let them release high core-count server chips in any volume, EVEN AT A LOSS
2. The   margins on 10nm will NEVER reach the heights that Intel has   traditionally seen. Intel has enjoyed gross margins of above 60% for the   last decade. In my opinion, if Intel were to replace their whole   product stack with 10nm, their gross margin will never rise above 30%.   The maximum price they can release their products at is capped not only   by AMD‚Äôs offerings, but more importantly their own legacy performance.   If Intel attempted to price at a level that would give them healthy   margins, their entire product lineup would be outcompeted by their 5   year old 14nm chips on a price/performance basis, and their customers   would have no reason to upgrade, decimating their revenues.

These   are bold statements but I believe Intel‚Äôs actions over the past few   years, and their planned actions over the next few, support this view.

When   you release a new generation of processors, you always want to have it   be ‚Äòbetter‚Äô than the previous generation. This may seem incredibly   obvious, but the only exception is when the design has such big inherent   flaws that you can‚Äôt physically do so. For instance, the Bulldozer   architecture AMD released in 2011 performed worse than their own   previous-generation Phenom II architecture \[6\], leading to   near-bankruptcy of the company, due to the flawed design of maximising   core counts from a belief that multi-threaded performance was the   future; while having the processor cores shares caches and FPUs,   massively reducing the multi-threaded performance of the architecture.   Intel finds themselves in a similar situation today. Their design   choices made back in 2013 mean that it is impossible to mass produce   10nm high core count chips. This would‚Äôve been fine if their monopoly   continued and the mainstream continued to have 4 core, 8 threaded CPUs.   Indeed, they are producing Ice Lake laptop CPUs today that have 4  cores.  However, the resurgence of AMD with their high core count  capable Zen  architecture meant that Intel were forced into raising  their own core  counts to compete ‚Äì there has been a doubling of core  counts across  their entire product stack, which is fine on 14nm with  its‚Äô double  patterning, but not so much on 10nm. The limitations of  10nm mean that  current generation chips at the same price point from  Intel have 14nm  massively outperforming 10nm, with the higher core  counts outweighing  any density improvements that 10nm brings.  Similarly, leaks for the  upcoming 10nm Alder Lake desktop and Ice Lake  Xeon chips suggest that  the maximum number of cores on 10nm,28,  will  be 33-50% lower than those  from 14nm \[7\] ‚Äì not to mention AMD‚Äôs  offerings which top out at 2.3x  the core count at half the price.\[8\]  The persistent lack of chips on  10nm that can outperform their  predecessors, despite us now technically  being on ‚Äò10nm+++‚Äô, suggests  that there is a fundamental barrier in the  technology that no amount of  delays and extra engineering can get past.  10nm is rotten from the  very first steps taken.

**7nm and beyond**

So   now we‚Äôve established just how much of a disaster Intel‚Äôs 10nm process   is, what about 7nm? It should be better right? After all, its‚Äô built  on  the superior EUV, rather than SAQP. The market obviously expects it  to  be Intel‚Äôs saviour, given the massive drop in Intel share price was   widely attributed to the ‚Äò6 month delay‚Äô in 7nm rollout. While I don‚Äôt   have nearly as much solid information to go on compared to 10nm, I just   want to note a few things. The exact words Bob Swan used in the Q2  call  were ‚Äòwe are seeing a 6 month shift in 7nm‚Ä¶ 12 months behind our   internal target‚Ä¶ we have identified a defect mode that resulted in yield   degradation‚Äô.

There‚Äôs quite a  lot  to break down here. Many people, including analysts on the call,  were  confused by how 7nm could be both 6 and 12 months behind target at  the  same time. Have Intel achieved quantum tunnelling of time? The  truth is  that Bob‚Äôs claim of a ‚Äòbuffer in planning process‚Äô as the  reason, while  technically true, is incredibly misleading. In any  typical launch of a  new process node, you spend a few months getting up  to speed ‚Äì running  the foundry through the whole process,  troubleshooting, using the  produced chips as prototypes to send to OEM  partners for them to design  products around, etc. You don‚Äôt sell the  chips produced to anyone.  Industry standard is to call this period a  tape-out, not a launch of a  new process ‚Äì that‚Äôs when you actually  produce chips that you sell to  people. Bob‚Äôs comment translated is that  the process is delayed by 12  months, but they‚Äôre going to breach  industry standard and ‚Äòlaunch‚Äô 7nm  when the first fabs start spinning  up 6 months before they have chips in  any volume. Sound ridiculous?  Well, Intel did the exact same thing with  10nm. Faced with mounting  pressure over the constant delays, Intel  ‚Äòlaunched‚Äô Cannon Lake in May  2018. There was 1 CPU in the whole  generation, a dual core processor  with a clock speed of 2.2Ghz that was  slower than the i3-3250 released  in 2013 for $20 less than the 10nm  part. Not to mention it was nigh on  impossible to actually buy one.\[9\]  Cannon Lake was an incredibly  obvious paper launch, released to appease  investors at a time where  Intel had just started up its fabs. Ice Lake,  the first 10nm  architecture you could actually buy (in limited  quantities) shipped in  September 2019, more than a year after Cannon  Lake ‚Äòlaunched‚Äô. This  ‚Äò6-month‚Äô delay is nothing more than an attempt to  sweetcoat a 12 month  delay (assuming no further delays).

The   second part of the comment, relating to a ‚Äòdefect mode‚Äô, is just as   interesting as the first. Intel are attempting to use GaaFeT technology   for their 7nm process, though there's conflicting information  suggesting  they might move away from this if it proves to be too  difficult. \[10\]  GaaFet, or Gates-all-around-Field-effect-Transistor, is  a new and  unproven transistor technology that should overcome the  technical  difficulties current transistor technologies face at  increasingly  smaller sizes. Unlike normal process shrinks, this is  going to a  completely new type of transistor and we only have one other  comparable  in history ‚Äì the transistor to a 3D FinFeT technology a few  years ago.  With FinFet, the research process from having a ‚Äòworking  prototype‚Äô  demonstrating commercialisation potential took 8 years. \[11\]  Meanwhile,  the equivalent demonstration with GaaFeT took place 3 years  ago.

\[12\]  While FinFeT and  GaaFeT are different beasts, it is undeniable that the  plans from  Intel, and indeed all other foundries, are incredibly  ambitious. The  latest leaks suggest that the ‚Äòdefect mode‚Äô Intel have  ran into has to  do with their GaaFeT implementation. If this is true,  you could easily  see 7nm being just as much of a disaster as 10nm is.

Beyond 7nm, there are some positives to be [found.](http://found.as/)   As we get even smaller transistors, it will be necessary for both EUV   and patterning to occur. It's likely that Intel will have an advantage   in this area compared to competitors due to their experience with 10nm.   At the same time, they are actively exploring chipletbased designs.  They  might have been late in realising the benefits, but they've  finally  come around with their EMIB, Foveros and big.Little  technologies, all of  which I'll explore in a future blog post.

**Conclusion**

I‚Äôll   leave it to you to decide what the financial implications of these   deductions are for Intel, but suffice it to say the baseline scenario is   far worse than what many people envision. There is no doubt that Intel   will recover from this fiasco, but at what cost? Will it require yet   another management reshuffle? Following in the footsteps of AMD,   outsourcing production fully and writing off its‚Äô own fabs?   Acknowledgement that they will no longer be able to extract incredible   margins from their monopolistic position?

Stocks traded mostly lower today, losing some of yesterday‚Äôs gains. Market participants are digesting the first batch of corporate earnings, special events from giants Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), and as usual, developments in Washington regarding fiscal stimulus.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished even on the day. The S&P 500 (SPY) 0.64% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.58%.

Economists and financial analysts expect companies within the S&P 500 to post an aggregate earnings per share decline of 19.4% over this year. This estimate is higher than the 20.5% decline predicted back in the Spring. LPL Research said in a note, ‚ÄúThe increase in analysts‚Äô earnings estimates reflects increased confidence in the outlook, even with the challenges Covid-19 still presents in terms of social distancing, various safety protocols, and shifting consumer behavior. We have been encouraged by recent data pointing to a continued steady reopening of the economy, and we believe the likelihood that additional lockdowns may meaningfully impair business activity remains very low.

Today, in a letter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the White House‚Äôs new proposal for coronavirus aid, saying that ‚Äúin terms of addressing testing, tracing and treatment, what the Trump Administration has offered is wholly insufficient.‚Äù After a day of promising developments yesterday, it appears stimulus negotiations have stalled once again. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel said his party was preparing a new, targeted package of ‚Äúroughly $500 billion‚Äù. However, Pelosi has stated in the past, in response to the airline relief bill, that she will not support targeted stimulus, only a comprehensive package. Over the weekend, the Trump administration called on Congress to pass a smaller $1.8 billion coronavirus relief bill as negotiations on a bigger package continue to run into roadblocks.

556,Why GameStop shorting happened,1612477360.0,"First, I am nonpartisan, and politically neutral


For those interested in the GameStop short squeeze; these are my thoughts.


I have been trading stocks for 20 years, a lot over the last six.¬† The stock market is unfair, and designed so the rich keep money; not make, or invest, simply keep.¬† Hedgefunds hold the money for the Uber rich; they move money around rather than add value or produce. Their goal is to stay rich at any cost. The unfair rules make it so you can't even invest in a good company because they can lend your stock, even ""sell"" your stock without you knowing.¬† They will scare you, encourage you, push the price to where they want to sell or buy.¬† This is what GameStop is about.¬†


In 2014, former president Bill Clinton was paid $250,000 by Citadel to speak at New York restaurant Daniel to investors and employees in celebration of the Citadel's founders' 46th birthday. Citadel has paid over $800,000 in speaking fees to current secretary of the treasury Janet Yellen.¬† Before the left gets angry; Trump is an asshole, but they all are rich.


2018, Bloomberg reported that 40% of Robinhood's revenues (a trading platform for the small investor) were derived from selling customer orders to firms such as Citadel Securities. Citadel Securities was fined $700,000 by FINRA in July 2020 for trading ahead of customer orders.


Hedge fund Melvin Capital reportedly lost $4.5 billion in assets value in January 2021 ‚Äì a 53 percent drop ‚Äì after its massive bet that GameStop's stock price will fall turned sour, the Financial Times reported Sunday.


After these losses; Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management invested $2.75 billion in hedge fund Melvin Capital Management on January 25th, 2020.


Without warning, on January 28th, Robinhood restricted all their users from buying GameStop.¬† The stock plummeted from 470$ to 132$, saving Citadel and Melvin Capital billions, at the expense of the thousands of Robinhood investors.


After these events, Jimmy Kimmel suggests Russian disruptors. CNN and CNBC call it a pump and dump.¬† Saying little about the hedgefunds that had a 250% short position on companies that hire people during a pandemic.


Almost 40% of all US currency has been printed in the last 12 months.¬† Billionaires fortunes have increased almost 40% in the last 12 months.¬† Wallstreet bets is about a broken system.¬† Poverty doesn't care about skin color, nationality, political affiliations.¬† The system is broken but people are too focused on things that don't matter.


You can't sell a house you don't own;

You can't sell a car you don't own;

You can sell a stock you don't own... If you are privileged enough.¬† Only a select few get access to that information.


Those who laid down their retirement funds, college savings, hard earned, not inherited money did it for meaningful change.¬† They won! --- until the banks cheated with no accountability.¬† The media and politicians don't cover it and until these discussions happen; tribalism, intolerance from the left, and facism from the right will grow.",2021-02-04 15:22:40

Stocks traded choppily after yesterday‚Äôs selloff, with the indices losing an average of 5% from their October highs. Market participants are closely monitoring the rising number of coronavirus cases in the US and Europe and uncertainty surrounding stimulus and the presidential election a mere week away.

In the US, over the weekend, the US registered coronavirus cases hit a record high with more than 81,000 new cases, according to data gathered from worldometers.info. Yesterday, the US registered 70,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation‚Äôs leading infectious disease expert said the US is still in the ‚Äúfirst wave‚Äù of the pandemic, given that cases never stabilized to more than a ‚Äúmanageable level.‚Äù He explained that while the Northeast has been able to reduce its outbreak, the national baseline never fell to a more manageable number like 10,000 cases per day.

With a worrying surge of cases across Europe, governments have begun imposing a new round of restrictions. Today, the Czech Republic joined France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom in enforcing a strict nighttime curfew and placing new restrictions in businesses such as gyms and restaurants. 

Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin met for what feels like the hundredth time to discuss the passage of additional stimulus. Pelosi‚Äôs spokesperson Drew Hamill said of the meeting, ‚ÄúThe Speaker remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached before the election,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúprogress depends on Leader Mitch McConnell.‚Äù Today, Senators left Washington for a break ahead of the election. With the election a mere week away and Senators no longer in Washington, chances to pass a bill are extremely thin. 

Next Tuesday, November 3rd are the US presidential elections between Joe Biden (D) and President Trump (R). The election is set to be extremely contentious and will have enormous effect on the market for years to come.

563,Beginner's Guide to Picking Stocks: Step 1 of 10.,1509881098.0,"Hi!
I‚Äôve noticed a lot of posts that are ‚Äúbeginner‚Äù or ‚ÄúVERY BEGINNER! or ‚ÄúLooking to learn‚Äù

So I decided to write about how I personally buy/sell stocks based on qualitative and quantitative reasoning. For example, In 2016, 63% of Apple‚Äôs revenue comes from iPhone sales and they had $245 Billion in cash. In 2017, Apple will release their iPhone X which will probably bring in more revenue.

So this is step 1 of 10. You can go to my [personal blog](http://stockmarketnoob.com/2017/10/26/how-to-invest-in-stocks-for-beginners-the-setup/) or you can just read it on reddit.


**THE SETUP**

This is the first of 10 part series of my ‚Äú10 Step Guide to Investing in Stocks for Beginners‚Äù

There are many different ways to play the stock market. I am going to explain how I personally invest in individual stocks. If you are looking for passive investing, this is not the place so you can probably stop reading this and go buy some low cost index funds. I personally recommend Vanguard or Schwab because the fees are very low.

Also before investing in stocks, I recommend getting rid of any credit card debt and/or student loan debt. It is very hard to move the needle if you are paying 20% interest on credit cards and/or 6% on student loans. Also recommend having a minimum of 6 months to a year of living expenses because when the stock market takes a down turn you don‚Äôt sell your investments and take losses because you don‚Äôt have funds to live.

I am going to split this 10 part investing guide into 2 different sections. Qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative meaning exploitative research. Quantitative is very numerical based research.

The Setup is all about basic house keeping. You should gather any important information about the company.

**These things include:**

- Get the last 5-10 years of annual reports (10-K‚Äôs) and/or quarterly reports (10-Q‚Äôs)

- Executive compensation documents (Proxy Statements)

- Morningstar.com ‚Äì this is a stock market data company that lays out revenue year over year along with many other things.

- Which category is this company classified under? Growth, Slow Grower, Standstill, Asset, Cyclical. (I will explain each in more detail later)

- What industry is this company in? Technology, commodities, consumer goods, financials etc.

**Company Categories**


**Growth**

These are stocks that are growth at a rapid pace. Usually growth stocks are small to medium sized companies, however large companies STILL can be growing pretty fast and small companies can have a negative growth. It is all about the future market opportunity and the tapped market. These growth companies are growing their revenue at a high rates 15%+ and may not be making any profits because they are reinvesting majority of their profits back into the business to grow.


**Slow Growers**

These are usually big old companies that have been around a while and a lot of them pays a dividend. A few examples are Proctor and Gamble, Cisco Systems, American Express, etc. These companies may have departments are rapidly growing, however the company‚Äôs revenue and/or Free Cash Flow as whole is growing at less than 7%.


**Stand Stills**

These tend to be big companies, but also companies that is being disrupted and maybe a negative grower in the future. An example of this is Target. From 2008 to 2013, they were constantly growing their revenue, however since 2014 ‚Äì 2017 they have either lost revenue or kept revenue the same. These companies may have slowly lost their competitive advantage, change of habits and/or tapped their entire market.


**Asset / Hidden Value**

These are a lot harder to recognize since these maybe hidden or just Intellectual Properties so they are not shown on the balance sheet. A common example is real estate companies. The market value of the entire company might be $2 billion, however on the books they might have $4 billion worth in assets so if you bought the entire company you instantly doubled your money.


**Cyclical**

These are companies that do well during a time horizon and sometimes they don‚Äôt do so well during a certain time horizon. A good example of this are car makers. Car makers or airlines are cyclical and for a few years their car sales goes up and one year it drops quite a bit.


Also figure out what industry the company is in. This is because based on the company's industry there are parts of qualitative and quantitative analysis that will greatly affect your decision. For example, auto maker's have very high capital expenditures because they have to build and maintain large factories while software companies do not have factories to maintain.




**TL;DR**

Get necessary documents needed.

Figure out what category the company is in.

Figure out what industry the company is in.

https://i.postimg.cc/3R7176FS/vix.jpg

Is this high level of fear and volatility warranted?

To be honest I don't think we are going to see a new 2008 in terms of how badly the world is hit, because of the corona virus.

Of course the corona virus will have negative economic consequences, but I think the stock markets will rebound slowly around 6 or 12 months from now.

I think the worst thing now, for the stock market is the uncertainty about how many people will get sick from coronavirus and how the states and economies will react. 

How do you think this will all play out and evolve?",2020-03-07 14:17:18

567,What to do with a million dollar inheritance,1608445567.0,"Lets say I hypothetically got close to a million dollar inheritance recently. I've been an occasional stock market investor for a little over 2 years and found out that living off only dividends is a real possibility. I've done some research and calculations and currently been seeing exxon at 42.85 a share giving an annual dividend of 3.48. Now I could live comfortably off 50,000 so I did this calculation: $50,000 √∑ $3.48 = 14,368 shares and 14,368 √ó $42.85 = $615,660.91. I could do the same with AT&T but needing an extra 100k or so. Is this a stupid thing to do, I understand diversification is safe, but this just seems like a reasonable way to live passively. Am I wrong?


*Edit: This has gotten a lot more responses than expected and I want to clarify, I am asking as a hypothetical and I see myself as a beginner. I only made a robinhood account 2 years ago but I only invested actively for a total of probably the equivalent of a week, so I don't have all the terminology of investing down. I knew this isn't the safest or smartest thing to invest in for dividends, I just wanted to know how stupid or actually okay doing something similar to this is and different options from more experienced people, not only professionals. Thanks everyone for the good advice and insults too.",2020-12-19 23:26:07
568,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),1587713432.0,"
This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

571,"Here is a Market Recap for today, Wed, Sept 9. Please enjoy!",1599713967.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 9, 2020**

Stocks shot up today and recovered some losses after sharp declines in big tech stocks. After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a sour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused.

The S&P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.

Today, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose.

US oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. ""Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,"" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Asia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows. For bulls evidence of a rebounding economy, for bears activity is fueled by liquidity and the shoe has yet to drop.

**Highlights**

* After falling nearly 20% in the week, Tesla (TSLA) stock roared back today, finishing the day 10.9% up.
* Big Commerce (BIGC) reported earnings today. While estimates were beaten, investors were not impressed. Stock is down 10% today (4% during session (6% after-hour)

* McConnell announced plans to unveil the new $300B relief bill and took procedural steps needed to set up a vote ""as soon as this week."" Schumer and Pelosi said ""Republicans bill which doesn't come close to addressing the problems and is headed nowhere""

‚ÄúSo, if companies are increasingly meeting their financing needs elsewhere, it seems fair to ask what exactly the point of the stock market is these days. The growth of high-frequency trading, in which players dart in and out of the market seeking to profit from the tiniest price discrepancies, certainly lends credence to the idea that the market is now little more than a glorified casino. Some observers, though, contend that it actually serves a more nefarious purpose ‚Äî that the market, instead of directing capital to its most productive uses, has essentially become a mechanism for draining capital out of the economy in order to funnel ever more of the nation‚Äôs wealth upward. This is being done, goes the argument, primarily through stock buybacks ‚Äî companies repurchasing their own shares.‚Äù",2020-05-29 01:13:22

I‚Äôve been investing in the stock market for a while now but never have I seen these types of gains in history. I‚Äôve read countless books on investing and all points to getting the hell out as soon as possible but the past few months have not been the case. I‚Äôve also been checking online forums and there has seem to be a new wave of overly optimistic investors. It seems like the market should‚Äôve crashed for a second time already (1st in March). Can older investors share their thoughts? Or are we simply entering a new age? The way it has been going since March is something that has not been seen before throughout history.

574,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thurs, Oct 15, 2020. Please enjoy!",1602821173.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 15, 2020**

Stocks fell once again today for the third straight day of losses, as market participants consider a disappointing unemployment report, new virus-related restrictions in Europe, and dimming prospects for additional stimulus before the november election

The Nasdaq finished 0.67% down. The S&P 500 (SPY) fell a modest 0.11% and the Dow finished the day 0.04% down. Stocks were able to mostly recover from the deeply red open. 

The Labor Department released their weekly unemployment, which showed that an additional 898,000 new claims were submitted last week, way above the consensus estimate of 830,000.  This is the highest number since Aug. 22 and another clear sign that the labor market continues to struggle to recover in this pandemic-riddled economy as cases rise and worries increase over a renewed wave in the fall and winter. The number represented a gain of 53,000 from the previous week‚Äôs. The economy has recaptured some 11.4 million positions, or about half those who were sidelined. The unemployment rate has come down to 7.9% but is still more than double its pre-pandemic level.

After Europe seemed to somewhat tame the virus that ravaged the countryside early in the year, the number of newly confirmed infections are skyrocketing, prompting fears of a second-wave and host of new restrictions. Socialising indoors will be banned in London, and a curfew will be imposed in nine French cities. Poland designated red zones where schools and gyms will close, including in the capital Warsaw, and the Czech Republic said it was building its first field hospital for coronavirus patients. Schools in Italy's southern Campania region, including the city of Naples, are to close for two weeks, as the country recorded its highest daily rise of cases since mass testing began. Coronavirus is the fifth-leading cause of death in Europe, where a threshold of 1,000 deaths daily has been passed, the WHO's European director, Dr Hans Kluge, told a news conference today. In the United States, new cases per day are on the rise in 44 states, with the biggest surges in the Midwest and Great Plains, where resistance to wearing masks and observing other social distancing practices has been running high. Deaths per day are climbing in 30 states, according to data collected from John Hopkins University.

Market participants continue to be fixated on whether more stimulus, which lawmakers and economists say is necessary, will be passed before the November election. Messaging from top officials regarding stimulus has been inconsistent, with Pres. Trump first said he was directing his representatives to halt negotiations before doing a 180¬∞ turn. Yesterday, Mnuchin conceded that ‚Äúgetting something done before the election and executing on that would be difficult, just given where we are in the level of details‚Äù. Today, in response to being asked if he supported stimulus, Pres. Trump told Fox Business, ‚ÄúI would. Absolutely I would. I would say more. I would go higher. Go big or go home, I said it yesterday.‚Äù Needless to say the inconsistent messaging heightened volatility in the market as investors have a heightened sense of risk. Additional relief is viewed by many (including Jerome Powell) as a necessary propellant to maintain and speed up economic recovery.

577,No need to panic,1614910280.0,"Why is the market tanking in recent weeks?

First, what it isn't: Treasury yields.  Don't listen to the news.  This just means that no one wants to buy bonds so the price of bonds is going down to attract new investors.  This happens in a healthy economy.  Can't believe the fake news is really pushing this.

What I would see if this was anything other than a correction:

Consumer cyclical and natural resource holdings would increase with major investment firms.  Positions in small cap stocks would decrease.  Real estate holdings would increase.

How I know these things aren't happening:

It's best to track these activities through major firms and ETFs.  I track SPY's holdings daily.  They have teams of analysts and resources I just don't have.  They're the first to know.  I do not watch the news for financial information.

So what is it?

I see firms reorganizing portfolio's for a post-C19 market.  IE, aerospace and defense stocks are going up - Raytheon is up 12%/Boeing up 16% in the same time the Nasdaq was down 9%.  Travel stocks like JetBlue are also doing well in that time frame.

When will it stop?

Who knows, but it couldn't have been expected and it's too late to sell high and buy low now.  I'm waiting it out.  I have been increasing positions with remaining cash but I'm out going forward.

Will tech rebound?

Yes.  New tech is where the money is.  I see strong cross-sector growth continuing through Q3 this year.  Q1 industrial is very strong so far.  Many of these up and coming tech companies are going to be pushing into their manufacturing phases.",2021-03-04 19:11:20
578,Mastercard profit falls as pandemic hits spending volumes,1603917360.0,"https://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNews/idCAKBN27D1R1

(Reuters) - Mastercard Inc (MA.N) reported a 28% slump in quarterly profit on Wednesday as fewer people used its cards to shop, travel and pay bills during the COVID-19 pandemic, hitting transaction volumes for the payment processor.

Mastercard reported a 36% drop in cross-border volume on a local currency basis in the quarter. Gross dollar volume, the dollar value of transactions processed, rose 1% to $1.6 trillion. 

Net income fell to $1.5 billion, or $1.51 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $2.1 billion, or $2.07 per share, a year earlier.

Stock price have been under pressure from the last few days. It dropped from the sep high $367 to $295. But MA and V are still 2 payment stocks that can benefit from a long term perspective. The price around $300 is a good entry point.",2020-10-28 13:36:00

581,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),1595032520.0,"
This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

583,Fairly Conservative Stock Advice for the non Expert,1593115082.0,"&#x200B;

Buy stocks with earnings and increasing revenues. You can forget that occasionally but it takes time to learn when you can do that.

Yahoo finance has all the general info you need to assess a stock in most cases but it'll take a while to learn to navigate for everything.

**If you can find a stock that is going up nicely (during normal times) in volume more than triple its average inexplicably on NO CURRENT NEWS-that is the best way i have found explosive stocks-Finding one in a hot sector is a big plus. It may take 2-3 weeks or more before they start popping. The reason this works is because it indicates some 'wise guys' know something is coming that isn't out yet.  It is best used for small cap to low mid cap generally unknown stocks. Don't use this formula for stocks that have crashed and are now bouncing up.**

Read these boards and watch all the business channels as often as you can-Listen when Buffet speaks. This is to learn basic market and business  principles and not necessarily for specific stock picks. If you hear of an interesting stock, do your own due diligence.

A Drip plan on a Utility or Dividend Mutual Fund where you add extra money of the same amount regularly is the surest way to make a nice score over time. Try to get in when the market tanks and/or up your extra contribution at that time.

Don't EVER buy stocks under $3-$4.   If you have to, make sure you can handle a total loss. If you receive a phone call from a broker you don't know to buy one, don't even think about it-just hang up.

Avoid Margin unless you can transfer in covering funds in a day or two

Buy thinly traded stocks that you like when they are down on low volume.

Never set a GTC order for more than a week or two at most.  You can wind up buying a stock for forty  that is 25 ten minutes later. Much less likely to happen in a week or two and then you can re-assess your decision. If you have a GTC  order, you must read the after market and pre market news so that you can cancel your order if something weird is going on. The exception might be in the crypto market  to set some GTC orders at 60% below market and hope for a flash crash.

With short term trading, only trade stocks with good fundamentals that you wont mind owning if things don't go your way.

Don't buy in the pre market

Once you sell a stock at a profit, don't buy back in on a small drop

Always have 20% cash in case of a market crash. Adding money incrementally and waiting for a 5% rally are usually good ideas

If you get lucky and have a 500% gain or more  inside of a year on a stock, take double your investment  off the table.

Remember  ""No one ever went broke taking a profit"" and You'll never buy at the absolute lows or sell at the highs. When in doubt on taking a profit, sell half!

NONE of this info came from a book. I have never read a book on the market but quite a few articles, watched the business channels, talked extensively to active investors  and been trading and following the market for decades.

(Bloomberg) -- Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway Inc., once the biggest holder of Wells Fargo & Co. common stock, slashed its investment by more than 40% as the San Francisco-based lender copes with the aftermath of consumer-abuse scandals.

Berkshire sold more than 100 million shares, trimming its stake in Wells Fargo common stock to about 3.3%, according to a regulatory filing Friday. A Wells Fargo spokesperson declined to comment.

Berkshire, a long-time investor in the lender, has been trimming its bet in recent months, down to a stake valued at $3.4 billion based on Friday‚Äôs closing price. Wells Fargo is grappling with lingering fallout from its sales scandals plus the effects of the pandemic and related shutdowns across the U.S. That‚Äôs led to a share slump this year of more than 50%.",2020-09-05 01:53:35
586,I built a completely free website that helps you find red flags in your current/prospective investments,1548059731.0,"Hi everyone! For the last several months I've been working on building **[this free website](https://www.lazyfa.com)** for stock market research and I wanted to share the latest updates I've made! 

If you've seen previous posts about this you already know it can do some pretty awesome things like: 

-  [Visualize financial statements in 3D](https://i.imgur.com/p620g2g.mp4)

- Provide you with [buy/sell/hold ratings](https://i.imgur.com/CaRmSyG.png) and quick [overviews/snapshots of company value and financial health](https://i.imgur.com/8FEk0fm.png)

- Visualize annual and quarterly [financial statement data](https://i.imgur.com/RR4Ln2c.png) and [export financial statements to CSV](https://i.imgur.com/h9d34U4.png) files

- Track tons of company [metrics and ratios](https://i.imgur.com/0zVCea6.png)

Now, I've added some amazing red flag detection. It's only partially finished at the moment, but hopefully within the next couple weeks this will be completed and you'll be able to use it to identify earnings manipulation, accounting tricks and even fraud. In the mean time, click on the menu at the top left and go to ""Red Flag Analysis"", then one of the financial statements at the top and you can:

- Monitor the relationship between key items like [revenues and costs](https://i.imgur.com/3CilDj1.jpg) and their [growth rates](https://i.imgur.com/M5DGEbg.png)

- Visualize [exactly what components make up a company's assets and liabilities](https://i.imgur.com/BLlEuAo.jpg), and use interactive charts to see how they change over time

- Monitor key company metrics over time, like [operating cash flow margin](https://i.imgur.com/7Gt2xqf.png), [accounts receivable/payable to sales](https://i.imgur.com/bMDfEiL.png) and [PP&E as a % of total assets](https://i.imgur.com/JE3kObW.jpg).

In the next week or two I'll be added 40-50 automated checks that will identify issues in the financial statements and can alert you to potential earnings manipulation, out of control debt, toxic dilution and a host of other things. 

Anyway, I was happy to be able to add a ton of stuff to the site this week and would love it if everyone could check it out and provide some feedback on things they'd like to see. FWIW, the ""overview"" section of the part I just added is blank cause I wanted to write all the other components before deciding what to put on the overview. That'll fill in soon. Also, foreign companies are NOT converted to USD so if analyzing a foreign company go to the metrics section and find the foreign currency to USD exchange rate to find the number to divide by to get actual USD. I'll be fixing that soon.

For the best performance I recommend using the most modern version of Chrome on a large-ish screen, though it is fairly mobile friendly if you just want to poke around.

Please do comment and let me know what you think and if there's anything you would add/remove/change or if you find any bugs, and I hope it helps you out!

-This company once had a market cap of $78b at a time when Amazon was still at $34b


-This company has been trading sideways for nearly a decade (its most recent price is the same as it was back in September 2012!)


-This company with a market cap of just over $3b, posted revenues of 214m/291m/280m/244m in the last four quarters


-This company is a household name that once rivaled Apple and Samsung in the mobile industry


-This company recently jointed forces with Amazon to create a new, highly sophisticated ""intelligent vehicle data platform""


-175 million vehicles on the road already uses this company's software


-While its peers in the cyber security sector are trading at 50+ Price to Sales ratios (Crowdstrike: ~60x, Cloudfare: ~58x, zscaler: ~54x)... this company is trading at a modest 4x


-In 2018, this company filed a lawsuit against Facebook for violating patents pertaining to its proprietary messenger. The lawsuit is still going on today, though it is unclear whether the judgment will be in this company's favor or if one will come anytime soon.


-This Canadian company used to go by the name ""Research in Motion""


-In 2018, the CEO of this company was by a wide margin the highest paid CEO among CEOs of Canadian publicly listed companies. In fact, he made more than the next top 10 Canadian tech company CEOs combined, and even more than Apple CEO Tim Cook!


Have you guessed it yet?


If your guess was BB (Blackberry Ltd.), you are correct! 


My outlook for BB: It's obvious that the market hasn't taken well to BlackBerry's pivot from a hardware maker to an enterprise software provider. However, its repertoire of patents which accounts for 30% of its revenue has allowed the company to stay afloat during the difficult transition. I will be watching BB for catalysts such as a ruling on the Facebook lawsuit, new development in its partnership with Amazon, and possibly a change of CEO nearing the end of his contract in 2023.

596,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, March 10, 2021. Please enjoy!",1615441450.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, March 10, 2021**

Stocks were mostly higher on Wednesday after new data showed muted levels of inflation in consumer goods, helping quell fears of a rapid jump in prices during the economic recovery. Treasury yields retreated following the report. The 10-year Treasury yield is at 1.521% at the time of writing. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.46% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.59% up. After recordings its best day since April 2020, the Nasdaq fell 0.29%.

The [Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) on Tuesday showed core consumer prices increased less than expected in February.{prices paid by consumers rose only 1.3% in February over last year, coming in below the 1.4% increase expected and slowing from the prior month. While it may not seem like a lot, the report helps quell fears that as economic activity increased and more stimulus was unleashed into the economy, inflationary pressures would begin to materialize. This also suggests the Federal Reserve can maintain its accommodative monetary policy and avoid rising interest rates for the foreseeable future. 

Brian Levitt, global market strategist at Invesco said of inflationary jitters: ‚Äú ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the irony that in year one of a market recovery everybody doubts it and says how can this be happening if the economy isn‚Äôt good, and then in year two everybody struggles to assess whether \[the economy has\] just gotten too good too fast and it‚Äôs too hot. And so the last few days have been the latter story: Markets being disrupted by concerns of inflation and higher rates and premature Fed tightening. And today‚Äôs a little bit of a reprieve on that story as rates come down a bit and investors can start thinking about longer duration assets again.‚Äù

Today, in Washington DC, the House of Representatives is set to vote on the $1.9 trillion stimulus package passed by the Senate over the weekend. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify, is expected to easily pass and be signed into law by President Biden in the coming days.

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday‚Äôs open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average‚Äôs closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow‚Äôs gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday‚Äôs 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer‚Äôs stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday‚Äôs premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. Tesla invests $1.5 billion in bitcoin, which soared to all-time high

> * Tesla, in a SEC filing, said the electric auto maker has purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin after changing its investment policy last month. Bitcoin soared over $43,000 in an all-time high Monday. The Tesla filing also said, ‚ÄúWe expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.‚Äù Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been talking up bitcoin and dogecoin, another cryptocurency, in recent tweets. Shares of Tesla rose in Monday‚Äôs premarket trading.

*****

> # 3. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 4. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump‚Äôs harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as ‚Äúvery unlikely.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 5. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine

> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency‚Äôs vaccine advisory committee.

NFLX revenues for the quarter were $5.77 billion, in line with the Wall Street analyst consensus at $5.76 billion, while profits were $1.57 a share, a little below the Street at $1.65.

604,"Investors should prepare for a coronavirus-induced ‚Äòvicious spiral‚Äô more than twice as bad as the financial crisis, says J.P. Morgan",1586233331.0,"**The current shock originated in the consumer sector, which accounts for 70% of GDP** 

There is a widespread view on Wall Street that the stock market hit  its lowest level of the bear market last month, and that a combination  of an ebbing of the coronavirus in late spring and unprecedented fiscal  and monetary stimulus will set the stage for a sharp rebound in  corporate profits later this year.

On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average [DJIA, 7.730%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote), the S&P 500 index  [SPX, 7.033%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) and the Nasdaq Composite Index [COMP, 7.326%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/COMP?mod=MW_story_quote) [were each rallying](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-rise-as-trump-administration-signals-that-coronavirus-outbreak-may-be-stabilizing-2020-04-05?mod=article_inline) more than 4% on these hopes.

However, Mislav Matejka, head  of global equity strategy at J.P. Morgana warned investors in a Monday  research note that there is a significant chance the global economy  experiences **‚Äúa vicious spiral, which is typical of recessions, between  weak final demand, weaker labor markets, falling profits, weak credits  markets and low oil prices.‚Äù** 

What‚Äôs particularly troubling to Matejka is that the current  recession has been triggered by a shock to the consumer ‚Äî which makes up  70% of GDP in Western economies ‚Äî as workers around the globe are  prevented from earning a living by the closures of nonessential  business. This dynamic has led J.P. Morgan economists to predict ‚Äúonly a  gradual bottoming out in activity, such as seen after the Great  Financial Crisis, and not a V-shaped one that we see, for example, after  natural disasters.‚Äù A so-called V-shaped economic recession is  typically defined as one characterized by a sharp, but brief, slowdown  in business activity that is followed by a powerful rebound.

The bank‚Äôs house view is that the unemployment rate will remain  elevated at 8.5% during the second of the year, while the  peak-to-trough decline in real U.S. GDP will be 10%, versus the 4%  decline during the financial crisis. ‚ÄúAnd this is all assuming that the  virus is history by June, which might prove significantly optimistic,‚Äù  Matejka wrote.

Therefore, he advised clients to ignore technical signals  indicating stocks are oversold, or to be reassured by the massive fiscal  and monetary support provided by global governments. To do so would be  ‚Äúmissing the **elephant in the room, that is the first consumer and labor  market downcycle in 11 years.‚Äù**

‚ÄúWhile consensus view still appears to be a quick recovery,  recessions tend to linger,‚Äù Matejka added. **‚ÄúIt took equities on average 18 months to record the final low in the past.‚Äù**

Stocks rose today to recover most of Thursday‚Äôs losses, with the indices looking to end the week on a high note. Overall, the major indices are still down overall this week, with market participants monitoring record increases in COVID-19 in the US and Europe, renewed stimulus concerns, and positive vaccine data.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.88% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.37% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.4% up. Overall, the three indices are red on the week.

Yesterday, sadly, the US set another record in daily new coronavirus cases, the eight record in the last ten days. On Thursday, the US recorded more than 153,000 new cases of coronavirus, up from 145,00 Wednesday and 110,000 at the beginning of the week. This week alone, the United States added more than 500,000 new cases (Our source for this data was is Johns Hopkins University). The number of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is more than 66,000, also a record since the beginning of the pandemic. Infections are up across the board but states in the South and Midwest have been hit particularly hard. Texas surpassed 1 million cases this week, the first state to do so. North Dakota and Wisconsin have warned their hospitals are reaching capacity, with both State‚Äôs governors declaring a state of emergency. The rise in infections comes with new highs in the number of deaths reported in a single day, with more than 1,600 deaths on Wednesday.

Europe continues to struggle with the surge in coronavirus, with France, the UK, Italy, Belgium, and others entering their second or third week of a second national lockdown. The World Health Organization (WHO) is warning that hospital capacity is filling up at an alarming rate.

Today, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was pulling back from negotiating a new stimulus package. There will likely be no further stimulus until the new President is inaugurated on January 20, 2021.

Earlier in the week, hopes of market participants and the public overall were greatly raised by Pfizer‚Äôs (PFE) announcement that their clinical trial showed their vaccine candidate had a 90% effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 in participants with no evidence of a previous infection. However, optimism moderated after it became clear that even with approval, widespread distribution of the vaccine will be difficult and likely wouldn‚Äôt take place until 2021. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the leading infectious disease expert in the United States, is optimistic that other companies will also report promising vaccine data soon

**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with selling multiple spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

I still have a few positions open from last week and my buying power currently sitting at about half my account. Tickers with positions still open: **BIG, CODX, FROG, NIO, OSTK, PLTR, PSTH, WKHS**. Most are sitting at 20-50% profit already and I'll be looking to close around 60-70% if we get a good pop. Let's see.

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my ""watchlist"". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

&#x200B;

**ARCT - Arcturus Therapeutics ($98)**

[ARCT chart](https://imgur.com/4fzQ7H0)

This ticker has seen a huge upward momentum over the last 2 months and nearly tripled in value. This is also one of Cathie Woods' ARKG largest holdings in the actively managed ETF. The stock failed to continue it's breakout past the $115/$120 level two times and moved sharply lower both times after the rejection. In my opinion we could find some support here at $98. The ARK ETFs are also known to ""buy the dip"" when some of their positions drop. That might be a catalyst in itself to be finding a short-term floor.

**Positions on the watchlist**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $95 strike put sold to open for $9.50 or $950 premium. Return: 10%. Break-even stock price: $85.50.

&#x200B;

**BABA - Baba holdings ($220)**

[BABA chart](https://imgur.com/anuuxVt)

BABA was trending last week due to the probe initiated by the CCP. Anything involving the CCP digging into your company is not good news, but this could also be an opportunity to buy the dip. The arrows on the chart are actually still there from when I first entered positions on BABA almost 6 weeks ago. It's tough tell where the current stock price is so I drew a circle at the bottom below that absolutely massive gap down we just saw. Could this ticker see $200? Yeah, maybe. What I think might happen is CCP ends up putting some of their goons on the board to be able to have more control. BABA is one of the biggest companies to ever come out of China and surely Xi will want to see it's continued success. As long as BABA doesn't become too big to control I think we will see a lot of strength come out of this stock. Due to the drop we've also seen a spike in IV, which is great for us option sellers.

&#x200B;

**Positions on the watchlist**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $210 strike put sold to open for $6.50 or $650 premium. Return: 3%. Break-even stock price: $203.50.

2. IV still moderate here so perhaps purchasing shares and looking for a swing back to $250 range could also be a good play.

&#x200B;

**CRSR - Corsair Gaming ($36)**

[CRSR chart](https://imgur.com/vbTXn9J)

Corsair has been really good to me the last several weeks. I've been selling puts on nearly every dip below $35 level. Last week the stock hit $43 before another sell-off into the $36 range. IV also very good and nearing support. I like to sell puts once again here. Not sure if I will sell at the money or go for the way less risky OTM play. The two options I've selected here are very different. One is closer to ATM with much higher returns and more risk. The 2nd is wayyy OTM, much less risk involved, but also much less return. If you look at the delta for each play on your brokerage you will be able to notice big differences in delta as well. I'm fairly confident in my plays and will therefore most likely selling option #1.

**Positions on the watchlist**

1. Jan 15, 2021 $35 strike put sold to open for $2.90 or $290 premium. Return: 8.3%. Break-even stock price: $32.10

2. Jan 15, 2021 $30 strike put sold to open for $0.95 premium. Return: 3.2%. Break-even stock price: $29.05

&#x200B;

**PLTR - Palantir ($28)**

[PLTR chart](https://imgur.com/BQz0Xhd)

PLTR has also been a favorite of mine to sell puts lately. Almost a month of consolidation now has the stock coiling up for a move in either direction (bullish move -in my opinion). This ticker showcases some very nice benefits of selling CSPs.

1) IV is pretty high, although beginning to fade, so returns are great. Almost 5-10% return per play.

2) Support zones at $24/$25/$26 provide great entry points in my opinion.

3) Selling CSPs at those levels means your break-even share price would be around $22-23.

What does that mean? It means the best case scenario is you collect your full 5-10% premium on each play. Worst case scenario is you become a bag-holder of shares with a cost basis of $23-24. IS OWNING SHARES OF PLTR WITH A COST BASIS OF $24 SOMETHING YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN? LETS GOOO.

&#x200B;

**Positions on the watchlist**

1. Jan 22, 2021 $26 strike put sold to open for $2.15 or $215 in premium. Return: 8.3%. Break-even share price: $23.85

&#x200B;

**SPCE - Virgin Galactic ($26)**

[SPCE chart](https://imgur.com/bDPAJEF)

SPCE was on my watchlist last week, but never got executed into the trade because it opened up 5% Monday morning. Sitting at the $25 support I think we'll see more buyers come in every dollar it goes down. Premiums are still high on this ticker so if the stock continues to fall and I lose this position it means I will be bagholding at around $22 level, which I am ok with.

**Positions on the watchlist**

1. Jan 22, 2021 $24 strike put sold to open for $1.60 or $160 in premium. Return: 6.7%. Break-even share price: $22.40

&#x200B;

**CRM - Salesforce ($225)**

[CRM chart](https://imgur.com/Jm7qQL0)

CRM was on my list pre-earnings in early December. The stock gapped down big and I ended up getting assigned the shares. Last week my shares were called away and I still closed my position up 4%. This is what I like about cash-secured-puts on good stocks. You can always baghold and sell-covered calls to remain profitable on nearly every position you enter. All it takes is patience! Moving along, CRM has been trading sideways for quite some time. Even post-earnings when they announced the Slack acquisition the floor has been set at $220. This stock could be due for a break-out in my opinion. Unfortunately IV is low so I will buy 100-200 shares outright aiming for the stock to hit $230-235+ zones.

**Positions on the watchlist**

1. 100-200 shares. I will take profit when target hits around $235 zone. Might do covered calls depending  what return I will be looking at, but most likely will sell 0.10-0.15 delta bi-weekly covered call.",2020-12-27 21:48:44
614,"Confused investors keep buying FORD, thinking it's Ford",1565726412.0,"https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/12/investing/ticker-symbol-confusion/index.html

New York(CNN Business) Just about every time Ford Motor makes big news, some investors mistakenly buy shares of Forward Industries, a tiny maker of carrying cases for medical monitoring systems and other electronic devices.

That's because Forward Industries (FORD), which is worth just $10 million, trades under the ticker symbol ""FORD."" The iconic Ford Motor (F) has the ticker symbol of ""F.""

HP confuses investors too. When either of the two tech companies that were part of the original Hewlett Packard tech conglomerate are in the news, shares of oil services company Helmerich & Payne (HP), which actually trades under the ticker symbol ""HP,"" often moves in the same direction. PC company HP's ticker symbol is ""HPQ"" while Hewlett Packard Enterprises trades under ""HPE.""

Snapchat parent Snap (SNAP) and tool maker Snap-on (SNA) often get confused. Newly public web conferencing firm Zoom Video (ZM) and Zoom Technologies (ZOOM), which is a thinly traded Chinese wireless company, are often mistaken for one another.

618,Options Trading Basics for Beginnersüí•,1587250517.0,"I want to preface this post by saying that I *personally* only trade stocks at the moment and do not have a ton of experience trading options, which is why all of my posts and education are based around stocks. With that being said, I have done my fair share of options trading in the past and definitely know enough of the basics to share for all the traders that ask me about options on a daily basis. If you already have a bit of experience with options, this post may not be very beneficial to you because I'm just going to cover the basics of options, how they work, and give a quick rundown on ways that you can trade them!

First and foremost, **what are options?** Options are actually... *options*. When you buy an option contract, you then have the option to buy or sell the underlying stock at a pre-determined price up to a pre-specified date. If you decide to do this, you are then ""exercising"" your options.

There are two types of options that you can trade, which are call options and put options. **Call options,** or just ""calls,"" allow the holder to **buy** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to simply buying or longing the underlying stock. Because of this, your call options' price will generally rise as the price of the underlying stock rises. **Put options,** or just ""puts,"" allow the holder to **sell** at the pre-determined price and are the options equivalent to short-selling the underlying stock. Because of this, your put options' price will generally rise as the underlying stock declines. Because one single option contract represent 100 shares of the underlying stock, you would have 100 shares of that stock for every call contract that you exercised.

[https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y](https://imgur.com/a/WQrLJ1y)

Now, the pre-determined price that you can either buy or sell you shares at by exercising your option contract(s) is known as the **strike price.** When buying options you have to choose a strike price, along with an **expiration date,** which is the last day that your options can be exercised. Both the strike price and expiration date play a big role in choosing which contracts to buy, because they greatly affect how the options will trade. Before getting into why these have such a big affect on the options, it's important to know a bit more general options information.

*As for strike prices,* there are really two main kinds. **In The Money (ITM)** and **Out of The Money (OTM)**. ITM and OTM refer to the underlying stock's price in relation to the strike price of the contract. Calls with a strike price below the current price of the underlying stock are considered ITM, whereas calls with a strike price above the current price would be considered OTM. On the other side of the spectrum... since you want the stock's price to go down when you own puts, your put options would be ITM if the strike price is above the current stock price and OTM if the strike price is below the current stock price.

[https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP](https://imgur.com/a/MgopDLP)

I know it's a bit confusing if you're new to options. **To give an example:** If stock XYZ was trading at $100, a call option with a strike price of $90 would be ITM since the underlying stock is already above the strike price. However since calls and puts are essentially opposite, a put with a strike price of $90 would be an OTM put in this scenario.

Whether an option is ITM or OTM has a big impact on how to option will trade. The main reason for this is because **all** OTM options are **worthless** at expiration. This means that if you invested $100 by buying one call option at $1.00 ($1.00 x 100), your contract would be worth $0 if it was OTM at the market's close on the expiration date and you would lose your full $100 investment. Because of this, OTM options are generally higher risk, higher reward than ITM options. Although ITM won't be worthless at expiration like OTM options, they will still lose value over time because all options are affected by time decay.

**Time decay** in options causes the price of the contracts, also known as the **premium**, to decrease as it gets closer to expiration. This alone makes being a profitable options trader much more difficult in my opinion, because even if the price of the underlying stocks remains the same for days at a time, both calls and puts will decrease in value because of the time decay. So in order to profit from options, you have to not only be right about the stock's direction, but you have to time it near perfectly as well to avoid your position from being eaten away by time decay.

Time decay, along with other factors that go into analyzing options contracts, are represented by what are known as **Greeks.** The Greeks are theta, vega, delta, and gamma. Like I said, the meaning of this post is really just to cover the basics so I'm not going to go into a ton of detail on the Greeks in this post, but I do at least want to explain theta. **Theta** is the greek representing time decay in options. You can see an options theta (along with the other Greeks) before you even trade it and it can tell you how much the contract is expected to be affected by time decay. Generally, the theta will be higher for OTM options because they affected more significantly by time decay since they ultimately expire at $0. Similarly, theta will be higher for options that are a few weeks away from expiration compared to options a few months away from expiration, because they lose more value as the expiration date approaches.

Theta makes general trading rules like *""don't fight the trend""* even more important. For example, if you bought calls in a downtrending stock because you thought that it was near its bottom, you would end up losing money because of theta if that stock did bottom out and started to consolidate at support. So in this situation you'd be correct about the stock finding the bottom, but you would still lose money if it didn't start to bounce back up quickly. If you had just bought the underlying stock rather than call options, you'd be at breakeven as the stock found its temporary bottom and began consolidating at support.

[https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU](https://imgur.com/a/7i4avcU)

Although time decay can have a major negative impact on your options trades, there is actually a way to have it work in your favor. You can short options contracts, which is also called **writing.** Just like with shorting stocks, you profit from the price going down so time decay create profits for options that you sold short. In my opinion, this should really only be done by experienced traders though because writing options creates more overall risk than regular buying and selling.

The reason is because there is technically no limit to how how options can go and if you short either calls or puts, you would lose money as the options increase in price. It's the same reason that many people are afraid to short-sell stocks, but options are generally more volatile, which creates even more risk. Even though I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for beginners, I wanted to at least explain the concept of writing options in this post.

Regardless of how you trade options, it's important to at least understand all of these factors that go into their fluctuations and how their premiums are priced. Like any other type of trading, you should only be using money that you can afford to lose in its entirety while trading options... especially if you're trading the extremely volatile contracts that are near their expiration, which are the ones that attract so many traders because of their ability to make big runs in a short period of time.

Maybe after this you'll see why I stick to trading stocks rather than options. They can definitely be a great tools for experienced traders, but they're much more complex than most new traders think and can be very dangerous for inexperienced traders that are enticed by the big potential returns.

The stock market rose today, with the Nasdaq, S&P 500, and Russell 2000 setting new records in the shortened, post-Thanksgiving trading day. The Dow lagged behind a bit but is the best performing index this month. Optimism that an effective coronavirus vaccine could roll out relatively soon is counterbalancing the surging infection rates, with health officials warning about holiday travel.

The positive vaccine news keep coming. After announcing their vaccine candidate was 95% effective in preventing COVID-19, Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) have filed for an emergency use authorization with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US. If approved, the vaccine could roll out their vaccine for health workers and the most vulnerable starting in December. Moderna (MRNA) also announced their vaccine candidate is 94.5% effective is expected to file for emergency use authorization very soon. 

The vaccine candidate from AstraZeneca (AZN) and the University of Oxford has come under harsh scrutiny since the company announced the results, prompting the company to initiate another global trial. Since the vaccine announcement, the stock is around 3.6% down. 

During Thanksgiving, the US reported more than 100,000 new cases of coronavirus, the 24th day in a row the number is above 100,000. These are shockingly high numbers given around 20 states did not report data yesterday because of the holiday. Dr. Fauci and other top health officials are repeatedly warning Americans to reconsider their Thanksgiving plans and not travel to prevent transmission spread. However, many did not heed the warning, with more than 7 million travelers in the week before Thanksgiving. 

**Highlights**

* UPS, which is playing a key role in the deliveries along with FedEx (FDX), said in a statement Tuesday it is preparing to produce 1,200 pounds of dry ice per hour in its facilities. ‚ÄúUPS Healthcare now can produce up to 1,200 lbs. of dry ice per hour in its U.S. facilities to support the storage and transportation of cold chain products, such as frozen vaccines, in accordance with manufacturer storage requirements. The increased production also allows UPS to make dry ice available for U.S. and Canadian hospitals, clinics and other points of care requiring dry ice to store vaccines locally,‚Äù the company said.
* The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) ‚Äî the market‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúfear gauge‚Äù ‚Äî briefly dipped below 20 on Friday, its lowest level in 9 months. Market participants are optimistic for future growth.
* After the recent monster rally, Tesla (TSLA) now has higher market cap than Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)
* Northeast Securities analyst Li Hengguang launched coverage of the Chinese electric-vehicle maker with a Buy rating and $55 price target.
* Tesla (TSLA) to recall 870 cars in China over roof defect.
* Facebook's (FB) Libra cryptocurrency is readying to launch as early as January, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing three unidentified people involved in the project.
* The Geneva-based Libra Association that will issue and govern Libra plans to launch a single digital coin backed by the dollar, the FT said, citing one of the people.
* Walt Disney (DIS) set to layoff 32,000 workers as demand for amusements parks remains low
* EV-battery developed QuantumScape (QS) began trading today after SPAC merger went through. Stock was up more than 50% today

The S&P 500 and Dow Jones hit record highs early in the morning before turning steeply negative as stimulus talks in Washington appear to hit a roadblock. 

Today, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell spoke on the Senate floor and accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of ‚Äúdelaying, deflecting and moving the goalposts‚Äù during stimulus negotiations. This snuffed out investor confidence that a deal would get done, at least in the near-term. Here at Psycho, we don‚Äôt expect the passage of more stimulus until a change in White House administration and control of the Senate is decided. 

Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin revealed he offered Pelosi a new proposal worth $916 billion. He said his plan ‚Äúincludes money for state and local governments and robust liability protection for businesses, schools, and universities.‚Äù Last week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers had unveiled a stimulus outline worth about $908 billion, which diverged from Mnuchin‚Äôs plan on some key issues, including offering $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits absent from Mnuchin‚Äôs proposal, according to Yahoo Finance.

Earlier in the week, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released data that reaffirmed that Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech‚Äôs (BNTX) vaccine candidate was effective within approximately 10 days after the dose and showed strong protection regardless of age, weight, race, or gender. The FDA is now scheduled to convene its panel of outsider Thursday, with the group expected to vote on the approval of the vaccine.

The United States recorded its second-worst day of infections Tuesday, with another 220,000 infections. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, says the full impact of Thanksgiving gatherings hasn‚Äôt been seen yet. He said, ‚ÄúThe blip from Thanksgiving isn't even here yet. So we‚Äôre getting those staggering numbers of new cases and hospitalizati0ns before we even feel the full brunt of the Thanksgiving holiday‚Äù. The US is averaging nearly 200,000 infections and 2,237 deaths in the last seven numbers, the deadliest week in the pandemic since late April, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are well over 100,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus.

**Highlights** 

* Canada officially approves Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech‚Äôs (BNTX) coronavirus vaccine.
* The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a coalition of attorneys general from 48 states and territories filed two separate antitrust lawsuits against Facebook (FB) on Wednesday. The lawsuits target two of Facebook‚Äôs major acquisitions, Instagram and WhatsApp, alleging anticompetitive behavior. In response, Facebook General Counsel said, ‚ÄúAntitrust laws exist to protect consumers and promote innovation, not to punish successful businesses. Instagram and WhatsApp became the incredible products they are today because Facebook invested billions of dollars, and years of innovation and expertise, to develop new features and better experiences for the millions who enjoy those products. The most important fact in this case, which the Commission does not mention in its 53-page complaint, is that it cleared these acquisitions years ago. The government now wants a do-over.‚Äú
* QuantumScape, the electric battery developer was on fire again today, up around 30% in the day. The stock is up 125% since the merger finalized.
* DoorDash (DASH) shares open for trading at $182, almost double their IPO price of $105.

*****
> Markets face more violent swings in the coming week as investors watch out for a rising number of coronavirus cases and new data that could show how the virus is slamming the U.S. economy.
*****
> The past week was brutal for stock investors with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a 17.3% decline, its worst week since October 2008. But it was the stressed-out credit markets that were at the vortex of pain with a standstill in corporate paper and spreads widening in all areas, from corporates to mortgages.
*****
> As economists looked for an even sharper economic downturn from the impact of social distancing, the Federal Reserve in the past week continued to fire away with new programs and liquidity to grease the wheels of nervous markets. By Friday, the dollar stopped its surge, and the Treasury market was a little calmer, with the benchmark 10-year yields sliding under 1% after a wild ride higher earlier in the week.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe Fed is buying about $70 billion in off-the-run Treasurys today. That brings their total purchases this week to $300 billion,‚Äù said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist at Incapital, on Friday. ‚Äù$160 billion was the highest we saw in any week during the financial crisis.‚Äù
*****
> # Sharp recession
> In the week ahead, there is fresh data on manufacturing and the service sector when Markit releases its flash Purchasing Manager Indexes for manufacturing and services on Tuesday.
*****
> Consumer sentiment will be important when it is released Friday, but the big tell for the economy will be unemployment claims on Thursday, which are expected to show the impact of massive layoffs at restaurants, stores and other businesses that were forced to close or reduce activity to prevent the spread of the virus.
*****
> Claims rose by 33% in the past week to 281,000, an unprecedented jump outside of times of natural disasters like hurricanes. Some strategists say the claims could easily jump to 1 million or more.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to start to see the magnitude of the coronavirus impact on the economy. We already started to see some of it in the weekly claims and now we‚Äôre going to get a clearer picture,‚Äù said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Arone said he‚Äôs watching the PMI data. ‚ÄúThis data is going to inform us how bad it could get, give us some guidance, some rough rules of the road. Right now, it‚Äôs sell first, ask questions later.‚Äù
*****
> Economists increasingly expect a very sharp but quick recession, starting now. Goldman Sachs economists expect a shocking 24% contraction in second quarter gross domestic product after a 6% decline in the first quarter. The economists expect unemployment to shoot up to 9% from 3.5%, but they see a rebound with growth at 12% in the third quarter.
*****
> ‚ÄúI expect that we‚Äôll see abnormal volatility in markets until we begin to see that infection curve flatten, or we see some type of health remedy, vaccine or some solution. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to see that in the next few weeks at least,‚Äù said Arone. As of Friday, there were about 14,200 cases of the virus in the U.S.
*****
> # More Fed Artillery
> Leary and others believe there is more room for the Fed to expand its arsenal, and that could include corporate debt purchases. Investment grade corporate debt funds and exchange traded funds saw record outflows of nearly $44 billion in the last week, according to Bank of America.
*****
> The Fed has already slashed interest rates to zero, added $1 trillion in daily repo operations, and created facilities to help commercial paper, money markets and municipal debt. The dollar has rocketed higher since March 9, and the Fed also expanded swap lines with other central banks, which helped stop the dollar‚Äôs run on Friday.
*****
> As the world‚Äôs reserve currency, companies, investors, banks and other institutions worldwide are looking to raise cash and they want it in dollars, the safest, most liquid currency. That rapid move to cash put a strain on the foreign exchange market, and sent the dollar higher and other currencies sharply lower.
*****
> ‚ÄúI think the market is going to be looking for indications that there‚Äôs some sort of stabilization, or maybe even a hint of stabilization and that policy makers are taking the right action. I think we‚Äôre not yet at that cathartic moment of peak pessimism,‚Äù said Ben Randol, foreign exchange strategist at Bank of America. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm watching what‚Äôs going to happen over the weekend because some pretty big numbers [of new virus cases] could come out, not just in the U.S. but in other countries.‚Äù
*****
> # ‚ÄòLiquidity infinity‚Äô
> Strategists say it would not be surprising to see more Fed policy moves next week, and a big fiscal stimulus package is expected to come up in Congress on Monday, to ease the impact of job losses on individuals and help companies weather the downturn.
*****
> John Briggs, head of strategy at NatWest Markets, said the bond market responded to the Fed‚Äôs actions to make more dollars available, seeming to slow the sale of Treasurys by those parties looking to raise cash. ‚ÄúThings are settling into ranges Friday afternoon, because we can‚Äôt take it anymore,‚Äù he said.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe amount of policy thrown at this market was staggering ... Liquidity infiinity is what I‚Äôm calling it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBy the weekend, the whole country is literally going to be shut . You have claims at state unemployment offices skyrocketing. What‚Äôs the good news over the weekend? That they‚Äôre going to pass this bill? That‚Äôs already in the price.‚Äù

# How Markets Bottom

> With US equities firmly in a bear market, even the most long-term investors are now looking ahead to when the selling may stop and where the S&P 500 Index might ultimately bottom. ‚ÄúNobody knows exactly how this market bottom will play out,‚Äù said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúHowever, using history as guide, we know markets tend to retest or even slightly break previous lows.‚Äù

> We took a look at how markets have bottomed for two previous bear markets that show similarities to the current sell-off, in terms of speed and magnitude. As shown in the chart below, following Black Monday, the largest single-day decline in the history of the S&P 500, the index rebounded modestly, before undercutting its lows about six weeks later. However, a look at the bottom panel shows that the momentum, or speed, of that move was significantly less extreme and markets went on to rally, ultimately eclipsing the 1987 peak less than two years later.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-1.png?ssl=1))**

> The 2008-2009 financial crisis tells a similar story. While the S&P 500 Index didn‚Äôt ultimately reach its low until March 2009, most stocks actually bottomed during the fall 2008, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Even though the S&P 500 undercut the October lows by a full 10%, this divergence, similar to the momentum observed in 1987, shows that things were improving under the surface even if the price of the index didn‚Äôt yet reflect it.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Technical-2.png?ssl=1))**

> It may be too early to say that the initial leg of our current decline is done, but certainly we have seen extreme fear and a historic decline in markets. One positive‚Äîthe S&P 500 has yet to close below its December 2018 lows. Soon it may be time to start hunting for signs of a bottom.

# Stocks Approach 2009 Valuations vs. Bonds

> We rolled out our Road to Recovery Playbook at the start of the week to help investors gauge where the market is in its bottoming process. The first and most important piece of that playbook‚Äîvisibility into a peak in new COVID-19 cases‚Äîremains elusive, but we hope to have a clearer picture with the next couple of weeks as containment efforts have more time to work. We continue to monitor cases daily and plan to update you on that progress regularly during this crisis.

> We‚Äôre getting closer to checking off the other four boxes. We would just like to see a bit more economic data consistent with recession‚Äîalmost surely coming soon‚Äîand to get more clarity on the timing, size, and nature of the policy response before checking off those two boxes on our list. The technical analysis and sentiment box was checked last week‚Äîthe amount of bearishness among investors is near the levels of prior bear market lows.

> The last box‚Äîmarkets pricing in recession‚Äîwas also checked last week based on the magnitude of the sell-off. The nearly 30% drop in the S&P 500 Index from the February 19 high is close to the average peak-to-trough decline in recessions at about 35%.

> Another way to show a recession is priced in and stocks may be near their ultimate bottom is by valuing stocks relative to bonds, sometimes called the equity risk premium (ERP), which we show in the LPL Chart of the Day.

> ‚ÄúStocks are now historically cheap by most measures after this selloff,‚Äù noted LPL Chief Investment Officer Burt White. ‚ÄúWhen comparing stock valuations to bond yields, we are approaching levels only seen during some of the worst bear markets over the past 50 years.‚Äù

> The equity risk premium compares the earnings yield on the S&P 500 (the inverse of the price-to-earnings ratio) to the 10-year US Treasury yield. That number as of March 18 was 4.9%, well above the long-term average of 0.8% (it was higher on March 16 when the 10-year Treasury yield was 0.73% rather than 1.18%). That compares to historical peaks between 6 and 7% in 1974 and shortly after the financial crisis.

> The bottom line is that if this trend holds equity investors could be well compensated over time for the risks they are taking now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ERP-blog-chart-3-19-20-revised-disclosure-v2.png?ssl=1))**

> We know it‚Äôs tough to see the other side of this crisis right now, and the volatility is unnerving for all of us. But historically, investors who owned stocks at these valuations have been rewarded over time. We think this time will be no different.

# How Quickly Can Stocks Recover From COVID-19?

> The market volatility continues, as the S&P 500 Index has closed either up or down 4% or more for a record 7 consecutive days. With the S&P 500 Index down 30% from the highs, it has officially moved into a bear market. Yesterday, we took a look at how stocks did after the lows of major corrections formed, and today we‚Äôll take another angle on this.

> We do not know if down 30% is the lows; in fact, it probably isn‚Äôt. The good news is we feel we are getting close to a major low. How quickly could stocks regain their February 19 highs? ‚ÄúHistorically we‚Äôve found that some of the quickest market sell-offs can lead to some of the fastest recoveries,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the good news. The bad news is if the economy falls into a recession, it can take longer.‚Äù

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, there have been 14 previous bear markets since 1950, and it took an average of 20 months from the bear market lows to recover the losses*. Taking this a step further, when the economy avoided a recession, the recovery took only 10 months, versus 30 months for a recession, although a lot of that is because bear markets accompanied by recessions are typically deeper. Last, the last three bear markets that avoided a recession recovered the gains in 3 months, 4 months, and 4 months after the ultimate bear lows were made.

# Looking To The Other Side of The Bear

> The indiscriminate selling continued yesterday, with one of the worst days in stock market history. Fears over the potential impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) have led to one of the steepest sell-offs in history, rivaling what we saw in 1962 and 1987.

> With the S&P 500 Index down 30% from the all-time highs set less than a month ago on February 19, it is quite clear the stock market is voting on a significant economic slowdown over the coming months. Historically, during bear markets we have found that stocks pulled back 37% on average during a recession and 24% on average if a recession is avoided. With stocks currently down right near the middle of this, the economy could be about a coin flip to going into a recession or not. We discuss this idea and more in our latest LPL Market Signals Podcast.

> What happens next? ‚ÄúClearly no one knows how bad things could get and when stocks will ultimately bottom, but we feel we are getting close,‚Äù explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúThe good news is a year after previous market corrections end, as scary as they all felt at the time, stock performance has historically been quite strong, higher more than 90% of the time.‚Äù

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, there have been 31 other 10% corrections or more for the S&P 500, according to data from our friends at Ned Davis Research. We‚Äôd like to stress, we don‚Äôt know when this weakness will end, but if we are close, the average return after a correction ends has been more than 23% on average and higher more than 90% of the time.

# COVID-19 Collapse vs. Other Major Downturns

> Even though equities rose today, the S&P 500 still remains over 28% off of the 2/19 high. As of yesterday's close, only twenty days after the S&P 500's peak, the index was down nearly 32% from that high. Below is a look at the current selloff from its high versus prior big selloffs since 1928. We all know about the 1929 and 1987 market crashes, but this one has even those beat in terms of the time it took to fall this much. And the two major peaks and subsequent bear markets of the 21st century both took basically a year to fall the same amount that we've fallen in just 20 trading days this time.

# Oil Slippery

> Like a flopping wet fish, it's been incredibly hard to get a hold on an accurate price of crude oil this week. With a gain of 22.2% so far today, WTI is experiencing its largest one-day gain on record (dating back to 1983). The next closest largest one-day gain was in December 2008 when crude rallied 17.8%. While today's gain is impressive, keep in mind that it followed yesterday's decline of 24.4% which ranks as the third-largest one-day decline on record and last week's 24.6% decline on March 9th. In fact, three of the four largest one-day percentage moves in WTI have all come in the last two weeks!

> While a big gain in any asset class always leads to questions over whether it is the start of a new run higher, we would caution that following the prior nine largest one-day gains on record, crude oil's median change over the next week was a decline of 4.4%.

# Russell 2000's Third Largest Drawdown on Record

> While US large cap stocks are right around 30% from their record highs a month ago, the carnage in small caps has been even more severe. While the Russell 2000 never quite made a new high this year along with the broader market, it got pretty close. Like the rest of the market, though, it has been crushed. As of yesterday's close, the Russell 2000 was 43.1% below its all-time high which ranks as the third-largest decline from a record high. The only two periods where the Russell saw a larger decline were in October 2002 when the drawdown reached 46.1% and then in March 2009 when the selling finally stopped at 59.9% on March 9, 2009. Now, if the Russell 2000 were to match either of those prior two periods in terms of magnitude, it would have to fall an additional 4.3% to match the decline of October 2002 or 28.9% to match the decline of March 2009.

# The Buck's Bounce

> In the currency space, the US dollar has certainly not been immune from recent market volatility. The dollar index peaked on February 20th, just one day after the S&P 500 had reached its all time highs. That was the dollar's highest level since April of 2017. Over the following days, the dollar would go on to fall roughly 5% to its low on March 9th. In the time since then, it has more than recovered those losses, rising over 6% and is once again back up to its highest levels since 2017.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-.png))**

> This string of volatility for the greenback is rare. As of today, the dollar is up 4.26% over the past ten days. But just back on the ninth (the recent low) it had been lower by 4.12% over the prior ten days. The last time that there was both a 10-day change up and down of at least 4% in the span of just ten days was back in October of 2008. Going back through the index's history since the early 1970s, there have been a total of 15 days (including that 2008 and current instances) in which such swings can be observed; shown by the red dots in the chart below. Prior to 2008, the only other times the dollar was as volatile by this measure was in the 1980s and late 1970s. So with regards to more recent history, it is even more unprecedented.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/03/031820-10-Day-Change.png))**

> In terms of daily changes, the dollar has also been very volatile. Over the past ten days, the currency has averaged a daily change (positive or negative) of just over 1% which is rare going back through history. Again this is the most volatile the dollar has been since the financial crisis, though at that time, the daily swings were larger on average; reaching 1.35% at the high. Prior to 2008, the only other times the average daily change was over 1% was in the early 1990s, mid-1980s, and late 1970s. As with 2008, those past times were slightly more volatile than the current moment.

* In addition, Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on an additional $325 billion of Chinese goods ‚Äúshortly.‚Äù
* The president said that trade talks with China are continuing, but are moving too slowly as Beijing tries to re-negotiate.

*****

> President Donald Trump said Sunday that tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods will increase to 25% on Friday, despite repeated claims by the administration in recent weeks that trade talks with Beijing were going well. 

> The tariff rate on those goods was originally set at 10%. Trump had originally threatened to increase the tariffs at the start of the year, but postponed that decision after China and the US agreed to sit down for trade talks.

> In addition, Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on an additional $325 billion of Chinese goods ‚Äúshortly.‚Äù 

> The president said that trade talks with China are continuing, but are moving too slowly as Beijing tries to re-negotiate.

> On Friday, Vice President Mike Pence told CNBC that Trump remained hopeful that he could strike a deal with China. 

> And on Wednesday, the White House said the latest round of talks had moved Beijing and Washington closer to an agreement. Press secretary Sarah Sanders said, ‚ÄúDiscussions remain focused toward making substantial progress on important structural issues and re-balancing the US-China trade relationship.‚Äù

> There had been multiple reports that China and U.S. were close to a trade deal, and an agreement could come as soon as Friday.

> Major sticking points between the U.S. and China have been intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. There has also been disagreement as to whether tariffs should be removed or remain in place as an enforcement mechanism.

627,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, November 4, 2020. Please enjoy!",1604552727.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 4, 2020**

Stocks rose today, continuing the week‚Äôs rally, as investors took in developments from the 2020 presidential election, which has so far produced no clear winner. The presidential race is extremely close, with a number of consequential battle states, like Pennsylvania and Nevada unlikely to produce results until at least tomorrow. The flurry of news made for a volatile overnight session, that at one point saw the Nasdaq futures spike from being slightly down to over 4% up. 

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 3.85% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 2.18% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished the day 1.35% up.

As of this afternoon, according to the Associated Press, Joe Biden has 248 electoral votes to Pres. Trump‚Äôs 214. Candidates need 270 votes to win. However, because of the surge in mail-in ballots this election due to the pandemic, counting the votes is expected to take longer than normal. Despite the race being to close to call, last night, President Trump falsely declared victory while simultaneously questioning the veracity of the election process, due to the ongoing count of mail-in ballots. Trump indicated that he was willing to challenge attempts by states to keep counting ballots after election night, despite it being well known that the surge in mail-in ballots would cause complications and slow counting. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop,‚Äù Trump said to a crowd of supporters at the White House. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want them to find any ballots ... and add them to the list. We‚Äôre were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.‚Äù Biden‚Äôs campaign has suggested it would be willing to fight Trump in court.

Joe Biden also too expressed confidence that the vote would go his way. ‚ÄúWe feel good about where we are. We really do. I‚Äôm here to tell you tonight we believe we‚Äôre on track to win this election.‚Äù

In the Senate elections, the so-called ‚Äúblue wave‚Äù many pundits predicted did not happen. As of this morning, Democrats only managed a net gain of one seat, whereas they needed at least three to establish a majority. Democrats missed opportunities to flip seats where they could. South Carolina and Montana were rated toss-ups, and Texas was only rated slightly Republican. If Democrats broke through in one or more of those races, it would have likely portended a good night for them. Instead, Republicans appear to have won all of them handily:

**Highlights**

* California voters carried Uber and Lyft to victory, overwhelmingly approving Proposition 22, a ballot measure that allows gig economy companies to continue treating drivers as independent contractors. Uber, Lyft, and the delivery service DoorDash designed the measure to exempt the companies from a state labor law that would have forced them to employ drivers and pay for health care, unemployment insurance, and other benefits. As a concession to labor advocates, the initiative offers a wage floor and limited benefits to drivers.
* Health-care stocks led in the 30-stock Dow, with UnitedHealth Group rallying 9% and Amgen up more than 6%. Industrials including Caterpillar and Dow Inc. The index was up more than 550 points, or 2%.
* The communication and information technology sectors of the S&P 500 performed very well today also.
* The Nasdaq extended its gain to more than 4%, as each of Amazon, Facebook, Alphabet, Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft surged
* Trading volumes in currency markets were unusually low for an election night, Mr. Tew said, in part because investors and traders were reluctant to put on new positions given the uncertainty.
* Bank shares dropped Wednesday, a sharp departure from the broader market as investors bet that another round of stimulus relief will be hard to come by. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index was down 3.3% around midday. The broader S&P 500 rose 3.1% in volatile trading.
* Biogen Inc (BIIB) shares rose for the day because FDA briefing documents showed the company had provided enough data to support the approval of its Alzheimer's drug. Which is a pretty big deal, shares were halted at one point finishing up the day about 45%.
* Cassava Sciences (SAVA) share were also training higher, finishing 25% up after presenting positive phase 2b data on Alzheimer's study.
* AGCO (AGCO) had target raised by:
   * Morgan Stanley $84 to $95 EQUAL WEIGHT
   * BMO Capital Markets $90 to $110 OUTPERFORM
   * Royal Bank of Canada $88 to $104 OUTPERFORM

* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) had a nice UPGRADE from Goldman Sachs (GS) from NEUTRAL to BUY and price target raised from $84 to $96. Nice call, will be keeping an eye on this one.
* Sysco (SYY) with target raise by Credit Suisse from $76 to $80 at OUTPERFORM. Stock currently around $60
* Alleghany (Y) with price target increase by Deutsche Bank (DB) from $785 to $800. Notable because the stock is around $580 right now.

632,When to Cut Losses on a Stock Trade,1592090840.0,"When to cut losses on a stock trade is one of the most important decisions to make about about a trade, yet it's often overlooked because most new traders are unsure of how to come up with a risk level. The goal of this post is to cover what you should take into consideration while managing risk and cutting losses on a trade. If you think that you don't need to focus much on cutting losses and can simply hold until the stock bounces back... the market has just yet to humble you! 

That trading style is how you end up *""bag holding.""* A **bag holder** is someone that holds onto a loss for as long as it takes for the stock to bounce back enough for them to get out at breakeven or even a profit. However, they don't always bounce back so bag holding is not a trading style used by successful, consistently profitable traders. Even when the stock does bounce back and the trader gets to exit at breakeven instead of taking a loss, you should still consider how much opportunity was lost while the money was tied up in a losing position! Simply put, when you're bag holding you can't put your money to work in the market on better trade setups and miss out of potential profits.

So how do you avoid this? *Simple.* **Cut losses!** I know... easier said than done, but it's crucial for long-term success in the market. You have to just *""rip the bandaid off""* and move on from the long trade. After all, even the best of the best don't trade with 100% accuracy.

The price level you use to cut your losses is actually something you should know of before even entering the trade. This risk level should be part of your trade plan and can be found using some very basic technical analysis. One of the key point made when talking about a level of support is the fact that if a stock breaks below support, it is likely to continue lower until new support is met or formed *(assuming it's not a* *false breakdown)*. For that reason, you can use a level of support not only to buy in hopes that the stock will once again bounce from that price, but also as a risk level in case it does not.

[https://imgur.com/a/pjKkDx0](https://imgur.com/a/pjKkDx0) 

Before setting your risk level to cut losses directly at nearest support level though, keep in mind the possibility of the stock returning to support or even very briefly dipping slightly below support before bouncing back up. In that case, you would end up cutting losses at the worst possible time and would be taking an unnecessary loss. To avoid that from happening, try setting your risk level somewhere between 2% and 8% below the nearest support. I know that's a fairly large range, but it really depends on your personal risk tolerance and the volatility of the individual stock that you're trading.

For example, you may want to give a highly volatile small cap stock a bit more wiggle room before cutting losses than a less volatile blue chip stock to avoid getting faked out. You can then use this risk level level to figure out your ideal **position size** as well. if you happen to be trading a more volatile stock and decide to set you risk level 6% below support, you'd probably be better off buying a smaller position than if you were only risking 2% below support with a more stable stock.

[https://imgur.com/a/5uRmWy1](https://imgur.com/a/5uRmWy1) 

All of these factors should really be tied together and should be a part of your trade plan that you create before you even open your position. By having a trade plan and knowing exactly what to do when the stock reaches a certain price, you can take a lot of the emotion out of your trading and focus on the price action and your strategy!

This is a huge advantage because being able to control your emotions while trading is one of the most difficult aspects of successful trading. If this is something that you struggle with, you may want to consider trying different order types to automatically cut losses for your, rather than having to manually sell your shares once the stock falls to your risk level. There are three main types of stop-loss order that will do this for you.

**1. Stop on Quote:** A stop on quote order will turn into a market order to sell your shares immediately when your selected price level is hit. For example, you set a stop on quote order at $1.79, the price falls to $1.79, and your shares are sold at the market. This means that you may not be able to sell all of your shares at $1.79 if there aren't a sufficient amount of share being bought at $1.79. In that case, the rest of your share may be sold at $1.78, $1.77, $1.76, etc.

**2. Stop Limit on Quote:** This order type type is almost identical to the stop on quote order. The only difference is that this becomes a limit order o sell your share once your price level is hit, rather than a market order. For example, you could set a quote price of $2.00 and a limit price of $1.98. In this case, if the stock price fell to $2.00 and activated your limit order, you know that your shares will be sold for at least $1.98 (if not higher). If this was a market order, you could end up selling some at $1.97, $1.96, $1.95, etc. The only downfall of a stop limit on quote order is the fact that you may not be able to sell all of your shares at your selected limited price if there isn't volume at that price to purchase your shares. For that reason, it's fairly important to give your limit order some space, rather than setting it directly below the quote price that will activate it.

**3. Trailing % Stop on Quote:** This order type is meant to protect your profits on a trade and keep you from allowing a winning trade to turn into a losing trade. With this order type you have to select a % in which you want the stock price to be trailed. If you were to put 5% and the stock went directly down after you bought, this order would turn to a stop on quote order and sell your shares at the market once the price went down 5%. However, if the stock first went up 5% before coming down 5%, you would be selling at breakeven, because the order trailed the price of the stock when it initially went up 5%. Personally, I never use this order type and recommend most traders to stick to a basic stop order to cut losses if they choose not to do it manually, because you almost have to set your trailing stop at the perfect percentage in order to really take advantage of it and not get stopped out on the stock's dips and pullbacks.

Regardless of the order type used, what's most important is that you're actively cutting losses when need be! Hopefully this post emphasizes the importance of managing risk and gave you some ideas of how you can properly do so.",2020-06-13 16:27:20

Therefore it's in your best interest to have a decent amount of exposure to them. The biggest hurdle with many small caps is getting people to pay attention. Wall street generally disregards them because there isnt enough reporting on them. They aren't well followed or well researched so this creates opportunity when it comes to mispricing. Here are some of my favorites that I'm heavily invested in. What small caps do you see becoming mid caps in a few years?

Edit: Anything under $5 (at any point in the last 6 months) is a penny stock and I just can't be a part of that (and neither should you, sincerely). Small caps are less than 2 billion in market cap but the share price is over $5. Penny stocks *always* have significant long term losses.

Xpel (XPEL)

They make automotive surface protection and grow like a SaaS company. They've doubled in the last few months and at the rate they grow there's no reason to believe they won't double again in the next year.

SiTime (SITM)

Only Company to Offer MEMS Resonators, Oscillators and Clocks to Cover Entire Timing Market. The stock price shows just how much faith people have in this company.


QuinStreet (QNST)

An online performance marketing company, provides customer acquisition services for its clients. Solid fundamentals. Solid growth. Finally recovering from a 2018 article that said to short them. The stock had quadrupled at the time so it was a prime target. They said the revenue growth was unsustainable yet they have grown revenue every year since.

Systemax (SYX)

While revenue and earnings have continued to rise, the share price has not kept up. At one point their p/e was over 100. Their forward p/e is now just 17 and their peg ratio is an even 1. Undervalued companies dont stay this way forever, just ask EBIX. 

Nexpoint Real Estate Finance (NREF)

Not to be confused with Nexpoint Residential Trust, this is one of my favorites. Barely a $100m market cap, this undiscovered gem has been performing well recently. The dividend is a whopping 8% of its share price.

Primoris Services (PRIM)

A contractor that engineers and constructs everything from solar projects to bridges to runways to pipelines. Possibly the most undervalued stock in the entire market. Bidens infrastructure plans will help these guys immensely.

Stocks fell Friday with market participants concerned at the lack of fiscal stimulus and the surge in coronavirus the last three weeks will make states reimpose restrictions that threaten to stall business activity in an already tenuous economy. An apparent dispute between the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve also weighed on the minds of market participants.

In Washington, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said during a press conference that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel (R-KY) agreed to pick back up stimulus negotiations. However, given the tenuous political situation surrounding the presidential election and the gridlock that exists in the Senate (majority for the Senate is still undecided), it is highly unlikely that any form of stimulus is passed. For months, Congress and the White House went back and forth regarding stimulus but were unable to come to an agreement. In our opinion, it is highly unlikely that additional fiscal stimulus is granted until the presidential and senate elections are resolved conclusively.

Unfortunately, the surge in coronavirus cases shows no signs of slowing down. Yesterday, the US once again set another record high for new infections, hospitalizations. According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, there were 187,800 new cases. That‚Äôs up 27% compared to last week and by far the most since the pandemic began. Data is trending in the wrong direction, with 44 out of 50 states reporting a 10% increase in new cases compared to last week. According to the COVID Tracking Project, there are around 80,700 people hospitalized with coronavirus in the US, also a new record. That‚Äôs an increase of 19.13% compared to last week. Saddest of all, there were more than 2,000 deaths due to the virus yesterday, the highest number since early May, according to Johns Hopkins University. 

In an effort to combat the surge in cases, governors from both sides of the aisle have announced a variety of new restrictions. California‚Äôs governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is ‚Äúpulling the emergency brake‚Äù on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. In Iowa, Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as ""feel-good"" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. Illinois**,** Michigan, and New Jersey announced additional restrictions that limit gatherings to household members. Indoor event spaces are also being ordered to shut-down or move outdoors. In Massachusetts, the governor announced a stay-at-home advisory. Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota are under state-wide mask mandate. These are just some of the examples, there are too many examples to list.

Despite the positive vaccine news from companies like Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA) it is important to note that it takes time to establish global distribution networks. Widespread availability of a vaccine likely won‚Äôt happen until 2021, according to the estimates of experts. In the short-term, the surge in coronavirus cases and the fear of new restriction is driving volatility.

**Highlights**

* Had a great day, closed out our BABA alert for 100% this morning.

643,"Could a Costco Special Dividend Be Coming? One Analyst Thinks Yes, at $10 a Share.",1601181186.0,"Baird analyst Peter Benedict, in a research note published Friday, said the chances of Costco (ticker: COST) paying a special dividend ‚Äúseem to be rising.‚Äù The company has paid several special dividends through the years, most recently in 2017.

Costco on Friday reported strong fiscal-fourth quarter earnings of $3.13 a share, up from $2.47 a year earlier. Benedict observed that the discount retailer has ‚Äúexcess cash on the balance sheet and fundamentals remain strong.

Benedict sees Costco paying a special dividend of around $10 a share.

The company last declared a special dividend in 2017, in that case $7 a share. It paid a special dividend of $5 a share in 2015, and one for $7 a share in 2012.

Costco CFO Richard Galanti, who was asked about a special dividend during an earnings conference call nearly a year ago, said: [T]hey are special, and so we‚Äôll have to wait and see what we decide to do in the future.‚Äù

***These securities are currently undervalued according to recent oversold trends combined with recent steady growth***

Recent reports speculated that cannabis will be a major key in the future debt crisis and fast tracking legalization is now on the table.

The cannabis sector fell an average of 15% to 30% loss Thursday while only recouping an average of 5% gain on Friday. This leaves 10% to 25% minimal returns early this week.

650,Significant Insider Trades (Last 7 Days),1590803064.0,"
This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

Trading volumes of U.S. stocks on Futu Holdings Ltd.‚Äôs app, China‚Äôs largest online trading platform for overseas equities, more than tripled in the first three months of the year after staying more or less constant in 2019, according to Citigroup Inc. estimates. It jumped again in the second quarter to $55.4 billion.

Fewer restrictions ‚Äî such as the ability to short sell (bet that a stock will fall) and looser limits on price fluctuations‚Äî have made equities traded in New York attractive even as the domestic Chinese market runs red hot. The Shanghai benchmark equity index is up about 10% this year versus the S&P 500‚Äôs 4%. The growing interest is despite China‚Äôs capital controls, which mean individuals are only allowed to take $50,000 outside the country each year. Futu doesn‚Äôt convert Renminbi for clients, meaning they already need to have foreign currency funds.

‚ÄúI think the U.S. market is more stable, because investors are more rational and there‚Äôs a longer record of history you can look at,‚Äù Zhou said from Shanghai. ‚ÄúWith Chinese stocks, there are lots of busts and bursts and irrational pricing, which makes valuation really hard.‚Äù",2020-08-16 15:33:51

657,"Here‚Äôs why the ‚Äòunloved but welcome‚Äô U.S. stock market rally from March lows won‚Äôt last, Goldman says",1591055772.0,"Brief hopes that U.S.-China trade tensions may subside appear to have been dashed.

Investors had breathed a sigh of relief on Friday when President Donald Trump [chose not to mention sanctions](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/asian-markets-rise-on-sigh-of-relief-over-trumps-response-to-china-2020-05-31?mod=article_inline) or tariffs at a press conference about China‚Äôs new security law in Hong Kong. 

However, Beijing is set to [pause purchases](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-stock-futures-turn-lower-on-report-china-pausing-soybean-purchases-2020-06-01?mod=article_inline)  of certain U.S. products, including soybeans, according to reports,  causing stock stocks to struggle at the open. Futures traders had  initially shrugged off a weekend of [protests against police killings](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/day-of-peaceful-new-york-city-marches-gives-way-to-chaos-after-dark-2020-06-01?mod=article_inline) of black people. After opening lower the Dow Jones Industrial Average   [DJIA,  0.18%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote)was 0.3% up in early trading.

Optimism over the economic recovery from coronavirus, with all 50 states taking [steps to reopen](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/im-terrified-as-the-us-begins-to-reopen-one-small-business-owner-prepares-for-a-dicey-summer-2020-05-26?mod=article_inline), has sent stocks higher in recent weeks.

In **our call of the day**, Goldman Sachs analysts said the ‚Äúunloved but welcome‚Äù S&P 500 [SPX, 0.17%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote)rally over the past two months was unlikely to persist.

The S&P 500 has rebounded more than 35% since its Mar. 23  low and now trades 10% below its all-time high. The rally, after stocks  plunged 34% in just 23 trading days, was unloved because investors  weren‚Äôt positioned to take full advantage, but welcome because most  investors are structurally long-biased, the analysts, led by David  Kostin, said.

They described it as a ‚Äúremarkable journey‚Äù but said the upward trajectory of U.S. stocks would most likely stop.

The equity research analyst‚Äôs year-end target remains 3,000 ‚Äî  slightly lower than the index‚Äôs 3,044 close on Friday ‚Äî as ‚Äúnumerous  medical, economic and political risks dot the investment landscape.‚Äù

If the expected ‚Äúachievable but optimistic‚Äù normalization of  the economy is met that would validate the existing market level, rather  than push it substantially higher, they concluded.

In the near-term, the index could move to 3,200 but any bumps  in the road to economic reopening or further political risks could send  the index to 2,750, they said.

666,The Fischer Random Chess Stock Market,1595750980.0,"by [Vitaliy Katsenelson](https://contrarianedge.com/the-fischer-random-chess-stock-market/)

I grew up in Russia, where chess was a spectator sport. Chess is almost as old as the New Testament and has only gone through minor changes over its long history. Chess has the longest recorded history of any sport ‚Äì you can study the first recorded game, played in Valencia, Spain in 1475. [The game](http://www.scachsdamor.org/), which was called ‚ÄúScachs d‚ÄôAmor‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Chess Game of Love‚Äù) by those who played and recorded it, comes to us in the form of a poem comprising 64 stanzas of 9 lines each.

Any player who takes chess seriously will carefully study every move in the tens of thousands of games played by grandmasters over the last six hundred years of recorded chess history. Chess players study opening systems ‚Äì the series of first moves (five to fifteen in number) early in the game that lead to the middle-game formation of pieces. They study opening systems to the point that the early part of the game requires very little thinking; it is quite mechanical ‚Äì you execute openings that you‚Äôve studied day and night and thoroughly memorized. As the game leaves its opening phase and goes into middle- and then end-game stages, raw thinking becomes more and more important.

Enter Fischer random chess, which was popularized by the eccentric American world chess champion Bobby Fischer in 1996. It is the same as the traditional game, except that the first rank, the standard opening arrangement of kings, queens, bishops, knights, and rooks, is randomly reshuffled (symmetrically for white and black) every game. The second rank, where the pawns open the game, is untouched. The rules, objectives, and strategies are the same ‚Äì you want to control the center; your pieces need to protect each other; your king has to be protected at all times; and the goal is the same: kill the other king.

The beauty and the difficulty of Fischer random is that memorization of the opening system is completely useless ‚Äì there are 960 variations of starting positions for your army (this is why this game is also called Chess960). You cannot make an automatic move like pawn E2 to E4, because the piece behind it may not be a king but a rook. Studying the middle and end games still has tremendous value.

There is a parallel between today‚Äôs stock market and Fischer random chess. The last time we faced a global pandemic was in 1918, and this might as well have been in the BC era. Few of us were alive then, but even the history books are not that useful, as the structure of the US and global economy, the central bank system, the diversity and dynamism of society, and the state of technological progress are nothing like the world knew then. Most of the mental models we as investors rely on are based on an environment that no longer exists. The only common denominator between now and then is that humans have not really changed that much ‚Äì it takes a few millennia to rewire our DNA and thus our fundamental behavior.

I look at my thinking from a few months ago ‚Äì which seems like it was a decade ago ‚Äì and realize it was na√Øve. In the initial shock of pandemic, I did not realize that I was using the playbook (opening moves) for a traditional recession as we approached our investment decisions. We were playing the wrong game.

We need to confront this environment on its own unique terms: we have never been here before. We have to incredibly careful not to fall back on using old mental models. With every move we make, we have to reexamine our assumptions.

Let me give you this example. As the economy reopens and we come back to work, a lot of people won‚Äôt return to their offices. Many companies have already announced that they will expand WFH (work from home). This means people will commute less ‚Ä¶ and the demand for cars and gasoline may be very different.

I visited Russia in 2008 for the first time since leaving it in 1991, and I discovered something interesting: When people talk, the distance they maintain between each other is much shorter than in the US. Americans keep at least two or three feet between them. Russians are comfortable with one foot. I (being Americanized at this point) found myself slightly uncomfortable being in such close proximity to friends I talked to, and I kept stepping back. It did not take me long to realize why social distance in conversation is different in Russia. Despite Russia‚Äôs enormous size, public transportation is always packed, elevators are tiny, and apartments are cramped. This built environment has shaped how people interact socially.

Will this pandemic permanently reshape distancing requirements for us ‚Äì will two feet turn into four or six feet? Over the last few decades the airlines, trying to lower their costs, increased the number of seats on planes and thus shrank the distance between passengers. Will they have to rewind the clock and make seating more spacious again? If they do, ticket prices will have to go up, and may go up a lot, since airlines‚Äô operating costs will not decline; they will only go up. Higher ticket prices may reshape air travel. Flying may turn into a luxury item again. You‚Äôll have fewer planes flying. Businesses may substitute Zoom calls for travel. You‚Äôll need fewer planes and fewer hotel rooms. Thus, if you are in the business of making flying buses (planes), your industry might go from 4-5% forever growth ‚Äì this was the expectation as people in emerging markets became wealthier and started travelling ‚Äì into a glacial decline.

In 2008 ‚Äì despite the magnitude of the recession ‚Äì we did not have to think about such fundamental shifts. I am not sure whether the travel industry will change this profoundly, but there is not a zero probability that this scenario will be our reality, all because of a microbe we cannot see.

As time passes and we enter into the middlegame, we‚Äôll have a lot more clarity. We‚Äôll get more familiar with our position on the board with game pieces like vaccines and cures, and the old normal may more or less resume. But today we have to face the fact that we are playing Fischer Random chess and must weigh our moves both carefully and creatively.

As we look today at the global economy, the potential outcomes are very wide. We‚Äôve taken a position of hoping for the best but investing for the worst.

Stocks rose today, reversing course after being deep in the red the last two days. Market participants digested a record increase in third-quarter GDP for the US, a better-than-expected weekly unemployment report, new coronavirus restrictions in the US and Europe and a slew of corporate earnings for massive companies.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.75% today, the best performing of the major indices. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.05% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.44%.

After coming off one of the worst quarters in US history, the economy rebounded, growing at its fastest pace ever. Gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the total goods and services produced from July to September of this year, expanded at a 33.1% annualized pace, according to the report by the Department of Commerce. The gain came after a 31.4% plunge in the second quarter and was better than the 32% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The previous record was the post-World War II 16.7% surge in the first quarter of 1950.

Today, the US Department of Commerce released its weekly unemployment report, showing that another 751,000 individuals filed initial jobless claims, better than the 770,000 estimated by analysts.  Continuing claims, which refer to individuals that are currently receiving unemployment benefits who filed for unemployment benefits at least two weeks ago, was 7.75 million, slightly better than the 7.77 million expected. According to Yahoo Finance, this report represents the ninth-straight week initial unemployment claims have remained below 1 million and continuing claims below 10 million, a key indicator that the economy is recovering, though not as fast as many would like.

In Europe, countries are still struggling to contain the recent surge in coronavirus infections. Both France and Germany announced renewed lockdowns spanning for about the next month, though the restrictions stopped short of the draconian measures announced earlier on during the pandemic. In the US, the seven-day average of daily new cases rose to a record 70,000 as of yesterday, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.

On the vaccine front, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation‚Äôs top infectious-disease expert, said he believed it would take until at least January for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine. There are five companies (Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (ELY), and BioNTech (BNTX)) in the final stages of study for a coronavirus vaccine, with Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. having fully enrolled their trials, Fauci said.

Some analysts consider the recent pull-back in the stock market a healthy inevitability, given the strong rally that took many stocks to all-time highs earlier in the Month. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients, ‚ÄúMarkets have been baking in a lot of optimism: that the pandemic was under control, that the economy was healing, and that things would be back to something approaching normal in 2021. Those assumptions were always optimistic, though, and what we are seeing now is a reality-based repricing. As such, this drop is both necessary and healthy. Markets should reflect the most likely future path, not the most optimistic, and that is where we are headed.‚Äù

678,Take advantage of the overreaction!,1596691367.0,"The recent dip in Intel (INTC) is an overreaction and provides an excellent price for a tech beast that boasts strong growth and good dividend.

While Intel did announce the 7nm delay of 6-12 months, a hiccup, it also announced it is willing to go to TSMC if TSMC has the better technology at the time; Intel will use the best process technology available. So if taking these words on face value, then AMD at no point going forward will have an advantage (in manufacturing technology): they both have access to TSMC, and Intel also has access to its own process and packaging technology. 

There is more to semiconductor products than the manufacturing technology. The IP still has to be developed. For example, while AMD has moved to N7 for some time for its GPUs, it still does not have something like Nvidia‚Äôs Tensor (or Ray Tracing) Cores that would make it competitive for AI workloads, which is fueling Nvidia‚Äôs growth in the data center. So while process technology can be a differentiator, so can a product‚Äôs architecture be. 

Concerning manufacturing technology, there is much more to it than just transistor density. For example, Intel said it intends to improve 10nm by one Moore's Law by improving it through 10nm+(+)(+) introductions. So Intel might have lower density, but power and performance of the transistors could be similar to AMD's (or its 7nm). Intel could very realistically launch/manufacture 7nm products or IP on 10nm++(+) instead. 

For investors, keeping track of all of this technology might be unrealistic. To that end, I would propose the following view: I see nothing fundamentally changing as to Intel remaining the leading CPU company (by size - financials - market share), while AMD will remain relatively tiny.

**TLDR**: AMD is on a hot streak but stepping back and looking big picture as an investor and not a tech geek will help you made the right choice and see the opportunity we have with INTC current price. INTC is more than a product launch.",2020-08-05 22:22:47

However, if you are piling into cheap stock for the sake of them being below their ATH's you might want to show some caution. I think sooner or later you will get badly burnt.

Everyone is at home with time on their hands and a trading terminal in their pocket. This is fueling the fire and pushing the market up and up. This is not to say that it cannot continue higher from here, that's what bubbles do, they expand, sucking, even more, suckers in. If there is not a major news catalyst this may even drive us back to ATH's. But the further the market loses touch with reality the more violent correction we are instore for and a lot of first-time investors will lose a ton of cash.

**You can check out the tool at** [**Quikfo.com/app**](https://quikfo.com/app)**.**

For a little background on me, I'm a student studying computer science and am set to graduate this Spring, and this has been a project of mine for the last couple of years.  Last year, my thesis project focused on predicting stock price movement by using a subset of machine-learning called Naive Bayes.  The goal was to classify companies based on their prevalent diction across social media posts and news articles in ways that would correlate with upcoming performance.  The system which I created for that project is actually running to this day (and doing quite well) and is a micro-service within the overlying Quikfo system -- if you create a Quikfo account and subscribe to the 'Bullish Sentiment Indicators' interest then you will get up to date results from that system sent to your inbox daily.

Some interesting details about the project:

* There are currently 81 active users
* Quikfo currently processes 70 unique \`interests\`.   These interests can be used to create daily email newsletters tailored for each user
* Our 81 users have over 200 active interest subscriptions
* Quikfo has collected almost 23,000,000 social media posts
* Quikfo has collected over 900,000 news articles
* Quikfo follows about 3000 different publicly traded companies and a few crypto currencies

I've taken some snapshots of the tool in action below to provide you with some insight into how this app might help you and your financial research.

When you search a company on the Quikfo app you'll first see a basic table of fundamental metrics:  [https://i.gyazo.com/0f8e11fca465f98983287681f890b2ac.png](https://i.gyazo.com/0f8e11fca465f98983287681f890b2ac.png)

These fundamental metrics will be broken down into industry wide percentile rankings for easy contextualization:  [https://i.gyazo.com/7c2479bd6839c1783d7216b68c5eb29e.png](https://i.gyazo.com/7c2479bd6839c1783d7216b68c5eb29e.png)

Bar charts are available which depict the level of ""volume"" across news and social media -- this is meant to quantify the attention being paid to a given company:  [https://i.gyazo.com/b5e85165d5a03677600431a4c82beaaa.png](https://i.gyazo.com/b5e85165d5a03677600431a4c82beaaa.png)

687,"I draw with crayons so you don't have to. The grind up continues. Tickers on the watchlist this week: CRSR, APPS, PINS, DKNG, SNOW",1610950177.0,"**What am I doing?**

I do technical analysis and selling cash-secured-puts 3 to 5 weeks out on stocks that are nearing key levels of support. My goal is to collect premium, but should I get assigned I have absolutely zero problem running the wheel on stocks I want to own.

I watch over 200 stocks, I would say its 90% waiting game and 10% true technical analysis. My levels work, but it's normally because I am patiently waiting for an entry point. Yes that's a lot of tickers to watch, but I research my stocks on weekends and then monitor additional plays & levels during the weekday to see if there is an obvious setup I want to participate in.

**Here's a few things regarding my strategy**

**1.** I don't over-leverage with selling multiple spreads because if the stock price blows past your long strike and you assume max loss you need a lot of capital to actually be assigned the shares. For that reason I don't really see selling multiple spreads as a ""Theta Gang"" play and is still very high risk. If I do open a spread it will be a protective put for $1-5 just to protect myself should the company randomly announce bankruptcy.

**2.** I only sell cash-secured puts with the capability to be assigned if need be. My goal is to never take a loss on a position and always wheel it back to profitability. If something has changed fundamentally with the stock then yes I will close the position and realize the loss.

**3.** If IV on a ticker is very low, then yes I will outright buy shares instead.

**4.** I only aim for 1-4% per week collecting on theta and an occasional earnings theta yolo. No call-buying, no spreads (unless buying a covered put), only put-selling and shares!

Honestly, that's about it. I'll go through some tickers on my watchlist this weekend and what I currently have open.

# Open Positions From Last Week

I closed up some positions Thursday before close¬†and raised cash which gave me an opportunity to open new positions when some good entries came about Friday on the dip. Still about 40% cash and will look to enter some trades on Tuesday.  


Positions that remain from previous weeks: **COTY, FEYE, GME, JMIA, PLTR**.  
Positions I opened Friday: **CRSR, RKT**

# Chart Rules

**Pink Lines** = Trading range & channel. I find stocks typically trade within certain channels until an event, such as earnings or some news which changes the fundamentals of the stock price changes the trend and a new channel is formed.

**Blue Lines** = Key areas of support/resistance. I don't like focusing on supp/res levels every $2 down like some people do. I look at the bigger picture and find where where key levels of buyers come in to grab the stock. I'll try to sell puts there.

# Master Plays This Week

I just want to preface this by saying these are not recommendations to buy or sell any stocks. These are stocks that have come through my scanner and met a few criteria for me to sell puts to collect premium. I won't execute on every trade, but if the timing is right I will enter these, that's why they are on my ""watchlist"". My intention here is to sell the put, collect the premium, or get assigned the shares. If I am assigned the shares, I sell covered-calls trying to lower my cost basis and remain profitable on the play.

&#x200B;

**CRSR ($38)**

[CRSR chart](https://imgur.com/52ZHUcf)

This ticker finds it's way on my short-list of stocks once again. The channel it's trading in is pretty clear and each break-out at the $42 level gets rejected. If we continue to go¬†down expect some support at $35.50. IMO I don't think it will break through for it to¬†become a downward trend. I'm comfortable selling puts at $35¬†for February 15 going into the earnings report around then.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $35 strike puts sold to open for $3.30 or $330 premium. Return: 10%.  
**Break-even:** I lose if share price goes below $31.70 (20% drop from current level) by expiration.

&#x200B;

**APPS ($56)**

[APPS chart](https://imgur.com/K8fnWOS)

APPS nearing the mid-way point of the strong upward channel it's been in. I wouldn't be surprised if it begins to trade sideways and consolidates after the share price doubled since November. Earnings are also coming up relatively soon. I will sell the put the week after earnings anticipating a period of consolidation and sideways action before the next move higher and maybe a run going into earnings day.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $50 strike puts sold to open for $3.75 or $375 premium. Return: 7.5%  
**Break-even:** $46.25

&#x200B;

**PINS ($69)**

[PINS chart](https://imgur.com/D4gScC1)

Finally an entry point into PINS. This ticker really took off over last summer and into the fall, but since December it's been pretty flat. It's right on the $70 level of supp/resistance. If this level breaks down we could see it go back to $65 area. I'll be confident selling my puts at $66 for the week after earnings in mid February. This will give me plenty of time should the stock consolidate or if we get one more push higher going into earnings.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $65 strike puts sold to open for $5.40 or $540 premium. Return: 8.5%.  
**Break-even:** $59.50

&#x200B;

**DKNG ($53)**

[DKNG chart](https://imgur.com/DExQG41)

DKNG isn't my favorite to sell puts on because IV isn't as high¬†for the return I could get, but it's been fairly reliable in terms of how it trades. Trend lines on this chart are going back to May instead of just the last 2-3 months. Like clockwork it's stayed within the channel for several 6 now. It is at the top of the channel, but could be due for a breakout if it follows¬†the lead of PENN. Government will be looking for revenues and one of the easiest ways to do this moving forward will be to legalize sports-betting everywhere they can and tax the hell out of it. I am bullish long-term on this industry and really don't mind being assigned shares. I might sell closer to ATM puts here 5 weeks out and try to get an extra kick in premium.

**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $50 strike puts sold to open for $2.65 or $265. Return: 5.3%.  
**Break-even:** $47.35

&#x200B;

**SNOW ($290)**

[SNOW chart](https://imgur.com/1QC1mJ8)

I always liked SNOW, but never got in due to concerns of valuation. For the price action it was experiencing post IPO it also never really had enticing IVs to sell puts against either, which was somewhat strange. Now that the swings in share price the stock¬†is experiencing are narrowing IMO it could be a good time to sell puts with a long-term mindset. This would enable me¬†to get in on some shares at a good price should I¬†be assigned.

  
**Positions on the watchlist**

**1.** Feb 19, 2021 $275 strike put sold to open for $17.00 or $1,700 premium. Return: 6.2%  
**Break-even:** $258",2021-01-17 23:09:37
688,How do you handle big losses? (mentally),1594357365.0,"Hey guys, newbie to subreddit here,

Picked up light day trading a few weeks ago, first using 500, then 1500, then eventually putting in 3.5k euros.

I used the site  plus500 which gives me leverage, but is of course risky as hell. It started out good with me getting 50 to several hundred euros profit a week. I made good rational choices and it paid off. Then I started using more money, and was stupid enough not to diversify.

I opened a position on a UK top 100 call which had a fairly large spread on it, making me start out with a badly losing position. With my limited understanding it looked like I bought in at a good position, but boy was I wrong...

Within days the position started falling, falling, and falling. I kept it up and even bought more positions on the way down thinking it would come around. Wrong again.

Eventually it dropped to less then 1/4th and my positions were all closed. I lost all of it. As a uni student my goal was of course to make some money by using money I had saved up, and the prospect of losing it was pretty maddening. Couldn't even think straight for a couple days.

I wanna stress that my goal isn't to write a sob story, but I'm genuinely curious if anyone here has been in a position like this, or how you guys handle big losses mentally. I can't imagine there being many other situations where you can lose everything so quickly, just from home and being notified by an app notification. Seems surreal.

Funny enough it actually felt petty good writing this all down. One way of coping with it I guess. Please do share if you've had anything similar happen, or just anything else to say :)

Ps: sorry for the wall of text.

EDIT: Didn't expect to get this many replies. Thanks for all the stories and advice. I'll take them to heart as best I can.",2020-07-09 22:02:45

(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) beat Wall Street estimates for annual vehicle deliveries and met the low-end of its own target, sending shares to a record high in a vindication for Chief Executive Elon Musk after a few turbulent years.

690,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 30, 2020",1604117221.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 30, 2020**

The stock market fell sharply today, erasing yesterday‚Äôs gains to close out one of the worst weeks and worst month since March. Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.

Yesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterday‚Äôs issue of the daily recap. 

Today, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that ‚Äúfees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans‚Äù. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.

Unfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.

Europe is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by ‚Äúabout a third‚Äù and daily deaths by ‚Äúclose to 40%‚Äù this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Today is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, it‚Äôll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.

**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY

**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market

###**FAQs:**

**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**

**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.

**2) Should I invest now or later?**

**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP

**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**

**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.

**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**

**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.

#**Blackberry Analysis Regarding Infotainment and Google and Ford Deal:**

see ""Blackberry (BB) Stock News Analysis | What I need to say..."" by Financial Live by LEYA on the forbidden video website

--> The media recently picked out a story that left out a lot of pertinent information, making it seems that BB lost Ford as a client. This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX

#**Facebook Settlement with BB**

[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)

This is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS

https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20

Well, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.

#**Blackberry New Partnerships**

Within the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.

#**Rumor: Blackberry Buyout? Here's why that's not happening:**

Just read this post. It's quite revealing:

[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)

**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.

#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**

Alright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:

[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)

For one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.

As for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)

#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**

Blackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

#**Really, no competitors?**

Well it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.

#**Conclusion:**

All eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.

Initially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...

701,When to sell a stock,1591826151.0,"When to sell a stock

DISCLAIMER- this article is for long term investors ONLY, if you're a day trader, you might not be much value from it. 

Selling a stock is a tricky thing to do. If you sell it too early you might miss multi bagger returns just for a 10% profit. But if you wait for too long your 30% profit will become a giant loss. This is a common problem faced by majority of the investors out there. The ideal answer is to never sell a stock but we both know that doesn‚Äôt work in the real world. About a year ago I was making a killer profit on BEL. This was a really good trade that I‚Äôd made. I could have exited the stock with a nice profit but I got greedy I held on to the stock for a long time and soon enough things turned sour. My profit went down. I waited until the price came back to my original target but the stock fell.

My lower profits were soon vanished. I‚Äôd just broken even. Now my only desire was to make a little profit but soon enough I went in the red territory. The stock fell down for no apparent reason I lost money. I could have taken a loss and moved on but I just wanted to break even. So I waited but again the stock went further down and hit my stop-loss. I went from a winning double digit return profit to a negative trade in a short period of time.

I could have exited at any point. But I didn‚Äôt because back then I had no idea when to sell a stock. Selling a stock is really tricky.

Ôøº

Another time I had purchased shares of a company and the stock went down within a few days. I quickly sold my shares because I didn‚Äôt want to take the loss. But later the same stock went up at least 35% in less than a year. I felt stupid for selling too early.

Once I saw a company trading at 230 rupees, something like that. I decided that whenever the stock hit 220 rupees I‚Äôd buy it. The stock went down to 226 but then it rose, it rose like a fucking space shuttle. The stock then went from 230 to 600 in less than a year. A true missed opportunity. The opportunity cost was huge. I lost a multi bagger just to save a few bucks!

After the third incident I learnt a crucial lesson- Selling at the right price (and time) is vital yet extremely difficult.

The example mentioned earlier in the book about Rakesh Jhunjhunwala is an example of extreme patience. Rakesh J bought Titan Company‚Äôs shares at just 3 rupees. He had a chance to sell them at 6 rupees and double his money. He didn‚Äôt. he had a chance to sell them at 30 and make 10x returns. But he didn‚Äôt. most of us would have sold our shares at 10 rupees or around that range. But the ones who wouldn‚Äôt sell it at 10 would‚Äôve sold the shares at 100 or 200. Holding a stock which is up 10x or 100x is extremely difficult.

The moment the stock falls from 120 to 90 and you 4,000% return goes to ‚Äújust‚Äù 30x it feels bad. We feel an urge to sell it before it goes down any further. But the same stock went to 200 and then to 500 and finally above 1,000. Rakesh Jhunjhunwala made 400x more money on his trade and he still holds a significant amount of shares of Titan even though the stock fell from 1200 to 1000.

¬†

So when should you sell you shares?

There are 7 situations I could think of when it would make sense to sell your stake in a winning or a losing trade.

Valuation Level Sell.

We‚Äôve talked about valuation and how to find the intrinsic value of a stock and buy it below the intrinsic value. This way we limit our downside but what about the upside? In this method we sell a stock after it has hit a certain valuation. How do we find out the valuation? Through valuation ratios and market capitalization of the company.

Market capitalization. Every company has a market capitalization and there is a ceiling to the market cap of a company. The price of 1 share is 1,000 rupees and the total number of shares is 1000, the market capitalization of the company is 1000√ó1000= 1 million rupees. A lot of time value investors buy companies with a fixed exit. For example they buy a company at a specific market cap amount so if they enter a stock when the company‚Äôs market cap is 10,000 crores they plan to sell it at a market cap of 50,000 crores because they believe that the company won‚Äôt grow much after that. This is not the best strategy as it is almost impossible to predict when (if at all) the company will hit a specific market cap. So I don‚Äôt really use this strategy.

¬†

P/E ratio. Every company has a P/E ratio unless the earnings are negative. So the plan is to buy a company at a low P/E ratio and sell it when the P/E is relatively higher than the industry P/E. if you buy a stock at the P/E of 17 when the industry P/E is 21 and 4 years later the stock‚Äôs P/E goes up to 38 when the industry P/E is 29, this might be a chance to sell the stock because it is severely overvalued. You‚Äôll have to factor in the other factors too such as the P/S ratio, the P/BV ratio, the charts, etc and if the company is still overvalued by 30% or more you can plan an exit with a whopping profit.

Opportunity Cost Sell.

If you hold a few thousand shares of a company for 5 years and there is no significant movement in the price, for example you buy Power Grid at 196 and the price after 5 years is 203 or 180, this is a very small movement for a period of 5 years. Then you might consider selling that stock to find a newer, better one. But beware that the price after 5 years may be 203 or 180 but if the high and low the price in that period is 90 and 350, you might want to reconsider your thought.

If you hold a loss making stock for 5 long years think of all the time and money you‚Äôve wasted. In these 5 years you could have booked a small (or a big) loss and invested that amount into a better company and covered that loss. Some people agree on selling a low return stock and investing that amount into a higher return stock to cover the opportunity cost. This way he could have risked a minimum downside for a major upside.

Constant switching between companies adds up to high transaction cost and higher payment of taxes (STCG)

¬†

Deteriorating fundamentals sell.

A lot of times we buy a fundamentally strong company at an attractive price but over the course of 5 years or so the fundamentals become weak. The company undergoes major changes like change in the management or it acquires a lot of unnecessary companies which rises the debt level or the industry undergoes a major shift and the company becomes a dinosaur. Anything can happen which can make a company weaker. DHFL was a strong company a few years ago. It was at 600-700 rupees and then it suddenly fell to 250 and the stock is trading at just 20 rupees! That‚Äôs a major fall. The company has a poor management and the debt has skyrocketed! This once good company is down to its knees.

If you had invested in it at 200 levels it would have gone to 691 but then I would have fallen down to 20 rupees and you would have lost 90% of your capital.

Fundamentals change. The companies that were once strong can become weak. Yes Bank is another example. This company was strong priced at 350 rupees and it fell to 30 rupees in less than two years. Sometimes you may buy a wonderful company but over time that wonderful company doesn‚Äôt stay wonderful.

You should regularly check your investments. I recommend going over you portfolio at least twice a year. An amazing fact is that majority of the Fortune500 companies in the 1950s and the 60s don‚Äôt exist anymore. So even the biggest, strongest and the most powerful companies can fall over time.

In the picture below you can see that the intrinsic value of the stock was 80 rupees and the market price was 60 rupees. So if you though that it was undervalued and bought it, it would have been a big mistake. The company performed so poor that the intrinsic value fell to a price below the market price and a new intrinsic value was calculated. Falling fundamentals is a giant threat to your strategy.

Might be a good strategy to limit losses, not really for profiting.

down from cost and up from cost sale.

This is a technique used by amateurs in investing. It simply means that selling a stock when it is up or down certain % from your buying price. This is a very common approach and apparently it works.

For example you buy a company at 250 rupees and decide that you will sell the stock when you make a 30% profit or a 10% loss. Those are the two possibilities you need to look for. So if the stock goes up 30% i.e. to 325 you sell it or if the stock goes down to 225 (10%) you sell it. This way you‚Äôll know when to exit a stock and you‚Äôll not face too much risk. The moment you make a 10% loss you‚Äôll be out and the moment you make a 30% profit you‚Äôll be out. So your profits will not drag down into losses and your downside will be limited. This is actually a pretty good strategy. The only downside to this strategy is that you will lose the potential upside too. You‚Äôll protect the downside but miss the potential upside.

What if you book a profit at 30% and the stock goes up 300%? You‚Äôll miss it. But isn‚Äôt protecting the downside more important than gaining the upside?

Force sell.

This is a bad reason to sell a stock. Imagine that you invested 10 lac rupees and 18 years later it turns into 50 lacs. You now have increased your money almost 3x in 18 years. That‚Äôs impressive.

But what if you want to buy a new house or pay for your kid‚Äôs college? You can simply sell your shares and buy the things you need. This strategy talks about selling your shares to buy something.

Target Price Sell.

This is the most advanced type of exit from a company. Let‚Äôs assume that you buy a stock at 100 rupees and your set a stop-loss at 90 the target at 140. That‚Äôs a 1:4 risk reward ratio. Unlike the forth strategy you consider more factors and set a pre decided set price (not percentage).

So if your stock goes up to 140 and the stock P/E rose from 17 to 19 but the industry P/E is 21, you don‚Äôt sell your shares. Instead you set a new target and a higher stop-loss. You can even use a trailing stop-loss. So your new stop-loss and target prices will be 126 and 211 respectively. Then if the stock rises to 211 and the P/E is still not overvalued you can hold it and set a new target and stop-loss. But if the price reaches 200 and the stock‚Äôs P/E rises to 25 while the industry‚Äôs P/E is still 21 you can consider selling it.

You can also look at the charts of the company (daily or weekly time frame) and decide. If there is a resistance coming up soon you can sell it after testing the resistance and place a stop-loss below the support and hope for an upward breakout. If the stock is going in an uptrend you can use 50 day SMA along with 250 day SMA as support and use Fibonacci retracements to find new targets and resistance levels.

This method of investing is definitely more complicated than the other methods but this provides the maximum upside with the limited downside. The other methods lack either of the two factors.

Limited riskLimited (but higher) return

¬†

The Never Sell strategy.

Warren Buffet recommends this. He tells us to buy amazing companies at awesome prices and never sell the shares, but following this blindly can be catastrophic. You have the maximum downside in this strategy but the upside too is maximum, this is what makes this strategy the high risk, high reward strategy.

You can acquire potential multi baggers through this strategy but you can also lose it all through this strategy. It is dangerous. Even Warren Buffett sells his shares regularly.

Unlimited riskUnlimited return

¬†

Here‚Äôs how to use this strategy in the best way possible. You find an amazing company and buy it below its intrinsic value. Let‚Äôs say that you buy 100 shares of this company at 100 rupees and the company pays 6% dividend every year. The stock rises to 160 in 6 years (10% annual growth). What should you do?

Here‚Äôs a possible answer- since you‚Äôve bought the shares at 100 and the company grows at 10% per year and pays 6% dividends every year you accumulate 4610 rupees as dividends.

2014- 100 rupees @6%= 6 rupees x 100

2015- 110 rupees @6%= 6.6 rupees x 100

2016- 121 rupees @6%= 7.2 rupees x 100

2017- 133 rupees @6%= 8 rupees x 100

2018- 146 rupees @6%= 8.7 rupees x 100

2019- 160 rupees @6%= 9.6 rupees x 100

So the addition of the dividends is 4610 rupees over the course of 6 years. And the capital appreciation is 6000 rupees (160√ó100 ‚Äì 100√ó100). So what you can do is sell those 6000 rupees worth of shares which amounts to 37 shares.

Sell 37 shares and your amount from capital gains and dividends will be equal to 10,610 rupees which is 6.1% more than your invested capital. Keep the remaining shares as they are i.e. hold them as long as you can (the company must be fundamentally strong).

So basically you‚Äôve gotten back your entire invested amount with a 6.1% gain and the remaining is free floating shares for holding forever. You‚Äôll have 63 shares of the company. Hold them forever and reinvest the dividends. After splits, bonuses and reinvesting dividends you‚Äôll have a significant holding in the company which will multiply after each split and bonus. The 6% dividends will give you a decent amount of yearly income and you‚Äôll have no risk as the investment has already paid for itself.

So even if things go sour you won‚Äôt lose money as your capital has already been covered. Everything above that price is pure profit.

No risk (after recovery)Unlimited returns

¬†

Of course this strategy is made super simple and taxes, inflation and other charges aren‚Äôt taken into consideration but overall this was just to give you a fair idea on how you can eliminate risk after a few years and earn pure profit. This strategy is difficult as you need a company with strong fundamentals at an attractive price which provides regular dividends (or increases a lot in value) and stays amazing for a long period of time. Wipro and Infosys are prime examples of this type of companies. These companies have made massive amount of wealth to investors who got in early. This strategy might have worked like a magic in these companies. Speaking of magic we‚Äôll soon discover the magic formula of investing.

So these were the 7 reasons to sell a stock. Now I hope that you have a fairly good idea on when you should sell a stock. This doesn‚Äôt guarantee you that you‚Äôll always have the lowest downside with the highest upside but it‚Äôll give you a small edge. And that small edge makes all the difference.",2020-06-10 14:55:51

711,Printing money to counter recession have been EU and sadly... It doesn't look well,1590961597.0,"Hi I've studied econometrics (Macro economy) in Sweden (a welfare state who regularly do what the fed's  currently's doing) and I'm at the moment employed at the statistical Central bureau of Sweden where we keep past economic data.

Sweden's tactic to help the Economy usually consists of printing money and increasing well fair spending (Health care, school, highway's etc) in recession to create more jobs and the opposite in economic booms to make the recession less bad. So we have a good track record of how printing money affects the economy.

Sadly for you U.S. citizens, printing money won't save the economy. Merly ease the crash landing that's about to come.

Think of it like this. The U.S economy is like a water balloon, when times are good people take out credit loans and spend (filling the balloon with water) until it becomes so big that holes appear so water rush out (recession).

What's currently happening is that Corona is slowly creating holes in the balloon as it spreads (Job loss). The Fed tried to counter this by filling the balloon with water (printing money). But no matter how fast the fed will try to fill the balloon, the water will rush out of the holes (That keep forming!) Faster than they can keep the money printing up.

The only way to fix the balloon, is by covering the holes. (A Corona virus cure) And sadly, no matter what the media tries to convey, the average vaccine takes 10 years to produce. This can barely be speed up with more funding since one must take time to observe what the vaccine does to your body before it can be released to the public. If you Google on interviews with medical professionals, most claim that due to the massive funding and focuse on the vaccine, a working cure with no side effects is at best 5 years away or 3 years away with side effects.
The 1,5 years away is IF we manage to convert an existing similar vaccine AND absolutely nothing goes wrong in any of the 3 vaccine stages. Which is if you haven't already guessed it. Almost impossible.

In conclusion : 
For those of you that think that the fed can print their way out of this recession, I'm sad to say that it can't be done. Many EU countries such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Germany have tried it. What happens is that most people simply save the money due to bad times. Meaning that since they don't spend it, there's barely any new jobs created.
The best the money printing can do is to make the recession less worse than it could have been.

Hope you all keep safe in these troubling times.",2020-05-31 14:46:37

Stocks traded roughly even today, with a significant dip near the middle of the day, as market participants continue to focus on the policy implications of the incoming Democratic administration and the consequences of last week‚Äôs riots at the Capitol. 

After the Democrat‚Äôs election victory in the White House and Senate, market participants are trying to assess the path forward for the market. Under the unified government, the passage of additional stimulus to combat the still-surging pandemic is likely. Analysts at Credit Suisse have set a 4,100 target for the S&P 500, implying around 10% upside in 2021. However, in the near-term, a number of analysts expect volatility in the market. ClearBridge Investment Strategist told Yahoo Finance, ‚ÄúI think the markets are a little extended,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if you saw a little consolidation here over the next couple of weeks, somewhere in the 5% range. But I do think that this is going to be a buying opportunity for a ... very strong economic growth picture you‚Äôre going to see in 2021.‚Äù

Today, in response to the riot at the Capitol last week by supporters of Trump, the US House of Representatives are initiating impeachment proceedings and are calling on Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th amendment to remove Trump from office. Invoking the 25th Amendment would allow Pence and a majority of the Cabinet to vote to remove Trump from office due to his inability to ""discharge the powers and duties of his office"" -- an unprecedented step. Pence has so far given no indication that he would take that action. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called on Pence to respond within ‚Äú24 hours‚Äù. In the impeachment resolution, likely to be discussed tomorrow, Trump is accused of ‚Äúinciting an insurrection.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe have to be very tough and very strong right now in defending the Constitution and democracy,‚Äù said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., an author of both pieces of legislation, in an interview.

Shares of internet companies continue to be under pressure following reports that many of these companies, including Facebook (FB), Snapchat (SNAP) and Twitter (TWTR) banned President Donald Trump‚Äôs account. Over the weekend, Twitter permanently banned Trump from their platform, saying in a statement ‚ÄúAfter close review of recent Tweets from the realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence.‚Äù Apple (AAPL) and Google removed conservative social media platform Parler from their respective platforms, citing inadequate content moderation policies and Amazon (AMZN) said it would no longer host Parler on its web hosting services. In response, Parler sued Amazon, alleging that Amazon Web Services kicked the company off its cloud servers for political and anti-competitive reasons. As of now, Parler remains offline.

Losses in the stock market accelerated today as market participants nervously eyed rising coronavirus case counts in the US and Europe, the presidential election a mere 6 days away, and developments out of Washington regarding stimulus.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) slid 3.90$ down, the S&P 500 (SPY) fell 3.41%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 3.35%.

In the United States, there were 73,240 coronavirus cases reported yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University. Alarmingly, the average number of daily new cases in the US rose  21% compared to the previous week. According to an article from CNN Health, the surge is hitting all parts of the country, with 40 states reporting at least a 10% increase in daily average cases, compared to last week. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said, ‚ÄúCases are rising quickly. If we go back about six, seven weeks ago to Labor Day, we \[the United States\] were at about 35,000 cases a day.‚Äù  U.S. hospitalizations related to COVID-19 have risen by at least 10% over the past week across 32 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One good thing is the FDA approval of remdesivir, a therapeutic developed by Gildead (GILD) that was used to treat the president.

In Europe, the average number of daily cases rose by 33% compared to last week, accounting for the greatest proportion of new cases in the world, according to data compiled from worldometer.info. France is the hardest hit country in Europe. On Tuesday, it reported more than 33,400 new cases and 523 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, as well as a net increase of 74 admissions to intensive care, bringing the total  to 2,918, over half the country's overall capacity of 5,800. French President Emmanuel Macron announced nationwide restrictions for the next four weeks. Germany joined France, imposing its own four-week nationwide lockwide, which includes curfew and restrictions on businesses like gyms, bars, restaurants, hairdressers etc.

Yesterday, President Trump publicly acknowledged that an agreement on additional stimulus would not happen until after the election. While he signaled that his administration was still willing to negotiate, with the election a mere 6 days away, the chances of stimulus passing before then are practically zero.

Stocks once again traded very choppily, with the market pulling back before reversing intraday to finish mixed. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments around stimulus talks, rising coronavirus infections, and the final presidential debate last night. 

The S&P 500 (SPY) performed the best today, finishing the day 0.29% up. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.2%, and the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell a modest 0.11%.

It appears almost certain that there will not be additional stimulus before the November election, a mere eleven days away. House Speaker Pelosi still thinks it‚Äôs possible for a bill to pass before the election, but says it‚Äôs up to President Trump. She said, ‚ÄúWe put pen to paper‚Ä¶ we are writing the bill, and hopefully we will be able to resolve it‚Ä¶ we could do that before the election if the president wants to.‚Äù Any additional stimulus will likely include a new round of checks and more money for unemployment benefits, schools, state, and local governments. 

This morning, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg TV that ‚Äúthe ball‚Äôs not really moving much right now‚Äù in discussions, and that he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to make any predictions about the timing of an agreement.‚Äù

Unfortunately, in the US, around 71,600 new cases were recorded yesterday, according to data from John Hopkins. According to CBS News that is the fourth-highest number of new infections reported in the country since the pandemic began and the highest number reported since July. During the debate candidate Joe Biden warned of a ‚Äúdark winter coming‚Äù and once again urged the public to wear masks and follow federal social distancing guidelines. President Trump, on the other hand, incorrectly claimed that the virus was ‚Äúgoing away‚Äù and that the US is ‚Äúrounding the corner.‚Äù These statements were meant with severe criticism from health officials and are simply not true from a number‚Äôs perspective, the country is averaging more than 50,000 new infections a day and it appears to be climbing.

In Europe, governments and health officials are scrambling to deal with a surge of infections across the continent, with many fearing a second wave. Millions across Europe are now facing tougher coronavirus restrictions. Italy, France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere are introducing curfews in large regions of the country in a bid to stem the recent spike in cases. In England, the government has imposed restrictions in the capital of London and in cities in the Northern parts of the country.

**Highlights**

* Intel (INTC) sold off more than 10% after the company unexpectedly posted a quarterly decline in data center chip sales, driven by a near-halving of revenue from enterprise and government clients during the pandemic.
* Today, remdesivir, Gilead‚Äôs (GILD) antiviral treatment, became the first drug to receive formal approval by the FDA to treat Covid-19. The drug was used as part of President Trump‚Äôs treatment after his diagnosis earlier this month.

The trial has already been restarted in the U.K.
* Remark Holdings (MARK) jumped 39% in late-afternoon trading on Friday after the company tweeted that for the first time, the company is selling its technologies in partnership with Intel (INTC)

Stocks took a breather today, trading slightly lower after a continuous four-day rally. Market participants closely await the results of the US presidential election. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.07% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.02% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the worst, 0.26% down on the day.

Today, the Labor Department released a better-than-expected October jobs report. The report shows that there were 638,000 non-farm jobs added to the economy versus the 580,000 expectation. The unemployment rate was 6.9%, compared to the 7.6% expectation (unemployment rate in September was 7.9%). The job report is surprisingly good, given the recent surge in coronavirus cases across the United States. 

The US Presidential Election remains the key focal point for market participants and Wall Street. Because of the surge of mail-in ballots, three days after Election Day several key swing states, including Nevada, Georgia and Pennsylvania,  have yet to announce results. According to the Associated Press, Joe Biden has 264 electoral votes to President Trump‚Äôs 214. Candidates need 270 electoral votes to win the election. As of this morning, Joe Biden took a very slim lead in Georgia and Pennsylvania and has increased his lead in Nevada. Below are the states that have been called, according to the Associated Press:

* States called for Trump: Ky., W. Va., S.C., Ala., Miss., Tenn., Okla., Ark., Ind., N.D., S.D., Wyo., La., Neb. (4 of 5 electoral votes), Kan., Mo., Idaho, Utah, Ohio, Iowa, Mont., Fla., Texas
* States called for Biden: Vt., Va., Conn., Del., Ill., Md., Mass., N.J., R.I., N.Y., N.M., D.C., Colo., N.H., Calif., Ore., Wash., Hawaii, Minn., Ariz., Maine (3 of 4 electoral votes), Wis., Mich.

A win for Biden is looking increasingly likely, given he only needs to win one more of the battleground states in order to take the White House. During a press conference yesterday afternoon he said that he had ‚Äúno doubt‚Äù that once the counting was complete he and Kamala Harris ‚Äúwill be declared winners.‚Äù Trump, on his part, has doubled down on his calls ‚Äústop the count‚Äù, baselessly alleging widespread fraud during the election. His campaign has already sued multiple battleground states to challenge to ballot-counting process. A vote in Miching denied Trump‚Äôs efforts. 

Despite some of the uncertainty still surrounding the election, stocks rallied strongly again in the immediate aftermath of Election Day. According to a number of analysts, traders like a divided government, where no single party would control each of the White House, Senate, and House of Representatives. Under that scenario, major policy changes are unlikely to get advanced.

**Highlights**

* The US Office of Special Counsel has opened an investigation into allegations the Trump campaign violated federal law by using the White House on Election Day as a command center, according to Reuters.

I read one of the CNBC analysts thinks part of this can be attributed to the expiration of May futures contracts approaching. (Obviously the low demand being the main issue.)

I know I personally will be looking to see if there is a good buying opportunity on XOM. Im happy with the price per share, the dividend, and I feel good about it being in the Dow Jones ETF.

Anyway, at the time of this post, futures look like they arent even down a half of a percent. I'm considering buying some of the SQQQ and/or some SPXS in premarket in hopes of catching some gains if there is an opening dip/sell off.

Stocks added to Monday‚Äôs gain in the final market session before the US presidential election. Market participants weighed a host of different outcomes for the election against the backdrop of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, economic strain, and heightened social unrest. 

The indices traded choppily but ended the day in the green. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.73% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 2.73% up as well, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, up 2.02%.

Regardless of who wins the presidency, the result is very likely to drive short-term volatility, especially given the political divide and social unrest present in the United States. Any potential outcome from the election is likely to disappoint a large portion of the population, leading to uncertainty and anxiety that could inject volatility into the market. For example, after the 2016 election, the S&P 500 future slumped around 5%. The index went on to recuperate these declines to finish 1% higher by the end of the first post-Election session. Neil Shearing, chief economist for Capital Economics said, ‚ÄúThe experience of 2016 suggests that investors should be careful about taking strong positions on political outcomes and, worse, mechanically translating those to market outcomes.‚Äù

Given the coronavirus pandemic, there has been a surge of early and mail-in voters this year. This could potentially mean that the results of the elections may not become until later on in the week, an outcome sure to negatively affect the markets. According to the US Elections Project,as of this morning, more than 100 million Americans cast their votes early, more than ‚Öî the total numbers of voters during the 2016 election. According to Yahoo Finance, if turnout like this holds up, this election could have the highest voter turnout in 100 years. According to Quinnipiac‚Äôs final pre-election poll, Joe Biden has an edge in the national polls. However, when looking at key swing states, Biden‚Äôs lead is considerably narrower.

The US Senate is also holding elections this year. The combination of which party takes control of the White House and Senate is another issue of major concern. According to Blackrock Analysts, ‚ÄúWe believe a Democratic sweep could pave the way for a new round of large-scale fiscal stimulus and boost spending on clean energy, transport, and housing. It may also bring higher taxes for companies and the wealthy. A Biden win with a Republican-controlled Senate would likely lead to much less fiscal stimulus, little public investment, and no major tax changes,‚Äù the analysts said. Fiscal stimulus under a second Trump term may lie somewhere between these two scenarios, we believe, while public investment could be similarly small as under a Biden divided government.‚Äù

**Highlights**

* McKesson Corp (MCK) on Tuesday said it and two other major U.S. drug distributors could be expected to pay up to $21 billion under a new proposal to resolve thousands of lawsuits alleging they helped fuel the U.S. opioid crisis.
* Twitter (TWTR) said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that the company's board of directors had reviewed CEO Jack Dorsey's leadership and will allow him to remain as CEO.

* The Shanghai Stock Exchange suspended Ant's blockbuster IPO late Tuesday, a day after four regulatory agencies summoned Mr. Ma and the company's top two executives to a closed-door meeting. The company said a concurrent Hong Kong listing would also be suspended. Ant plans to return the funds it has collected from investors who subscribed to its IPO, which had been on track to raise at least $34.4 billion in total.

Stocks fell today, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 adding to yesterday‚Äôs losses with market participants closely monitoring the political situation in the US and a worsening virus situation despite positive vaccine data.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.46% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.93%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the worst, finishing 1.03% down.

Since Joe Biden‚Äôs victory on Saturday, President Trump has struck an increasingly defiant tone, refusing to concede the election and baselessly claiming widespread, national voter fraud in favor of the Democrats. Since then Trump filed a flurry of lawsuits against key states, alleging voter fraud. Most of these suits have been thrown out of Court for insufficient evidence. Moreover, Trump is purposefully blocking Biden from accessing key information needed for a smooth transition of power. 

Today, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was pulling back from negotiating a new stimulus package. There will likely be no further stimulus until a change in administration is made on January 20th. 

Sadly, this week alone, daily new coronavirus cases in the United States went from a little over 100,000 (a record at the time) to more than 145,000 cases as of Wednesday, a new record of daily cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has set a new number of daily infections every day this week, a very worrying sign. Hospitalizations are also on the rise, with the country recording record amounts of patients hospitalized with COVID the past two days, climbing from 61,964 on Tuesday to 65,368 on Wednesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. That‚Äôs double the number of hospitalizations compared to a month ago. North Dakota and Wisconsin have warned their hospitals are reaching capacity, with both State‚Äôs governors declaring a state of emergency. Texas became the first state to surpass 1 million cases of coronavirus. The rise in infections comes with new highs in the number of deaths reported in a single day at 1,549, the highest since May 14. Tennessee, Alabama and Minnesota all reached new highs in the number of deaths reported in a single day, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.

Earlier in the week, hopes of market participants and the public overall were greatly raised by Pfizer‚Äôs (PFE) announcement that their clinical trial showed their vaccine candidate had a 90% effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 in participants with no evidence of a previous infection. However, optimism moderated after it became clear that even with approval, widespread distribution of the vaccine wouldn‚Äôt take place until 2021.

741,A Detailed Breakdown of Warren Buffet's Portfolio for 2020,1576144110.0,"I made this video looking at the top holdings in Warren Buffett's portfolio, analyzing why he invested in them and if they have been a good investment so far. I don't want to force anyone to watch it so I will give a summary for each stock. If you do choose to watch the video and want to give feedback, it would be appreciated!  


[https://youtu.be/JM5zwSBi790](https://youtu.be/JM5zwSBi790)  


 **Apple - 25.96% ($55,732,400,000)** 

>He claims that his main reasons for investing are because of their amazing products, brand, and most important brand loyalty. Warren recognizes the strength of this brand and people‚Äôs willingness to pay more for Apple products. In addition to loving the company, warren has also gotten a very good price for the company. With regard to other tech companies, Apple is considered much safer and has shown consistent returns. 

**Bank of America - 12.60% ($27,047,843,000)** 

> In the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 the banks weren‚Äôt in great shape. Ever since, Warren has been purchasing shares of BAC and other companies in the financial sector. His main reasons for doing so have been their relatively low price tags, low P/E ratios, and fair dividends. In 2019 alone, Buffett added almost 1 billion shares to his position in Q2 of 2019, showing that he still thinks the stock is trading below what he believes the company is worth. 

 **Coca-Cola - 10.14% ($21,776,000,000)** 

>Coca-Cola is a company that needs no explanation. It is arguably one of Warren Buffett's greatest investments, being so fond of the stock he has even said that he never has and never will sell a share of Coca-Cola. His reasons for investing in Coca-Cola are very similar to his reasoning for investing in Apple, knowing that customers are willing to pay more because of just how strong the brand loyalty is. He started investing in Coca-Cola soon after the stock market crash of 1987, buying it for about the same price as it pays out in dividends each year now. Berkshire is currently Coca-Cola‚Äôs largest shareholder with 9.4% of its outstanding shares, worth close to $22 billion and making up 10.14% of Warren‚Äôs Portfolio 

 **Wells Fargo - 8.89% ($ 19,084,935,000)** 

> Wells Fargo is a banking, investing, credit, and financial services company. His reasoning for owning this stock is very similar to why he owns Bank of America stock. Despite the bank being involved in a series of scandals since 2016, Buffett doesn‚Äôt seem to mind. His main focus is that Wells Fargo was involved in all these problems, but despite this, they aren‚Äôt losing any customers to speak of. This customer loyalty is one of the reasons why Buffett currently has $19 billion dollars invested in Wells Fargo, making up 8.89% of his portfolio. 

 **American Express - 8.35% ($17,932,512,000)** 

> American Express is a credit card and charge company and has always been a target for Warren whenever the markets take a dip and everyone else is fearful. That‚Äôs why he gets such great entry prices on his investments. Since picking up his initial stake in 1963, he has since grown his position to close to $18 billion, making up 8.35% of his portfolio. When you consider that American Express has seen a 12.5% average annual return over the past quarter-century, it‚Äôs no wonder he is such a big fan of this company. 

 **Kraft Heinz - 4.24% ($9,096,609,000)** 

> If there is any investment that Warren Buffett regrets, it‚Äôs Kraft Heinz, his sixth largest investment. In 2018, Berkshire Hathaway recorded a $3 billion non-cash loss, that Buffett said arised ‚Äúalmost entirely from their equity interest in Kraft Heinz‚Äù. Kraft's shares have lost 14.7% on an annualized total return basis since Sept. 30, 2015. That includes a 23% plunge in 2019. 

 **US Bank Corp, JP Morgan Chase, Moody's, Goldman Sachs, and the Bank of New York Mellon** All you really need to know is that he has been buying shares every time the prices crash and since 2008 he has been increasing his position in almost every financial stock. 

 **Delta Air Lines - 1.90% ($4,084,442,000)** 

> Buffett first picked up shares of Delta Air Lines in the third quarter of 2016. Recently raising his stake in Delta by 8% in Q1 of 2019, making Berkshire Hathaway the largest Delta shareholder, owning 10.9% of outstanding shares. 

**Southwest Airlines - 1.35% ($2,897,595,000)** 

>Like Delta, this is another airline that Buffett picked up in late 2016.The discount carrier is beloved by its customers and employees alike, typically finding itself near the top of ""Best Airline"" and ""Best Places to Work For"" lists. So it has a safe reputation and as an investment, it has performed decently within the Berkshire fold, generating an annualized total return of 16.1% since Aug. 31, 2016.",2019-12-12 02:48:30

744,Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days),1607667031.0,"
This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

745,$NFLX is trading above $550 now,1594433789.0,"They were at $350 before their pandemic dip, so they have gone up nearly 60% from where they were before the pandemic.

I understand demand has likely gone up, and more people are streaming now with nothing else to do, but did they gain 60% more subscribers in that time frame? Unless I'm missing something, they don't make money the more someone watches if they were already a subscriber, they don't have ads. 

I understand markets are forward thinking or whatever, but there are so many streaming services now which own the rights to popular shows that Netflix currently has but likely lose once the contracts run out.

748,"""Robinhood warns day traders to raise their cash buffers on 'widely-held stocks' hours before market open """,1602872435.0,"  

* **Trading platform Robinhood warned day traders on Thursday night to raise their cash buffers on ""several widely-held stocks"" hours before market open, or they could face an account deficit.**
* **The trading platform said it would increase the minimum amount required to be held in user accounts from October 16 onwards to ""help protect"" customers from increased election volatility.**
* **""If you hold any of the affected stocks on margin, your buying power may decrease or your account may be in a deficit after these changes go into effect,"" Robinhood said.**
* **""If you do not resolve the margin call, we may need to sell off some or all of your stock to cover the call,"" it said.**

&#x200B;

Retail trading platform Robinhood warned users late on Thursday to raise their cash reserves on ""several widely-held stocks,"" hours before market open.

The company, which has spearheaded commission-free stock and ETF trading, said it would increase the margin maintenance requirements for those stocks affected by election volatility. It maintains the move would help protect customers from increased election volatility.

Packy McCormick, a day trader, **posted the warning in a tweet** at 9:42 p.m. ET on Thursday, minutes after receiving it. Regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange starts at 9:30 a.m. ET.

Other users blasted the move, with [**one**](https://twitter.com/Nobel_Zobel/status/1316930116837146624) even saying ""I'm not sure how this could be legal.""

Investing on margins means that traders can borrow money as loans from Robinhood to buy stocks and options, making it possible to boost investment gains. Margin maintenance, meanwhile, is the minimum amount required to be held in the account to avoid stumbling blocks with Robinhood.

""If you hold any of the affected stocks on margin, your buying power may decrease or your account may be in a deficit after these changes go into effect,"" the warning read.

Users will be issued a ""**margin call**"" if they fall short of the required minimum and don't deposit additional funds to increase their account value by the end of the trading day on October 16.

""If you do not resolve the margin call, we may need to sell off some or all of your stock to cover the call,"" it said.

It is common practice on futures exchanges for margin requirements to increase as market volatility rises, because of the greater potential for traders to rack up losses that they cannot then afford to cover.

Stock market volatility rose earlier this year to its highest since the extremes witnessed during the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, as investors around the world dumped equities to hold cash, government bonds, and even gold.

The warning was issued on the same day that Bloomberg reported **hackers gained access to ""almost 2,000""** trading accounts on Robinhood's platform.

This week, the company sent a push notification through its app prompting customers to start using ¬†two-factor authentication. Security ""is a top priority and something we take very seriously,"" a spokesperson told Business Insider.

The trading platform has seen its popularity explode recently, with COVID-19 only fuelling its prominence, given the boom in retail trading thanks in part to the volatility across markets from uncertainty over coronavirus. Lockdowns earlier this year that halted most professional sporting activity, for example, encouraged many amateur investors to try day-trading.

This is a new post after some interest in a comment ***why I believed the S&P is going to 1700***.

**Update 3:**  I am going to limit my answers in the comments guys; as the post becomes more popular it is becoming more diluted with snark etc.  *I don't expect anyone to follow my opinions; I just want to share one aspect of why I am making the trades I am.  I maybe wrong.  Random walk and all that..*

**Original Disclaimer**:  *This is based on historical precedence and we are in unprecedented times but, with history as our guide a strong argument can be made for the S&P to decline to a level that is currently inconceivable.*  **I have disclosed all my positions near the bottom.**

# Intro:   Are we in a recession?

If you believe so, or that we are heading into a recession then there are four things needed to support a genuine rally out of a recession

&#x200B;

* Fiscal policy
* Monetary policy
* Improving economic health indicators
* Accurate pricing reflecting the end of the recession and tempered optimism

We are missing 2 out of those 4 criteria; the overwhelming monetary and fiscal policy (world-records) are compensating for lack of positive *indicators* and *volatile and bullish* *pricing*.

# What do you mean by pricing?

It can be argued that the current price of stocks is not discounting for the acute and likely chronic harm to consumer sentiment and spending power.  For example; the UK clothing retailer Next Group closed their bricks and mortar stores (share price increased 4%) then they cancelled all online shopping (share price increased 3%) and finally they cancelled all orders with their supply chain (shares leapt 12.8% during the rally.)  There is the massive amount of second, third and fourth order effects that this one company does to the UK economy (and Turkish factories).  Suppliers, shipping, design, marketing etc all cancelled and the staff furloughed.

This is one example but the indexes are currently full of similar examples and some analysts are ringing the alarm bells.

>Lazard Asset Management are concerned that the pandemic ‚Äúwill persist longer than many investors suspect and that the economic damage will be deeper and potentially longer-lasting‚Äù.

Reddit is quick to mention that *stonks* only go up but there is some truth to that sentiment at present since *any negative factors* are dismissed as being priced in and all positive factors are heralded as a cause for stocks to rally.  If priced in was accurate then we would not see record-beating market rallies back to back.  10% volatility swings over 48 hours is the very definition of *not priced in.*

There is evidence to suggest that, well, the bullish sentiment is wrong and mainly because it is [retail investors being taken for a ride](https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-stock-market-investors-buy-the-dip-80ae288d-619b-487a-acbd-8409c05db52d.html) whilst funds re-balance and offload.

Retail traders ""buying the dips"" is normally a contrarian signal, meaning that it's time to sell.  This section is for u/lntoIerant in response to a comment.

# Edit to answer some comments about this portion thus far.

**Do retail investors move the market?**

* No, they act as a sentiment indicator that the market is reaching a peak absurdity.  Similar sentiments have preceded major recessions in the past.  When you hear a layman offering stock tips or googling *how to buy stocks* then we are reaching the precipice of a depression.  new market entrants are not the same as traditional retail investors.

**Are retail investors buying in greater volumes?**

* That is hard to say because the majority of retail trades are done off-book.  The trades are mixed in with portfolio moves or [using the retail service](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/volumes-grow-on-nyse-retail-service-20130821) which is a dark pool.

**Are retail investors dumb money?**

* Well, no.  Kind of.  It depends.  This [white paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2822105) indicates that retail investors are more knowledgeable, more profitable and better informed than previously thought.  However, a lot of their trades, as mentioned above, are done off-book as part of a larger portfolio and they simply lose a fraction of a basis point because market timing is not that critical.

&#x200B;

# What does this have to do with the S&P dividend and the EPS?

&#x200B;

Major indexes are comprised of stocks that [pay handsome dividends](https://www.dividendinvestor.com/the-sp-500-dividend-yield-a-historical-analysis/); normally 2% yield a year. The companies have reached their limit of growth (HSBC haven't discovered 5 million new customers and Shell are not finding new fossil fuels) so investors hold the stock for **income-seeking reasons**.

The FTSE 100 was priced in to generate ¬£89 billion in dividends for 2019 and ¬£90 billion+ in 2020.  That has largely collapsed.

The only companies that pay dividends are those taking on debt to do so like Shell.  And they have; [a 10Bn credit line to maintain dividends](https://www.ft.com/content/ee832198-024b-4a0f-a61d-de767a1e6d6c).  The Bank of England[had to slap 5 UK banks](https://www.ft.com/content/c13d3d21-b6f3-4449-a916-2ba4271818e4) from issuing dividends at this time.  That means that their primary valuations as income-generating stocks are questionable...

...especially since the dividends are not expected to return to the 2020 levels for another 10 years now.  Edit to add:  This portion is taken from the market report by BNY Mellon.  [You can see the chart here](https://www.bnymellon.com/_global-assets/pdf/our-thinking/the-aerial-view/chart-of-the-day-march-31-2020.pdf).  The analyst is John Velis of BNY.  Thanks to u/flash_aaaah_ahhhhh for prompting me.

&#x200B;

>‚ÄúBy 2021, the market expects dividends per share for the S&P 500 to be down to under $38 per share (a staggering 41 per cent drop from recent highs of approximately $63 per share) and then to start slowly rising again. Going out 10 years to 2030, the expectation is that dividends will just about recover to pre-Covid-19 levels.‚Äù

&#x200B;

# 

# Main body:  Onto the S&P

In 2021 the market expects the dividends per share for the S&P to be reduced to $38 per share.  That is priced in and common knowledge.

That is a 41% drop from the recent highs of $63 a share and seems alarming for income seeking investors since we are not expected to recover to those prices for 8-10 years.  [Source.](https://www.bnymellon.com/_global-assets/pdf/our-thinking/the-aerial-view/chart-of-the-day-march-31-2020.pdf)

But DataTrek have noted that **we are still currently trading at 21X** the trailing 10 year earnings of $122 a share.

Dividends per share normally don't fall as far as earnings per share.  But they are inverted at present.

For the S&P to be trading at 2,650 level (or even higher) it means the market does not believe the pandemic or recession will have any long-term damage.  That puts us squarely at odds with items 3 and 4 in our list of factors needed to exit a bear market.

# Talk to me about 2008!

Thanks to u/mister_woody for asking for more data.

&#x200B;

* **S&P 500 high:** 1565.15, Oct. 9, 2007
* **Low:** 682.55, March 5, 2009
* **S&P 500 loss:** 56.4 percent
* **Duration:** 17 monthts
* **EPS decline**:  86 to 7
* **Dividend decline**:   26-28 down to 22-24

In other recessions, including 2008, the dividend price per share drops approximately 12-15% but the earnings per share drop by considerably more; as much as 85%.

That means that in 2008 financial crisis and subsequent bear market; the dividends per share dropped by a lower percentage amount than the ***total index value drop***.

You can see that in [this chart here](https://www.gurufocus.com/economic_indicators/63/sp-500-index#63+59+58).

&#x200B;

* The market drop was approximately 56% and the Dividend drop was 14%
* The market drop was 56% and the earnings drop was 85%

Right now, we have the reverse.  Dividend share drop **in this market** is 41% (which is chilling) and market drop was approximately only 30% and rallying heavily back to the mid-20's only.  That makes no financial sense unless the assets were being propped up by buyers...

&#x200B;

* **S&P ATH**:   3386 to 2488 on April 4th (26.5% drop)
* **S&P ATH Dividend**:  From $63 expected to $38 (a 41% drop)
* **S&P ATH EPS**:

If the S&P follows the same playbook at 2008-9, then we would expect to see levels of around 1400 at the bottom but that seems **extremely** bearish expecting that this crisis is worse than 2008.

If previous indications hold true, then we would expect the S&P to drop by approximately 50-60%ish at the true bottom to reflect the 41% decrease in expected shares plus additional discounts and negative market sentiment.

In reality, we are probably likely to pull back to between 13X and 15X trailing average which puts the S&P between 1600 (low side) and 1800 (high side).

&#x200B;

# You are putting a lot of faith in a re-run of the 2008 crisis

I am.  No doubt about it.  After October 2008, stocks fell for [another four months](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-24/it-took-four-months-and-40-in-s-p-before-2008-stimulus-worked?srnd=premium), piling up 40% of losses before the recently ended bull market began in March 2009.

# New market indicators

Since I wrote this post, the DJIA was up over 4% and closed down on the day.

Thank you to the[Twitter feed of Jim Bianco](https://twitter.com/biancoresearch/status/1247681027469950977) for this:  Since 1925 (95 yrs!), up more than 4% and closing down on the day has happened only one other time ... Oct 14, 2008 (Tsy Sec Hank Paulson forced the banks to take TARP money).   The S&P 500 was up 3.5% at the high and closed down on the day.   Since April 1982 (daily H,L,C began) has happened three other times...Oct 3, 08, Oct 14, 08, and Oct 17, 08.

This mkt continues to trade like Oct 08. It was six months and another 25% down before the low.

# Why is bullish sentiment so wrong?

The negative reports are so wildly negative that the almost defy belief.  We are dealing with insane numbers way beyond our traditional frame of reasoning. This is topped only by the insanity of the scale of quantitative easing.  Less than a year ago, a small movement in the non-farm payrolls would lead to a 2-3% move in the markets; now we are hitting 700K jobs lost, a truly ugly number and the market rallies hugely. Future economic students will study this to try and understand what was happening.

In the space of *weeks* the majority of the Western economies have swung to being effectively state-sponsored, centralised economies and no one really knows how to unwind these positions.

It is impossible to reconcile being a bull with a centralised state economy and blue-chip stocks that refuse to pay dividends but the share price remains at the same levels as when they paid a 2% yield.

The [UK forecast](https://www.ft.com/content/33c03dc6-ceab-40e5-b61f-66829c5b9b2c) is for the deepest contraction since 1900.  Business surveys have shown activity [crashing](https://www.ft.com/content/e8c47f34-32b7-44b3-8e8a-102f9d6c2ae6) faster in March than during the financial crisis.  The Office for National Statistics has published experimental research on the [impact](https://www.ft.com/content/37215bb4-39a5-4265-97fb-95d8a105e5a1) of Covid-19 on the economy.

&#x200B;

>**With entire swaths of the economy having shut down ‚Äútraditional forecasting methods become irrelevant‚Äù, warned Chiara Zangarelli, economist at investment bank Nomura.**

Michelle Girard, economist at NatWest, said that while there was huge uncertainty about the precise magnitude of the contraction in gross domestic product in the second quarter, ‚Äúthere is little doubt that it will be off the scale‚Äù

**That is not a bullish sentiment.  It means markets are acting irrationally since fundamentals are being dismissed as priced-in.   In reality; nothing is priced in.**

# Edit to add:  So, your entire thesis is totally destroyed if companies keep paying dividends?

Yes.

In a nutshell.

But something else will be destroyed; the western taxpayer and future growth.

&#x200B;

* If companies are using 0% interest rates to take out loans and then transferring those loans a small 1% of the populace via dividends; that bill will come due to the citizen taxpayer and/or shareholder of the future
* If companies are taking federal or governmental aid to furlough workers but still paying dividends to shareholders?  That bill will come due to the citizen taxpayer and effectively is an even more extreme form of socialising market losses; it means that we truly can never have a correction since the top 1% will lose.  Not lose the investment itself, which can rebound, but will simply lose the yield on an investment and only for a short period of time.  If we have reached a point where that is considered unacceptable then we truly are living in a new socialist, centrally planned world.
* Here is [Tesco defending their decision](https://www.ft.com/content/4719c92c-ab17-4852-92e6-533c682611f4) today of ¬£635m in dividends...despite receiving considerable amounts of VAT, Rates and Rental relief from the UK Government (¬£585m)...they have done an admirable job and are profitable but this market signal and their stated *reasons* for doing so are alarming.

>CEO said 'every pound we receive \[in rates relief\] will be invested in ensuring Tesco is able to support British shoppers...' That is tax payers paying a subsidy to a free-market company for the ability to shop...**and also...**  
>  
>Mr Lewis said that the **needs of savers and pension funds also needed to be considered in the debate around dividends**.¬†‚ÄúWe‚Äôve thought long and hard about our responsibilities here‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâwe are in a strong position to pay out for the benefit of those people

# Edit to add:  What about the FED and stimulus

&#x200B;

u/tauriel81 and u/aliveintucson325 and u/100PERCENTYOLO_VEQT

OK - to truly test my own assumptions; here is my argument AGAINST my position.

The Fed have not quite *printed money* as Reddit loves to meme. They have issued *liquidity* and central banks worldwide have allowed banks to relax their requirement to hold reserves of cash. That injects money into the business world by allowing lending and borrowing to continue. It also reduces *theoretical* risk since the models are back within tolerance.

When the time comes they will *remove the credits* gradually without causing hyperinflation. They do this by paying banks not to lend back into the system by holding a % of their assets at the Federal Reserve. So they pay the banks but the banks keep the deposit at the Fed and don't pass on the liquidity to potential borrowers..gradually and sustainably.

[https://www.aier.org/article/powells-new-monetary-regime/](https://www.aier.org/article/powells-new-monetary-regime/)

That means the borrower of the future (home purchasers, entreprenuers etc) will have very few credit facilities available so RIP to the long-term economic growth.

We also have **unprecedented** government support for citizens. The largest social security welfare plan since WW2, especially in Europe.

If you believe that the Western economies can weather this storm using the bridging devices by central banks then it pays to *dollar cost average* into the market and keep buying the dips as a retail investor.

Lots of buoyant news from European nations and China about the slowing pandemic is overwhelming the negative leading and lagging economic indicators about economic data.

**If you believe the economy can return to normal within 36 months, then it pay to be bullish and invest.**

If you are day-trading, swing-trading or short-term options trading then the overwhelming market moves are likely to crush people as the system flexes under lots of volatility. You are also likely prioritising the negative news and technical analysis in your filter bubble and de-prioritising the positive news particularly when that news is fiscal or monetary policy since those things are dry, boring and incomprehensible half the time.

So you miss *Fed backstops critical bankingi* and instead hear *UK Prime Minister in intensive care.*

If you want to know what is going on...

&#x200B;

* Look at the short term fundamentals
* Zoom out. Re-look.
* Zoom out to an even longer timeline. Re-look.
* Zoom out to an even even longer timeline. Re-look.
* Zoom out to an even even even longer timeline. Re-look.

Decide where you making a prediction. Plan your trade, trade your plan.

**How do the FED take money back out of the economy?**

They FED purchase the security initially to then sell it back to the asset-holder later. So the balance of credit-deficit merely swaps but by paying a small premium on the excesses that they hold, they can cushion the inflation or deflation of the currency.

So, they effectively give the bank liquidity and then remove that liquidity later by passing the asset back...but also provide a small premium to cushion the blow; 50% of the premium is then held on Federal Reserve books so that the market is not flooded with new money.

The FED previously reduced their balance sheet [from $4.4 trillion to $3.7 trillion](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL) but it remains to be seen if they can unwind a position of this size.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR

&#x200B;

* 2 out of the 4 necessities for exiting a recession are not present
* S&P currently trading at 21X the trailing 10 year average dividend
* In previous recessions a 50% drop in the market was accompanied by a 15% drop in dividends
* Market analysts expecting for a 41% drop in dividends but only trading a 26% drop in the market.  At present the S&P dividend per share drop is 41% but the S&P is rallying back to less than 20% drop...whilst dividends are not expected to return to 2019 levels of income for 8-10 years
* In previous recessions the dividend per share drop is much *less* than the overall index drop
* S&P highly overvalued, completely inverted when compared with dividend expectation and market dividend pricing
* S&P pull back to 1600-1800 over short-medium time frame (1 month-6 months).
* If market history is to be believed then 1400 is not unfeasible based on percentages but you have to be hoping for a total economic destruction for this to happen.; expect a total Governmental response if this happens.
* If S&P continues to rise then it indicates companies are taking on debt or other instruments to pay dividends rather than innovate, upgrade or consolidate their business position which some are (Shell etc).
* Economic data will eventually overpower the stimulus and the Coronavirus is not priced in; hardly anything is priced in and analysts are now saying so publicly.

Stocks accelerated yesterday‚Äôs losses as market participants digested a new round of corporate earnings report and the prospects of additional stimulus before the November presidential election.

The Nasdaq finished 0.84% down. The S&P (SPY) fell 0.63%, and the Dow Jones finished the day 0.53% down.

Today, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin admitted that coming to a deal regarding stimulus and advancing the measure through Congress would be ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù before the November election. The remarks come shortly after Mnuchin and House Speaker Pelosi met on the phone to negotiate further, a deal Pelosi‚Äôs spokesperson called ‚Äúproductive‚Äù. The two are set to discuss again tomorrow, but after multiple weeks of discussion and the November election coming ever-nearer, chances for additional stimulus look dim. 

The impasse between US lawmakers over stimulus is alarming, given the frequent calls of Pres. Trump, Jerome Powell and other FOMC members, and economist for more virus-relief. Yesterday, Senate Leader Mitch McConnel said he would introduce a smaller, more targeted proposal to the Senate when the chamber reconvenes next Monday. He said ‚ÄúWhen the full Senate returns on October 19th, our first order of business will be voting again on targeted relief for American workers, including new funding for the PPP.‚Äù The estimated $500 billion deal is way below the $1.8 trillion package proposed by the White House earlier in the week, a sign that negotiations may be souring. However, Pelosi has made it clear she would not support smaller, targeted bills, calling them inadequate. Pres. Trump appears to agree with her, tweeting ‚ÄúGo big or go home!!!‚Äù for more stimulus. 

In other news, two companies in the forefront of vaccine development for the coronavirus announced their respective trials were put on trial over safety concerns. Eli Lilly (LLY) said Tuesday afternoon that enrollment for its COVID-19 treatment would be temporarily halted, less than a day after Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) said clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate were paused due to an unexplained illness in a participant. Shares of Eli Lilly and Johnson & Johnson were little changed overnight after dropping during Tuesday‚Äôs session.

In terms of earnings season, all eyes are on big banks as they have already started to report. An article published by Marketbeat summarized sentiment by stating that ‚ÄúJPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America saw their profits partly recover in the third quarter from the depths of the coronavirus-caused recession earlier this year. The turnaround stems mostly from improvements in the U.S. economy that allowed these big banks to set aside less money to cover potentially bad loans ‚Äî $5 billion in the third quarter versus $33 billion in the second quarter.‚Äù

Unfortunately, yesterday the United States passed the grim milestone of 250,000 deaths from coronavirus. The death toll surpasses the White House‚Äôs worst-case prediction from the Spring ([https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/31/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-could-kill-many-240-000-americans/5100446002/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/31/trump-coronavirus-pandemic-could-kill-many-240-000-americans/5100446002/)) and is predicted to keep rising with the surge of infections and hospitalizations in the last two weeks. According to Johns Hopkins University, the US is averaging a record 161,165 new infections a day in the last seven days. That‚Äôs up 27% compared to last week and by far the most since the pandemic began. Data is trending in the wrong directions, with 44 out of 50 states reporting a 10% increase in new cases compared to last week.

In response to the surge in cases, governors from both sides of the aisle have announced a variety of new restrictions. California‚Äôs governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state is ‚Äúpulling the emergency brake‚Äù on reopening and reinstated broad restrictions throughout the state. In Iowa, Republican Governor Kim Reynolds, who once dismissed coronavirus restrictions as ""feel-good"" measures, has abruptly reversed course, issuing the state's first mask mandate and limiting indoor gatherings. Illinois\*\*,\*\* Michigan, and New Jersey announced additional restrictions that limit gatherings to household members. Indoor event spaces are also being ordered to shut-down or move outdoors. In Massachusetts, the governor announced a stay-at-home advisory. Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota are under state-wide mask mandate. These are just some examples, there are many more.

The Labor Department released its weekly jobs report. Another 742,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week, an unexpected rise compared to the 711,000 reported last week as coronavirus cases continue to surge.

* 742,000 new claims vs 700,000 estimate
* Continuing claims,  which is the number of people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, was 6.4 million, equal to the estimate.

Despite the positive vaccine data from Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA), setting up an efficient, global vaccine distribution network will likely take months, even after the vaccines are approved. In the short-term, we expect the worsening pandemic and uncertainty surrounding additional fiscal stimulus will likely drive volatility in the short-term.

765,"Information on PLTR for those interested in the company and its history (plus insider ""selling"" explained). No hype just research.",1622200565.0,"This started as a comment reply but I thought maybe people would like reading it. I've been researching Palantir since literally late November 2020 and I have nearly my entire portfolio in LEAPS expiring January 2023. So I have continually done more research on them this is just the basics to clear up confusion and help people who don't understand it because it's hard to hear all the hype and stuff. Also AMC to the moon tomorrow for my FDs I bought!! Don't judge me it's just fun to be in on the action on weeks like this.


So you should think of palantir as basically three companies and they actually are very far from unprofitable. 

They developed the really massive government software (gotham) specifically as a result of an interaction that happened to Peter Thiel while he was at paypal. They were losing millions to foreign scammers at paypal and the solution ended up being a high quality algorithm that flagged the most likely scam transactions and then allowed analysts to efficiently double check and verify the real scam transactions.

 It essentially was using what computers are efficient at (sorting through massive amounts of data) and then combining that with what humans are good at (looking at the more complex nuances that at least at that point computer algorithms were incapable of doing) and augmenting the humans ability to make complex decisions by rapidly sorting through the incoming data and bringing everything good to their attention.

They fixed paypals using this method and literally made the company profitable overnight because of fixing how much they were losing in the scam transactions. The FBI contacted PayPal and Thiel about using that initial software. That was literally his inspiration for what would become Palantir. He goes over it in huge detail in his book zero to one. If you make an audible account you can read it for free and find the chapter I'm talking about.

Then for 15 years they perfected the government software into the absolute nearly monopoly it is now in government intelligence augmentation software. The whole time though they reinvested almost everything for the last 10 years into building the commercial software (Foundry). That side of the business has only been live for a VERY short time and initially they literally didn't spend a single dollar on marketing their first commercial clients sought THEM out because of their insane reputation with the government. Foundry helps with supply chains and all kinds of other important data  insights. But if you want a recent example the NIH and the NHS both used Foundry to figure out how to best distribute the vaccine and vaccine distribution in the US and Britain has far outpaced expectations. You think commercial companies aren't going to be interested in using the software that was literally proven on a level like that?

 They're only just now adding huge amounts of people to their sales teams literally in the last six months which if you read Peter thiels book is insane for the stock because they have this crazy long term plan and he literally talks about how when they get to a certain point and start adding sales as a full sector of the company it means that is the company the company plans to BEGIN scaling. Meaning they're this big and they literally only just started on the scaling part. Which they've also said in tons of interviews if you're a die hard Palantirian like me. 



They actually also have the third side of the  business which is their actual like full AI for weaponization and war and defense for the government. Gotham is like helping analysts and commanders lead and even helping police or agents figure out what's going on. This other software is different. It's called Apollo and its only at the beginning too. It's like pure AI machine learning AI handles everything stuff. Go find a video called pentagon head of NSC briefs public on AI I think it's on the PBS channel on YouTube or some shit. Or you can listen to Joe Biden talk about how we're going to double our percentage of gdp spending on AI. The amount of government money that's going to go into AI as a weapon to compete with China DWARFS peoples expectations of how much large the market for the kind of software palantir makes is. 

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201001005334/en/U.S.-Army-Research-Lab-Selects-Palantir-Technologies-Inc.-for-91M-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Development

This is literally the backbone of everything AI that the government is about to invest in. Sure they're going to experiment with other research but if you do research you'll also find Palantir is the ONLY company that does anything remotely like this software that has anywhere near the kind of clearances like what is required for these contracts. They are currently a clearance level 5 and about to be the highest 6. The closest competitors are almost all a 3 or lower I'm not even sure if there's more than a single 4 and that stuff is crazy hard to get. 

But like again I'm an obsessive. I realize why people get so excited about the commercial side scaling and how it's very possible and can make them huge and it will. But I'm actually pretty sure the reason people like Cathy Wood has such a huge boner for them is that she realizes how MASSIVELY. And I mean MASSIVELY underestimated the amount of government revenue they will get from all this AI investing the United States and NATO are about to do. It's literally the next Manhattan project and they're absolutely going to be one of the biggest players developing it if not the biggest. I think it's funny because most people are pretty disinterested in the government stuff for Palantir but i really think the weaponized AI apollo stuff may be as big as anything could ever be. 




Also people got the insider selling stuff very very wrong. Tom Nash (love him or hate him I don't care) has a few really good recent videos where he explains it in basically full detail what was happening. The selling panicked a lot of retail investors during a time when the buying for growth markets had really slowed because of rate hike due to inflation scares and a ton of retail holders got scared and caused more selling and more people got scared because of that and sold and it really just was mass psychology in effect and a LOT of FUD and confusion. 

Basically a few executives karp in particular got billions of dollars worth of options that vest but literally expire so you have to exercise them which means you buy shares of the company at a strike price. Well because it's the company granting shares the strike price is literally 10 cents or something and these automatically have to vest at quarterly increments. So everytime karp was exercising he's actually buying shares. Like over 150 million in total maybe a lot more million SHARES not dollars. shares. And even those when he exercising he's buying shares technically from the company it ALL counts as profit on taxes and ITS NOT LONG TERM CAP GAINS ELIGIBLE. So over the last year plus this year he's essentially getting shares but the literal dollar value of those shares to the government counts as pure profit. So his total income which he's getting taxed at 40% of is in the BILLIONS yes billions. Because that's a lot to handle people that work for them actually automatically schedule sells of shares to cover the taxes so that there's no issue it's not even like him saying sell today and they do this.... TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE ACCUSATION OF INSIDER SELLING TO THE SEC. That's why it's automatically happening so no one can ever claim he's timing it. 

So listen cause here's where it gets important. The exercising of the shares counts as almost pure profits but remember he's receiving SHARES not dollars he doesn't actually get billions of dollars. So has to then sell SOME of the shares so he can pays taxes on that. Then when he sells the shares to pay the taxes for exercising he actually owes even more money if they went up from when he exercised. So everytime he's selling low its actually good for him because it's less ADDITIONAL PROFIT that he would owe taxes on.

 If he wasn't selling its because he thought it would go down even further and then he would actually owe less taxes overall. So if he thought it was going to tank he'd wait and actually get a nice fat discount on his taxes. 

I know this seems really crazy but I promise that's how it works you can look it up in detail but yeah shocking that mainstream media and redditors/youtubers who barely do research and have no real understanding of how these billion dollar compensations work would get it wrong. Unbelievable I know. If he had actually sold the massive overall percentage of his shares that some people claim he did the company would be at like $3-6 dollars not low 20s. Retail got confused because of market pressured due to interest rate fears from inflation and sold low (like retail always does) to institutions.",2021-05-28 04:16:05

Look, we all know what's going on with GameStop. We know there are others out there. There are lots of stocks that have been heavily shorted for years and yes, a lot of them will squeeze, especially now with WSB getting so much attention. 

Along with those opportunities has come an influx of hundreds of thousands of subscribers to this sub, over 100k within just the last few days. With those new subscribers comes a slew of charlatans trying to sell shitty investment services/courses, promote their YouTube channels, get you to follow their Twitter, etc. **First, this is a warning that we will ban first and ask questions later for self-promotional posts, anything that is obviously designed to pump low volume stocks or manipulate the market, or in general is just a low effort, shitty post.**

**Second, and more importantly, I see this time period - with a lot of new growth incoming - as a great opportunity to vastly improve the content of this sub.** These shenanigans that have been going on with GameStop are proving to us that there are real opportunities out there, but we need quality content and quality contributions to find them. That means not filling the front page of this sub with bullshit posts that are two sentences long pumping your penny stock that trades 50,000 shares a day. It also means not posting ideas that are solely based around fucking manipulative hedge funds, short sellers, and the like. That's not because we agree with what they do or because we want to promote their ability to continue to screw over retail traders, but because doing this will bring unwanted attention to this community and potentially get us banned from Reddit.

So, sure you can post about stocks that have high short interest and that might present opportunities for short squeezes, but don't make your post ""lol let's manipulate stonk ABCD cuz it has 14743% short interest YOLO!!1!"" Instead, put some actual effort into your posts and let's find some real opportunities.

We'll be removing low effort posts and banning people who post repeatedly without putting any effort into it. At the same time, let us all look for real opportunities, post legitimate due diligence and share real reasons that these opportunities can materialize into money for everyone.

Let's use this 15 min of fame as an opportunity to work together to improve our community, make more money, and improve the quality of the content for everyone!

Some news about FCEL, DKNG, PENN and other stock market news for today.**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! First of all, I wanted to wish to everyone happiness, peace and prosperity this upcoming Christmas, hope you are all doing well, Merry Christmas everyone.

And let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/syhtLB9) leading the way, finishing up .38%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4bcpsq) also barely finishing in the green for the day up .07% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/XtPLRkZ) finishing in the red .29%.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/1MHj5jB) dropping again today by 3.8% despite being even lower but seeing a pop in the last hours of trading with a spike of more than 4% with more uncertainty being created in the Congress after Trump [vetoed](https://ibb.co/7RpRq4W) the defense bill, as he continued to distract the attention from the big number of [pardons](https://ibb.co/pn5ZGcn) he keeps giving out, with the latest round bringing the total to almost 50 in the past week.

More than 60% of the companies were gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/wB1W5gZ) with over 200 new highs, but the volume was relatively low in this shortened trading week, as 8 of the 11 SP [sectors](https://ibb.co/tDMkjKc) were gaining yesterday with Energy and Financials gaining more than 1.6% with Financials gaining a boost as the [Treasury](https://ibb.co/XFcwxzV) yields pushed up and the curve continues to steepen, while the laggards were Real Estate, Technology and Utilities as value plays especially small and mid-caps outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/J3LB8fZ), with the large-cap growth companies finishing the day down by more than half a percent.

You can see this exact thing in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/QJ78SkH)  as the 3 biggest companies in the world, Apple, Amazon & Microsoft, finished the day down more than 0.6%. You can also see that most of the gains were concentrated in the banks and oil & gas industry while the rest of the market was pretty much mixed with companies like Tesla, Google, Facebook having small gains, while others like Zoom, Netflix, Airbnb and many more suffered.

Yesterday we also got the AAII [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/phzNq0d) that shows how investors were feeling last week. This time we don‚Äôt get any good news as this is a contrarian indicator, as people started to move from a bearish sentiment to a more neutral sentiment with more than 4% of investors moving from a bearish view to a neutral view, with only a .1% increase in bullish investors last week, as the stimulus bill seemed to be finally agreed on before Trump making new headlines this week again with the Veto of the NDAA.

Meanwhile we also got tons of economic data yesterday starting with initial and continuing [jobless](https://ibb.co/bg8K6Dt) claims as initial claims came in way [lower](https://ibb.co/n81QxT6) than expected just over 800K, down almost 90K from the previous week and falling to a 3-week low, with the continuing jobless claims also dropping to 5.3M, lower than last week and what was expected from the analysts.

We also saw the durable goods [number](https://ibb.co/DYN5hkb) coming in better than expected with a .9% increase, up for the 7th straight month, while house [PRICES](https://ibb.co/DKms26p) rose nationwide by 1.5% in October from the previous month, which continued to push house prices higher by more than 10% since last year, with home [SALES](https://ibb.co/xhLcYy5) falling in November but are still up over 20% year over year as the median sales price of new houses continued to trend up.

Alongside this we saw the final consumer sentiment read slipping in [December](https://ibb.co/GV1yS3f) to 80.7, lower than expected but higher than the 76.9 in November, with the November Personal [INCOME](https://ibb.co/0QCHRdN) coming worse than expected, losing 1.1% from the previous month.

In contrast, [today](https://ibb.co/74kjcZD) we don‚Äôt really get any critical economic data and the stock market closes early.

So, we saw Nikola take another stumble [yesterday](https://ibb.co/319S2TR), after the whole Apple & Tesla [disruption](https://ibb.co/n897DvD) as we saw the stocks drop more than 10% again yesterday and is down more than 26% since I made my prediction and just hit my first price target, here is the link to that [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/k4l70a/tesla_news_nio_sales_nikola_stock_crash_stock/).

Nikola shares skid [yesterday](https://ibb.co/zhjQhMq) again after another deal for the company fell, as  that meant the termination of the deal with Republic Services to develop an electric garbage truck for them. The deal was expected to have Nikola produce over 2500 trucks for the company. So, I would trim my sell position on Nikola here, while leaving some for my next target, with that target being a drop in the single digits in the future for the company.

In contrast to Nikola, we saw FuelCell Energy [rising](https://ibb.co/59M4JB3) for a seventh straight session, this has happened after the Congress has included provisions in the relief bill to extend clean energy tax credits, and seems to be one of favorite plays in the stock market right now.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/V3JdsFX), we saw Alibaba shares plummeting again more than 8% on the Hong Kong exchange and more than 7% in pre-market in the US by [now](https://ibb.co/7VXxMCC), after more pressure has been put on the company as the Chinese authorities are continuing to pursue anti-monopolistic investigations on the company while also continuing the investigation on Ant Group which is an affiliate of Alibaba as they hold more than 1/3 of the company. I think these investigations are very likely to come out with fines and structural changes on how the company will work with its subsidiaries and affiliates, and that the high flying, record-breaking, Ant Group IPO will likely be postponed for a longer period until they meet regulators requirements as it is expected that Ant Group will be given some guidelines to follow by the [regulators](https://ibb.co/kBm5431). My personal belief is that Alibaba is a great company and it should trade higher than this, but until this whole mess with the authorities clears, anything can happen as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/ssR3Ld6), as the stock has underperformed since Ant Group canceled the IPO, with my long-term price target for Alibaba being 300$, but I wouldn‚Äôt go to heavy on this trade right now.

Enough of Alibaba, meanwhile we also saw XL Fleet jumping huge [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MP9XBv2) after the usual short-seller Citron, indicated that there is still more upside for this company.

And one final piece of [news](https://ibb.co/6Zp3qMw) is that Colorado set another record for wagers in November, this is another confirmation of the gambling tailwinds that will skyrocket companies like DraftKings & PENN Gaming higher in the next years.

Let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/QvL0MV4) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way, while the European Union and UK are finally nearing a deal for [Brexit](https://ibb.co/M9pkZxY), and remember there are only 5 trading sessions left in 2020 with today also being a short-day of trading.

Also, don‚Äôt forget this is usually when one of the best 7-day period for gains happens, with an [average](https://ibb.co/QbcDDrh) return of 1.33% and a 77% chance of that happening since 1950. But be careful, not every year is a winner, you can see [here](https://ibb.co/16STGsc) some examples, with 1999 being a very bad year as the dot com bubble approached, with another bad year coinciding with the start of the financial crisis. Hopefully this will be the 5th straight year with a positive return in this period.

772,"Daily Market Recap - Friday, December 18, 2020",1608357073.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 18, 2020**

Stocks fell Friday, one day after the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) recorded new intraday highs. Market participants were disappointed by the weekly unemployment report, which unexpectedly saw new jobless claims rise to the highest level since September, but remain hopeful the grim data will compel lawmakers to pass more virus-related stimulus. 

This Friday marked a quarterly event known as the quadruple witching, during which stock index futures and options, and single equity futures and options, all expire on the same day. This tends to cause trading volumes to spike. This S&P 500 is also set for a major rebalance with the index set to include Tesla, the largest company ever to be added by market cap, in the index by Monday, December 21.

On Thursday, the Labor Department also released its Weekly Unemployment report, which showed a second straight increase in the number of first-time unemployment claims. 880,000 Americans filed for new unemployment claims, much higher than the 818,000 expected. The increase in unemployment is likely a result of the new restrictions being placed throughout the country in response to the recent surge in coronavirus. 

Despite optimistic words from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the possibility of a no-deal scenario and a partial government shutdown is still on the table. Senate Majority Whip John Thune suggested Thursday that the government could go into a partial shutdown over the weekend if lawmakers are unable to agree on the details of both the government spending bill and the virus-relief attached to it. Yesterday, McConnell said, ‚Äúlawmakers made major headway toward hammering out a targeted pandemic relief‚Äù and that ‚Äúwe \[Senators\] have agreed we will not leave town until we‚Äôve made law.‚Äù Hopefully, lawmakers are finally able to come together and pass additional and much-needed economic relief.

In good news, more progress was made on the vaccine front after the Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs (FDA) advisory panel voted to recommend that Moderna‚Äôs (MRNA) coronavirus vaccine candidate be authorized for emergency use. This would be the second inoculation to be granted emergency use authorization in the US. Pfizer‚Äôs (PFE) vaccine has already begun to be distributed across the US.

But all of you new guys arriving here over the past few days need to understand something:

I walk into a casino, sit a slot machine, pull the handle and hit a jackpot. I tell you to try it, so you pull the handle and hit a smaller jackpot! It seems that this particular machine is paying out! Now there are a crowd of people all taking turns, pulling the handle and getting  paid!

The casino manager sees this, he closes down the casino to investigate.

Upon reopening the casino, the slot machine is no longer paying, but people are still trying.

All of us here, all of wsb and reddit are just the customers in the casino. Even our combined buying power is just a drop in the ocean compared to the leverage that institutions can access.

The GME story caught them off guard, it was a unique situation that is not easily repeatable.

Now that the hedge funds have had time to analyze and understand the situation, the algos have been adjusted and with every passing day the odds of the little guy winning here are dropping dramatically!

778,I did a simple bootstrap analysis to compare the performance of the NASDAQ-100 and the S&P 500,1594568683.0,"I took the price of each index on January 1st of each year. I then calculated the percentage change per year for each year. I assumed these percentage changes per year were random and represented samples from the true distribution of percentage changes per year (assuming such a distribution exists). Next, I sampled with replacement 30 years of percentages changes and calculated what $x would be worth 30 years later. I repeated this process 10\^6 times.

For the NASDAQ-100, I took all the available data, from January 1st 1986 to January 1st 2020. For the S&P 500, I also took all available data, from January 1st 1928 to January 1st 2020. However, I also restricted the dataset to start from January 1st 1986 in order to compare it to the NASDAQ-100. Here are the results for 10\^6 investments, all over 30 years:

NASDAQ-100

Minimum yearly return: -11.98%

Mean yearly return: 16.95%

Median yearly return: 13.29%

Maximum yearly return: 43.36%

5th percentile yearly return: 4.47%

1st percentile yearly return: 0.87%

S&P 500 (1928 to 2020)

Minimum yearly return: -13.81%

Mean yearly return: 7.72%

Median yearly return: 5.95%

Maximum yearly return: 22.43%

5th percentile yearly return: -0.42%

1st percentile yearly return: -3.15%

S&P 500 (1986 to 2020)

Minimum yearly return: -9.63%

Mean yearly return: 9.73%

Median yearly return: 8.50%

Maximum yearly return: 21.46%

5th percentile yearly return: 2.97%

1st percentile yearly return: 0.54%

I repeated the analyses a few times to check that the results were robust, which they were.

This bootstrap analysis relies on some admittedly dubious assumptions. It relies on the assumptions that there is some ""true"" distribution of percentage changes per year, that percentage changes per year are random, independent and all come from the same distribution and that past performance is an indicator of future performance, which of course may not be accurate.

Edit: Oops! I accidentally bootstrapped without replacement, when I wanted to bootstrap with replacement. I have fixed this now.

779,Tesla beats earnings +650$ After hrs,1580383094.0,"Tesla Inc. stock rallied 12% late Wednesday after the Silicon Valley car maker reported quarterly earnings that topped Wall Street views and set a goal to ‚Äúcomfortably‚Äù sell more than 500,000 vehicles this year.

Tesla¬†TSLA+2.49%¬†¬†said it earned $105 million, or 56 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $140 million, or 78 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned $2.14 a share, compared with $2 a share a year ago.


Revenue rose 2% to $7.4 billion, compared with $7.2 billion a year ago.

Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the car maker to report adjusted earnings of $1.77 a share on sales of $7 billion.

The after-hours share surge continued as Tesla hosted its conference call with investors, and a mention of potential delays in the Model 3 production in Shanghai due to the deadly coronavirus did nothing to temper investors‚Äô enthusiasm.

Stocks traded higher throughout the day before pulling back steeply in the last hour of trading in another extremely volatile day. While major benchmarks are up around 4% in the last five trading days, intraday volatility has been extreme, making options trading difficult. Traders weighed a wild presidential debate and developments among Congressional lawmakers for further fiscal stimulus. Stocks recovered in the last 20 minutes of the market, capping off an extremely volatile final hour.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.68% up, the S&P (SPY) finished the day 0.59% up, and the Dow (DIA) led the day finishing 0.99% up. 

Yesterday‚Äôs presidential debate between Pres. Trump and Joe Biden proved to be an extremely contentious affairs, with Trump frequently interrupting both Biden the moderator, Chris Wallace who could not control the candidates, and a slew of highly personal attacks from both sides. The Guardian branded the debate ‚Äòa national humiliation‚Äô. With the election in 36 days, analysts expect volatility to increase as November 3rd gets closer. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said ‚ÄúI think markets are really nervous into those 36 days \[before the election\] and one of the things we have to think about is, when does nervousness price in the worst is yet to come? When do you think the worst is priced in? There‚Äôs $4.3 trillion in cash on the sidelines. I don‚Äôt think in the history of any financial market in the world do you ever have a top when there‚Äôs 20% of the equity market sitting in cash. Investor cash ‚Äî that‚Äôs excluding the private equity cash, the record cash held by corporates too. So you‚Äôve got tons of dry powder. People are bearish.‚Äù

The election comes against a dire economic situation, especially in the labor, with major corporations recently announcing new rounds of job cuts. Disney (DIS) announced it was slashing 28,000 jobs in their theme parks, cruise line, and retailers. Shell (RDS) announced it was cutting 9,000 jobs as the pandemic has affected the demand for oil. According to CNN business, tens of thousands of airline jobs could be lost as soon as tomorrow, as a federal prohibition on job cuts in the industry expires. Airline executives say they are prepared to keep workers only if Congress approves $25 billion in grants. 

Congressional lawmakers and the Trump administration are attempting to come to a deal in the near-term to provide additional fiscal relief to the families and small businesses that are struggling in the pandemic. House Democrats are pushing forward with a new $2.2 trillion proposal as speaker Pelosi and the White House make a final attempt to strike a deal before the election. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin were unable to strike a deal after a 90-minute meeting. The pair said they will continue discussion as they continue to work to craft legislation that could pass both Houses of Congress. House Democrats are holding a vote on their plan today, a largely symbolic gesture as McConnel has already opposed the plan. Republicans are rumored to have a $1-1.5 trillion ceiling for any new relief legislation.

And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more & more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it‚Äôs one of the best for long-term investing.

[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED‚Äôs Beige Book.

While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it‚Äôs unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production & airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it‚Äôs not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.

We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell & hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell & hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It‚Äôs expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services & selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It‚Äôs seems a good & interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.

In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK‚Äôs Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren‚Äôt good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan & others.

We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.

So, let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.

805,Lessons from 2020,1609738004.0,"&#x200B;

Hi All,

I debated if I should make this post but I thought it might help one or two new kids who are new to investing. If you think it's useless down vote it and I will delete it.

At the beginning of 2020 I was just like most of you was not a member of WSBs and invested on my own accord. All that changed in February. I opened an active trading account for fun. I joined reddit and figured I should get involved with the community so that we make money together. Here are the lessons that I think would help some of newer guys than me. Also here is my performance in my speculative account which was opened in March 2020. **828% cumulative return.** 

[https://preview.redd.it/tglxuc9hn6961.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8e660dd59a5118b5cd8c1046bce9dc3f2094e20](https://preview.redd.it/tglxuc9hn6961.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8e660dd59a5118b5cd8c1046bce9dc3f2094e20)

**Lesson 1: Consistency Matters**

My goal with this speculative account was to try different strategies but get consistent returns nonetheless. I aimed to not have any down months. This helps alleviate the mental anguish caused by roller-coaster-type portfolios. As my mama told me 5 years ago, you are playing with hard-earned-money. This is why I stayed away from YOLOing the whole account on few select plays. I aimed to have many different bets going on at the same time.

**Lesson 2: Helping others is harder than earning money.**

My dad opened a speculation account at the same in March. I decided that I would help him have a similar performance as mine. I kept on feeding him info about my trades. What did he do? Most of the times he thought I was retarded and called the local hospital for me. When Boeing dropped to $93, I was on the phone telling him this is free money. I told him to by $30k but he just bought $10k. I was buying American Airlines on the same day. This story repeated many times over the last 9 month. I think at the end he managed to scratch of \~250%. Now I have him on a conservative buy and hold strategy since he is not cut out to actively trade. And by actively I mean 4 trades a week for him.

**Lesson 3: Having a good broker is important**

If you haven't deleted Robinhood and gotten your self a proper broker after you hearing or experiencing bugs, crashes, service outages, your data being sold, .... then I don't know if I can convince you. Other brokers will give you access to ADRs and allow you invest in some bigger European companies that are trading OTC here.

**Lesson 4: Don't argue with people; instead discuss ideas.**

If you notice someone is arguing instead of discussing ideas with you then just ignore them. For every seller of a stock there is a buyer. There is no point in personally attacking people. If you believe strongly that they are wrong, then just inverse their trade. Respect and thank them for sharing their trades with you, even if you disagree with them.

**Lesson 5: Media is a hype machine**

CNBC, Bloomberg, ... are all in the business of creating excitement and increasing their viewership. They are not there to enhance your returns. What gets people's attention is usually not a good investment.

**Lesson 6: Reddit slaps you harder than a twisted tea**

I used to share ALL my DDs here. Sharing is caring, right? apparently not. There was no shortage of personal attacks, being banned, DDs being deleted, ... My Karma even dropped to -1k in March. I am permanently banned from r/ investing, economics, .... I got temporary banned here, and two other investing subs. So I post less DDs now, and don't try to stop people from jumping from rooftops.

**Lesson 7: Most popular posts/users should not be blindly mimicked**

Most people including me already know this, but I keep seeing it here. I figured I should mention it since I have your attention. When you see a trade that is getting a lot of attention ask yourself: does this fit my strategy? If not then don't do it. What is strategy you ask? oh boy

**Lesson 8: Don't let survivor bias fool you**

Everyday people on WSB are throwing millions of dollars on thousands of small bets. The odds are some of them are gonna pay of. So when you see some guy posting Gain-porn of 1k turning to 100k overnight. Remember that over night thousands of other people with similar bets lost it all. So don't just follow people blindly. Some of the most respected guys here are essentially doing the same thing by YOLOing all their money on one bet that unfolds over several month. These guys last longer but essentially are playing few bets game. When you roll the dice 5 times the odds of you getting 5 in a row is a lot. There is a reason we don't hear from YungBillionaire anymore. Please don't Yolo your whole account on GME, Palantir, and such.

**Lesson 9: Reddit is skews the information you see**

Not all the best ideas are popular and not all the popular ideas are good. lol

**Lesson 10: When the tide goes out you realize who was swimming naked.**

Popularized by WB, he wasn't the one who came up with it. When a correction happens, and I guarantee you there will be a correction, then you realize who was blindly chasing alpha without any risk management. The correction may not come for a few years but there always is a correction, pullback for some random reason. So **manage your risk.** Guh

**Lesson 11: unless you have insider info do not buy weekly or even monthly options.**

LEAPs are risky as well but can be managed. Most people here should not take the weekly or monthly option risk. You need years of experience before doing so.

**Lesson 12: Paper accounts don't count.**

You need real money to be at risk so that you care and go through the emotions. I never had a paper account and if you are using one, in my opinion you are wasting your time.

**Lesson 13: No one has a magic sauce.**

Those who pretend to do are delusional. There is no such thing as ""always do this and you will win"". Market changes and strategies that work now will not work in 2 month. If a guru says buy x, y and z and you will make money, that's total BS.

**Lesson 14: If you get money help yourself and your family**

You have the option Yoloing your money on weeklys, buy coke, or elevating your life. Money truly brings happiness. Only people who don't have it think that it does not; and site a bs study. Use your money to help your family at key points in their lives. Help with their Mortgage down payment, buy a car for the ones who really need them,... Use your money to work less and work out more. Yolo in real life, not on options.

**Lesson 15: If you don't invest with conviction, you won't get the results that matter**

You have to know why you are buying some stock and why you would sell it. A lot of winning trades will go against you before they go green. To hold those positions when deep in the red, you gotta have conviction in your thesis.

I am not going to edit this post because it will mess up it's format. I am going to put a comment below with updates/corrections. Also do NOT message me personally. I don't have a magic sauce.",2021-01-03 22:26:44
806,AirBNB & DoorDash IPOs | CHEWY & GameStop EARNINGS | APPLE news| STOCK MARKET NEWS [12-09],1607549715.0,"**Chewy crushes earnings reports, while GameStop disappoints. What is the latest news on Apple and the new AirPods Max? Should we buy AirBNB or DoorDash when they launch tomorrow? Let‚Äôs talk about this and more about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/8zQQ165) leading the way up half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9pFmQ0X) up .28%, both of them closing at new record highs with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/bbsbdqM) also up .35% to close Tuesday. The [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MPVyNn) also showed a steady decline through the day as it dropped almost 3%. This moves in the market were caused by the [latest](https://ibb.co/Lnr5Q3X) hopes for a stimulus deal to be agreed on by the end of current session in congress as there seems to be a lot of ground on which parties can agree on. Things have gotten worse in the economy since this hole stimulus talk has been going around, so, if both parties would have been more willing to give up some ground, people would have already gotten more support and we would probably be talking about other bills or measures that would have helped even more. So, maybe this [latest](https://ibb.co/w4LYBk9) Mnuchin proposal with maybe minor tweaks would be the best chance of anything happening by the end of this year.

We saw more companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/R9N61kK) as over 3 thousand companies were moving up, continuing the huge bull run started in November as more than 84% of companies are moving above the 50 and 200-day moving averages. The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/hLpbcrx) yesterday were Energy and Health Care while Real Estate and Utilities lagged behind as Large-Cap Growth companies were the only company factor [analysis](https://ibb.co/zbJd6m2) that lost ground yesterday, with small-caps, especially small-cap growth companies largely outperforming the markets.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hcMmt7x) that there were gains to be made yesterday in a lot of parts of the stock market, with only a few big red spots on the map.

[Today](https://ibb.co/RgSDj55) we will get some numbers on the November Job [openings](https://ibb.co/VLVz771), MBA mortgage applications and Petroleum inventories. 

While we got some earnings yesterday from Chewy which dazzled again in [earnings](https://ibb.co/Jd7Scx1) with the only small miss coming in net sales per customer, but as the number of customers keeps increasing, this might continue to go down, as not every pet owner spends the same amount of big money on pets. The company [reported](https://ibb.co/WVndSgJ) an EBITDA of $5.5M vs a loss of over $9M expected with the gross margin increasing to over 25% while also giving great [guidance](https://ibb.co/h8BPK2W) for Q4 of $1.94B to $1.96B vs less than $1.8B expected by analysts.

The company also turned around to a positive [cash flow](https://ibb.co/ys3NVTc) of over $30M. I really like this company and I expected it to be a good own at least for the next quarter until they reach more hard earnings comps next year.

Meanwhile, as I expected GameStop had another bad [quarter](https://ibb.co/DWP4jZh) despite beating some earnings estimates with a smaller loss than expected, the revenue still continued to drop over 30% on a year over year basis while comps where even worse missing the expectations by quite a margin. 

Though e-commerce sales rose by more than 250% in Q3, this did not offset the comparable store sales. Margins also declined with hardware margins being the biggest reasons why. I think this company has a very though challenge on its hands with e-commerce being such a though place to compete in, I think the shift to online has been delayed for this company and I think it will struggle to survive, even though it might see a boost next quarter from the sales of the new gaming consoles that were released last month from both Sony and Microsoft.  [GME EARNINGS HIGHLIGHTS](https://ibb.co/SymxCtK)

I wouldn‚Äôt touch this [stock](https://ibb.co/K0cN5ds) as I think there are far better plays out there than betting on this struggling company.

The only company that I am interested today which will release earnings results is [ADOBE](https://ibb.co/d5SBbyX) which is expected to have the best results ever for the company with an increase of over 12% in both EPS and Revenues. Last go around despite posting great results, the stock fell more than 4% in September and have just recovered to that price point. I expect it this time to go higher and stay that way if they manage to deliver the best quarter on the books.

Meanwhile [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/FgJ5k7z) is pricing its initial public offering at over 100$/share which I believe is ridiculous, and it is an flat out joke of a valuation, this company has benefited a ton from this economy and still, this valuation implies that they will have over 50% of the total addressable market not in the US, but in the WORLD in the next couple of years, I don‚Äôt think this is a good investment opportunity, they will have increasing competition that offer the same thing for free or cheaper, this is a very though business to try and take over as one single company. People will also be way more likely to start going to restaurants maybe not in 2021 but for sure starting 2022 or whenever the vaccines are widely available in the entire world. I wouldn‚Äôt touch this stock at such high valuations, especially over 110$, even if I was looking for short-term gains which might end up being the case, I think there are better opportunities out there.

In contrast to DoorDash, I might be interested to buy some AirBNB if the price is right after the [IPO](https://ibb.co/RBDhWW0), I think it will have a much better future, as personally I really like to rent out apartments or homes whenever I go on a vacation rather than a traditional hotel. And even though it might have a tough Q4 and Q1 next year, I expect by Q2 next year more people will be vaccinated, so more people will start and go out and travel, and with especially low comps for next year as bookings are way down in 2020 this might make the company look much more attractive by this time next year. So, between DoorDash and AirBNB, I clearly like AirBNB a whole damn lot more.

In other IPO news, [RBNHD](https://ibb.co/WyJs5vQ) is expected to go public as soon as Q1 next year as they seek a valuation of over $20B.

Some other [Boeing](https://ibb.co/6rN04h6) came for companies like Boeing which made its first 737 MAX delivery since the ban ended, as it is expected to start rolling out deliveries and upgrades for current planes at a very good rate with more good news coming from the UK which will suspend the tariffs imposed on US Goods.

While [PENN](https://ibb.co/qJhKxGY) gaming ran to an all-time high yesterday after news that sports betting may be launched in Michigan as early as six weeks from now, as legalization of gambling is moving faster and faster in the US, this also bolds well for DraftKings and other gambling stocks.

Also, [ETSY](https://ibb.co/F0vsdmD) keeps getting upgrades from analysts as they are expected to have a great Q4 suggested from the most recent November sales data.

And finally let‚Äôs talk about Apple, as they just [revealed](https://ibb.co/dKrwT6j) the new AirPods Max headphone yesterday, with a huge price tag of 549$, this seemed to gain a pretty bad reaction from [consumers](https://ibb.co/CJ8DkLR) as [they](https://ibb.co/xz2HDXx) complained about the huge price tag with competitors like Bose and others selling similar headphones for 350$ or less. These headphones, also have a bigger price tag than even the new PS5 videogame console so we will have to wait and see if this is a successful product from Apple, I think they have gone a little overboard with the price, but rich people do tend to pay a premium for brand names. This can also be seen in the [latest](https://ibb.co/By3F6jS) analyst call from JPMorgan as customers appear to favor high end models as delivery times have been increasing for the 12 Pro and 12 PRO MAX. 

On the better side of things for Apple, the [Fitness+](https://ibb.co/Kh3KnQg) service is expected to launch on the 14th of December and it will cost $9.99/month or $79.99$/year. I expect this to be a better success for the company and to drive an even more stable increase of revenues, as subscription-based revenues are better than one-time sales. 

So, I still like this company the most in the long-term and it might see a spike in the near future, especially moving closer to Q4 results and earnings. Apple is still the biggest position in my portfolio and I am not planning on changing that anytime soon.

Good luck to everyone in the stock market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/q7rHvL5) are mixed while writing this post with the DOW and SP500 gaining ground while the Nasdaq futures are just down for the moment.

807,Investing in TSX: $WELL OTC:WLYYF,1620114799.0,"Hey  guys, I have been watching this Canadian Telehealth company WELL Health  Technologies over the last few months and wanted to get some opinions  from the rest of you. I first became aware of them when I saw Mr. Li  Ka-Shing (the 29th richest man) invest $105M of a $305M round priced at a  25% premium to market. Since then I have seen 2 short reports come out  against the company and I can't seem to figure out why. Having watched  them do this raise, and complete the acquisition of CRH Medical and  today ExecHealth which will bring their revenue to $300M with $50M in  free cash flow with $0 debt and $80M left in the bank. I can't  understand why not one but two short reports against them have been  released‚Ä¶

Some reasons I am looking at them:

* \- Founded by a successful Entrepreneur who sold his previous company to PayPal for $304M
* \- Seed investor is the 29th richest man in the world and he has invested in every round since
* \-  Completed a $305M raise priced 25% above the market at the time which  again was led by the 29th richest man with over $100m of his own money
* \- CRH acquisition means they will have close to or over $300M in revenue and over $50M in free cash flow
* \-  $0 debt $80m in cash?
* \- Truly proving themselves to be a leader in what will be a $289B Telehealth market.
* \- Undervalued compared to any of the US names I have¬†found

808,Stocks to Watch 05/02/2021,1612563344.0,"Good morning,

Yesterday was a crazy day with AACG showing some ridiculous moves on the upside. Congratulations to those of you who managed to catch it. That said, there are equally stocks like CPSH which temporarily show potential and then flash-crash down, so be careful out there. Here is my watchlist for today:

1. **$LAIX (LAIX Inc) -** I can't see a catalyst with this stock, but it's made some crazy moves pre-market. Similar to AACG, this is an ADR based in China and this is very likely another 'pump/dump' like we have seen a lot lately.
2. **$JG(Aurora Mobile)** \- This is another ADR but does actually have a catalyst, which seems to be an announced partnership with Kuaishou to increase monetisation efficiency. This has ripped up in the last 20 minutes and at it's all-time-high. One to watch, this will be our leading gapper going into the open at this rate.
3. **AAME (Atlantic American)** \- We've seen this rip up a few hours ago and then followed by a selloff, but it keeps testing the VWAP (currently acting as resistance) which shows promise. A break of this VWAP and a push through $5 would definitely attract a lot of attention.

Other stocks I will be watching: STG, AREC, KRKR, TTOO (High float), TDC (High float)

As a reminder, trading is risky, make sure you put stops in place and follow your initial plan regardless.

Have a good weekend.

809,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, December 2, 2020. Please enjoy!",1606972715.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 2, 2020**

The market rallied throughout the session after opening in the red, with the indexes holding near-record levels, with market participants optimistic that the approval and distribution of a vaccine could come relatively soon. Coronavirus cases in the United States are still on the rise, unfortunately. 

In recent weeks, investors have been cheering positive vaccine developments from companies like Pfizer (PFE), Moderna (MRNA), and AstraZeneca (AZN), fueling optimism that distribution of an effective medical solution for COVID-19 is coming relatively soon. Moderna and Pfizer have already submitted their vaccines to European and American health administrations for emergency use authorization. According to CBS News, during a conference call, Vice President Mike Pence told state governors that distribution of a vaccine could begin as early as mid-December. According to audio obtained by CBS News, Vice Presiden Pence said, ‚ÄúWe strongly believe the vaccine distribution process could begin as soon as the week of December 14. With the news that Moderna is joining Pfizer in submitting for emergency use authorization, we continue to be on pace.‚Äù

Unfortunately, the number of patients hospitalized with COVID set another record, with the Center of Disease Control (CDC) Director warning of difficult times ahead if the curve is not flattened again soon. As of yesterday, there are more than 98,000 people hospitalized, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Hospital systems across the nations are warning they are reaching capacity and are lacking resources. In response, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC warned, ""The reality is, December and January and February are going to be rough times. I actually believe they're going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that's going to be put on our health care system.‚Äù

Yesterday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers unveiled a new $908 billion targeted stimulus. The lawmakers say their plan aims to find common ground on some of the most pressing issues, and it could be used as a framework for the next stimulus package. The bill includes money for local and state governments, additional business protections, and to fund vaccine research and distribution. House Speaker Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have both supported the bill. It is unlikely any sort of bill will pass through Congress but we will keep you updated surrounding this situation.

Highlights

* The UK became the first country to approve Pfizer‚Äôs (PFE) coronavirus vaccine.
* Salesforce (CRM) fell more than 9% after the company announced it would be purchasing workplace messaging software company Slack (WORK) in its largest-ever deal valued at $27.7 billion, confirming a week‚Äôs worth of media reports over the tie-up. The announcement coincided with Salesforce‚Äôs third-quarter earnings results, which topped estimates, though its fourth-quarter profit guidance disappointed.
* United Parcel Service (UPS) was forced to impose shipping restrictions on some large retailers such as Gap Inc. and Nike Inc. this week, an early sign that the pandemic-fueled online shopping season is stretching delivery networks to their limits. UPS is metering the flow of packages into its network to preserve its performance during one of the busiest shipping weeks of the year. 
   * Fedex (FDX) has followed suit to an extent by increasing shipping prices and holding merchants to volume agreements
* Alphabet (GOOG) announced the acquisition of Actifo, a company that specializes in data back-up and recovery in the event of a disaster
* Salesforce (CRM) target increase by JMP Securities from $272 to $282 at OUTPERFORM
* Fate Therapeutics (FATE) target raised by Barclays from $60 to $70 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock currently around $61.
* NetApp (NTAP) target raised by Credit Suisse from $54 to $64 at OUTPERFORM. Stock gained 10% for the day to close at $59
* Peleton (PTON) target raised by Needham & Co. from $125 to $140 at BUY. Stock rallied to $117 intra day and closed even at $112
* Red Rock Resorts $RRR target raised by Macquarie from $28 to $30. Stock currently around $22
* Suncor $SU target raised by Barclays from $29 to $31. Very notable because stock only around $16.
* UnitedHealth Group $UNH with multiple target bullish price target increases from notable analysts. Average price target around $375 and rating of OVERWEIGHT
* Children‚Äôs Place (PLCE) was up almost 8% on the day after Wedbush increased price target to $48 from $32 yesterday

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning!

First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market!

So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.

We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy & Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla & TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.

Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull‚Äôs camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn‚Äôt get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn‚Äôt avoid getting into those.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations.

Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.

Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.

The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.

We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November‚Äôs advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.

[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.

We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger & pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more & more SUVs and Trucks to the market.

Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray & Aphria.

Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it‚Äôs first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn‚Äôt experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more than 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.

And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don‚Äôt really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.

Let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.

813,Investors baffled by soaring stocks in ‚Äòmonster‚Äô depression,1587794284.0,"Gap between financial markets and global economy yawns wider

[As per FT](https://www.ft.com/content/10d24f35-dee9-4991-a7bd-51be9097a100)

The divergence between the flying stock market and the dying economy is so extreme it is leaving many analysts scrambling for explanations.

The recent string of economic data releases reflecting life under global coronavirus lockdowns has been even grimmer than expected, spurring the IMF this week to forecast the biggest global recession since the 1930s‚Äô Great Depression.

Some investors are in awe at the scale of the shock.¬†‚ÄúWe really are in uncharted territory,‚Äù said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ‚ÄúWe have a monster mash-up of the Great Depression in size, the crash of 1987 in speed, and 9-11 attack in terms of fear.‚Äù

And yet, stock markets have been on a tear for a month. What was once dismissed as a mere ‚Äúbear market rally‚Äù ‚Äî often strong but ultimately doomed bounces that can occur in the middle of severe downturns ‚Äî has now turned into a 23 per cent jump for global stocks. Technically, that qualifies as a new bull market.¬†

The rise has erased half the stock market‚Äôs fall since late February, and brought the FTSE All-World index back to levels seen in the US tax cut-fuelled summer rally of 2017. Analysts and investors say that global efforts by central banks to soothe the financial system have been the trigger.

Citigroup estimates that the biggest central banks will buy $5tn of bonds this year, led by the US Federal Reserve, which is more than twice the size of the stimulus seen at the peak of the 2008-09 financial crisis. The Fed has even charged into areas once thought untouchable for central banks, announcing plans to support corporate debt graded ‚Äújunk‚Äù by credit rating agencies.

Throw in various other liquidity injections and a series of government spending packages aimed at ameliorating the effects of measures taken to contain the coronavirus outbreak, and the overall stimulus bill comes to $14tn, according to the IMF.¬†

‚ÄúThe Fed has been very clear that it will do whatever it takes,‚Äù said Joyce Chang, chair of global research at JPMorgan. ‚ÄúThe question is whether this will be enough.‚Äù

Many investors seem to think so. Technology stocks are once again leading the rally, but even travel and leisure stocks have jumped 24 per cent from the lows, trimming their decline this year to 37 per cent. Investors appear to be writing off 2020, focusing instead on the prospects for an economic normalisation in 2021, analysts say.¬†

Some of the technical forces that fuelled the sell-off are also helping stoke the comeback. Hedging by banks, trading strategies that automatically buy when volatility simmers down, and thinner liquidity are all now supporting the rally, according to JPMorgan.¬†

History also offers some encouragement to the optimists. Bespoke Investment Group crunched the numbers on every big US stock market slump, and found that once equities had clawed back over half their losses, that had tended to signal that the lows would not be retested.¬†

One notable exception, however, was after the crash of 1929 and the Great Depression. The US stock market rallied over 44 per cent from the November 1929 low through to March 1930 before sliding another 80 per cent, and did not reclaim its 1929 highs until September 1954.

Some investors think this is a plausible scenario now. Paul Singer, the head of Elliott Management, warned that stocks could easily renew their slide and drop by half from the February peak.

‚ÄúDespite the massive stimulus moves around the world and the unimaginably large new rounds of money printing, there is substantial uncertainty about the future viability of a large range of businesses,‚Äù Mr Singer wrote, in a recent letter to clients. ‚ÄúTo us there does not appear to be a gilded cornucopia of shining bargains.‚Äù

Some nervousness began to creep back into markets this week, triggered by ructions in the oil market¬†crowned by the unprecedented sight of the benchmark US crude price sliding below zero on Monday. Although partly a technical dislocation, it¬†underscored the fragile state of the global economy.¬†

Meanwhile, the first-quarter corporate earnings season has started to reveal the extent of the revenue destruction hitting many companies. And such grim results may pale next to what is likely to be a ‚Äúhorrific‚Äù second quarter, warns Karen Ward, a strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management.

The message was hammered home by data released on Thursday showing another 4.4m Americans claiming unemployment benefits, taking the total since mid-March to over 26m. A potential antiviral drug for coronavirus failed its first randomised clinical trial, further denting sentiment.

Ms Sonders points out that even if equities do not plunge below the lows of March, economic downturns of this magnitude tend to produce a lot of head-fake rallies and stomach-churning sell-offs.¬†

‚ÄúAnyone who thinks we‚Äôre going to keep moving up in a straight line is living in la-la land,‚Äù she warned.¬†",2020-04-24 22:58:04

(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is starting to use its network of retail stores as distribution centers for shipping products to consumers, joining a trend popularized by other retailers.

The Cupertino, California-based technology giant has typically shipped devices like iPhones, Macs, iPads, and accessories from warehouses located across a customer‚Äôs region or directly from China. Now items that are in stock can be shipped directly to consumers from a network of almost 300 retail stores spread across the U.S. and Canada, according to people familiar with the matter.

Apple told staff the shift will mean faster delivery times for customers who live further from distribution centers than from stores, according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing internal policies. The products will be shipped through United Parcel Service Inc. in Canada and FedEx Corp. in the U.S. via ground shipping and may be delivered as early as the day after a customer‚Äôs order, Apple told its staff.

828,"Psycho Market Recap - Friday, October 16, 2020",1602908178.0,"Summary

Stocks traded mostly sideways today to end the day slightly negative as investors weighed disappointing news on the stimulus front, a challenging reopening with some places being forced to go back on partial quarantine measures, and a US election which is now less than 3 weeks away.

For the day the SPY was down 0.07%, the QQQ down 0.57%, and the DIA incredibly up 0.37%. This price action, hints to a rotation out of the high flying names and into the reopening of the economy and more industrial names.

On the COVID front, this week was difficult as cases in the US have topped 8 Million. Furthermore, two of the vaccine frontrunners, Johnson and Johnson and Eli Lilly halted their trials due to safety and quality concerns. Also the CEO of Pfizer today stated that the company would not apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine any earlier than the third week of November.

The United States Budget Deficit has increased to a record $3.1Trillion in fiscal year 2020. In comparison to last year's, it has tripled in size, mostly due to the measures put in place in response to the COVID pandemic. As a share of GDP this represents 16%, the largest since WWII, to put this into context in the 2009 crisis it reached almost 10% at its peak. The biggest chunk of spending came as federal spending jumped 47% due to increased unemployment compensation needs. Still Fed Chair Jerome Powell as soon as last week kept warning that recovery will be fragile and more so without additional aid from Congress and added that providing too much stimulus shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, according to a report by Bloomberg.

The figures for retail sales for the month of September have been reported today and they show that US retail sales have grown for the 5th month in a row driven by strong spending in clothing, cars and sporting goods, according to a report published by MarketBeat. Sales jumped 1.9% which is more than double of the consensus estimate. ‚ÄúAmericans raced to the stores in September,‚Äù said BMO Capital Markets analyst Sal Guatieri, in a note to investors, adding that they were ‚Äúbuying just about everything in sight, especially clothing.‚Äù

In Europe things have been shaky as the U.K. faces resurgence in COVID cases, and a bumpy BREXIT negotiation. Partial quarantine measures have been put back in place, and negotiations between the U.K. and European Union will continue next week. Boris Johnson has told Bloomberg that he believes a deal is unlikely.

842,The Psychedelic Renaissance: A Case for $MNMD,1619557953.0,"The name of the company: **MindMedicine**.

All of this isn‚Äôt financial advice. I strongly recommend reading the whole post but if you're lazy there is a TL;DR at the bottom.

*About the company*

The goal of this company (and sector) is to revolutionize mental healthcare. How do they want to do this? MindMed focuses on different psychedelic drugs including Psilocybin, LSD, DMT and the Ibogaine derivative 18-MC (18-MC has huge potential in opioid withdrawal therapy and doesn‚Äôt have the side effects of Ibogaine). These drugs are currently being tested in numerous trials to ensure that the treatment methods are effective and safe, but everyone that has ever taken any kind of psychedelics knows about the immense potential which these kind of drugs have. The drugs address all kinds of mental health problems including Depression, PTSD, Anxiety and Addiction. And not one of these mental health problems is becoming less common, Corona and shit makes our mental health even worse by the day.

Are there effective drugs already on the market to treat these diseases? Not really, instead opioid addictions are growing faster than ever and there is no real solution - apart from psychedelics. To make the treatment as individual as possible MNMD has a project called ""Albert"" where they work with AI/machine learning, this is really a big factor because they are already getting all the data they need from the trials. The CEO himself has said that this is a company equally specialized in technology and in pharma. He called MindMed the ‚ÄûTesla of Mental Health‚Äú, I think this describes MindMed best. The company also has a crazy good [team](https://mindmed.co/team/), they got ex Google and Pfizer employees.

*Previous Research*

Psychedelics in the mental health sector are not a completely new idea, this topic has been researched a lot in the 1950‚Äôs and 1960‚Äôs. There are a lot of studies from that time indicating the [positive effects](https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2014/sep/02/psychedelic-psychiatry) of these drugs in patients with different mental health disorders. But because of the Criminalisation of psychedelics in the western world beginning in the 1960‚Äôs, this topic was not picked up by researchers until the 1990‚Äôs. Since then multiple studies have been made and are currently happening.

Recent studies have shown that low doses of psilocybin are as effective as the industry standard SSRIs!

[Effects of MDMA-assisted therapy](https://maps.org/research/mdma/ptsd/phase3)

*Financials*

Okay the drugs are great blabla, what about the financials tho? How can they afford these incredibly expensive trials? The answer: they got a ton of cash from previous offerings, the latest number i could find was [$161](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mindmed-announces-2020-year-end-financial-results-current-cash-balance-of-161-million-usd-203-million-cad-to-support-drug-development-pipeline-and-creation-of-psychedelic-medicine-tech-platform-301258180.html) Mio USD. This will finance the company in the coming years. Will they have to raise more money eventually? Maybe, but right now they are good. As soon as the first drugs get approved, this company will make *a lot* of money, not because they are exploitative but because the market for mental health disorders is huge (it‚Äôs about [$20 billion](https://mindmed.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MindMed-Corporate-Presentation-4.12.2021.pdf) right now and this number is growing rapidly).

*Competition*

Okay all looking beautiful, but what about the competition? What if MNMD just isn't the company that is developing the best product for the market? Let me put it this way; Mind Medicine is the undisputed leader in this emerging sector right now. The second biggest player (looking at MarketCap, trials and cash available) is Compass Pathways. There are many reasons why I personally would not invest in this company; first of all they have much fewer trials going on. If I'm already investing in a very risky company, I want to choose the one that is most likely going to succeed. And in the pharma industry you can lower that risk by investing in a company which is developing many different drugs/treatments (MindMed has over 10 trials going on, CMPS has only one), this way if one trial fails the company won't go bankrupt. Even if they only get one drug approved they will be doing great, we're still talking about a growing market worth Billions. Another thing is Compass¬¥attempt at [patenting](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7amw4/is-it-possible-to-create-an-ethical-psychedelics-company) shit like the color of the walls and other ridiculous stuff, I personally can't invest in them because of my moral standards.

*Celebrities*

Everyone investing in stocks knows that Musk's tweets are more important than fundamentals, that's why I have to mention this. Cathie Wood has heard about this, she didn‚Äôt directly say she would invest in this company but she knows about the disruptive potential of this company, and is there a more fitting stock for the ARK Innovation ETF out there? [Kevin O‚ÄòLeary](https://mobile.twitter.com/kevinolearytv/status/1385631204758728706) aka Mr. Wonderful has been supporting this company since early last year, even if you do not like him you have to admit that he has quite a lot of publicity. The company is also doing a lot of PR, with the CEO JR Rahn giving numerous interviews within the last months.

*NASDAQ*

$MNMD is the ticker.

*Further Information*

There are many catalysts coming up this year, the most important ones are obviously the trial results. The next major catalyst after Today should be the Special Meeting of the company on the 27th of May. The MNMD [homepage](https://mindmed.co/) has a great Investors section where you can find all the press releases and important dates of the company.

The shift to psychedelics in mental healthcare (100B+ industry) will be massive, there are millions of patients out there waiting for a treatment method that works! MindMed, the leader of this sector will uplist on the NASDAQ today.

I wish all of you best luck this week, may the shroom boom bless us with some nice gains.

846,Market Recap - Wed Oct 7 Please Enjoy,1602137224.0,"**Summary**

Stocks were on a run today, climbing steadily higher all the way into close, fueled by hope stemming from President Trump‚Äôs tweets on the push to approve $1,200 checks and support for Airlines.

The SPY finished up 1.73%, the QQQ up 1.8%, and the DIA up 1.85%. Additionally the small cap IWM is up 2.18% for the day, and the Biotech etf IBB closed up 2.22%.

Yesterday in the early afternoon, Trump announced that he would stop all Stimulus talks until after the election. The markets saw a very significant slide off, only recouping a bit of the losses by the close. However, later in the day, going back on his word he made two significant tweets which helped to push the markets higher today. ‚ÄúIf I am sent a Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200), they will go out to our great people IMMEDIATELY. I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy?‚Äù and the second was about the airlines ‚ÄúThe House & Senate should IMMEDIATELY Approve 25 Billion Dollars for Airline Payroll Support, & 135 Billion Dollars for Paycheck Protection Program for Small Business. Both of these will be fully paid for with unused funds from the Cares Act. Have this money. I will sign now!‚Äù

During today, Speaker Pelosi conducted an interview on ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe View‚Äù where she signaled willingness to keep discussions open, but disparaged the idea of stand-alone bills. She continues to support the idea that a one comprehensive package in the order of $2 Trillion must be passed in whole. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth said ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have time to save the economy piece by piece. As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told us, we need to act now and act big‚Äù.

It is worth noting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin have constantly been advocating that with all the Fed has done, still more direct stimulus from Congress is needed to aid with the recovery. Many feel it is unfortunate to see that the stimulus has become a ground to push political agendas, while the ones who pay the price are the regular American citizens.

Tonight there will be a vice presidential debate between Kamala Harris, and current VP Mike Pence. According to a report published by Marketwatch the stakes will be high as ""Vice President Pence must put in a strong performance against the democratic nominee, Sen Kamala Harris of California, to turn the electorate's attention away from the first presidential debate and a barrage of negative news coverage related to Trump's recent COVID-19 diagnosis and subsequent hospitalization"".

On other fronts, hotspots for Coronavirus are picking up, with the latest restrictions coming from New York. The rule will come into effect on Friday and will affect businesses, houses of worships and schools. Boston has also delayed the reopening of schools for a week. India is closing in on the US to become the country with most infections, adding 78k new cases, more than double of the US, to total 6.8M vs the 7.7M total cases in the US.

Vaccine developments continue to move forward with the White House and FDA finally on agreement on the guidelines to approve for Emergency use. Also, During the John Hopkins University Vaccine Symposium, Operation Warp Speed Chief says within next month or two ""We feel comfortable"" that we will have one or two efficacious candidates to deliver doses to 30M people by Nov or Dec 2020 as per reports on the event by Benzinga. The story on Trump‚Äôs recovery is that he has been treated with a cocktail with treatments from GILD and REGN and is currently recuperating presenting mild to no symptoms according to a report by CNBC.

850,Simple Rules for the New Day Trader in a Volatile Market,1614717810.0,"The market is behaving erratically and the volatility can catch many new traders off guard.  If you're actively trading throughout the day and you seem to be losing more than your gains, then step back and follow these basic rules to safely navigate the current market.

1. Only trade stocks that are above the 200 SMA on *all* timeframes, and above the 20 and 50 SMA on the 5 minute timeframe.
2. **Only trade stocks that are above the 50 EMA on the 1 Hour timeframe.**
3. Only trade stocks that are above the 40 RSI on *all* timeframe, and above the 50 RSI on the 1 Day timeframe.
4. Do not trade before 9:35 AM EST.  If you're absolutely new to day trading, then wait until 10:30 AM or later to trade.  Use the time to observe the market and feel how it's behaving using the SPY.
5. Only trade stocks above the VWAP.

Here are a few rules regarding risk management and position sizing:

1. Only trade stocks *after* you determine the stop loss (SL).
2. Take profit when the price hits **X \* (ENTRY - SL) + ENTRY**, where X is 2 or higher.  This is the Reward part of the Risk/Reward.
3. Do not lose more than your 1% of your trading capital, if the stock hits your stop loss.
4. Determine the amount of shares you should by based on the 1% rule using the following formula:

**Amount of Shares = 1% (or less) of Capital / (Entry - SL)**

I've created a free, open source risk management [script](https://www.tradingview.com/script/FanHP09w-Risk-Management-Position-Size-Risk-Reward/) on TradingView to help traders automate the position sizing part of the risk management strategy.

In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good

861,"Stock Market News for Today | Fubo, GM, Tesla, Ford, Lemonade, Nikola, JP Morgan &other news [12-29]",1609273623.0,"**Why did FuboTv and Lemonade crash yesterday. JP Morgan goes all-in on travel and Nikola spikes after their report. Let‚Äôs talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let‚Äôs start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/w73qSnv) leading the way, up .87%, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/6y9ZnHT) also gaining more than .7% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qnJN88J) rising by more than 200 points to finish the day, with all 3 big indexes finishing broadly higher, with all of them also closing at all-time highs, after the relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/LRcCDdL) lifted many stocks, as this bill does include direct payments and unemployment benefits while also including over $300B that will be direct to the small businesses relief funding programs alongside other good [programs](https://ibb.co/jbhM2b2), like rent assistance, child care, vaccine distribution and others. But despite this great movement in the stock market, we did see the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Hn8QrkZ) rising by almost 1%, with most factor groups trading lower [yesterday](https://ibb.co/F7dWsYS), with only large-cap growth companies gaining, while the biggest losers were in the small and mid-caps, especially the growth companies.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/Cwnvhrv) there was almost a 50/50 split in advancing to declining stocks, with 177 new highs on decent volume, as more companies have started to trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a good thing as the trend was worrying with over 84% of companies above that moving average just recently.

We also saw 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/Km2fdpd) gaining yesterday with communications, consumer discretionary and technology all gaining over 1% for the day while the 2 sectors that lost ground and lagged the market were Energy and Materials.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gr6GrMj) that confirms those charts, as we can see big gains made in the big tech names with Amazon, Facebook and Google all gaining more than 2% for the day with Netflix and Microsoft also posting a 1% gain. We can also see the biggest losers coming in the Software-Application and Biotech sectors, probably because of tons of profit taking after huge-runups this year, while funds want to show investors that they own the big names, not those very volatile high-flying stocks of 2020, maybe that is one of the reasons for this rotation.

We also saw the total people through TSA [checkpoints](https://ibb.co/ByxKmYy) in the Christmas weekend rise to over 2.4M people, the busiest since March, but that is still down about 50% since last year. This are better news for the Airlines especially after Trump also finally signed the stimulus bill which does include funds for the Airlines.

While TrueCar also released some December [estimates](https://ibb.co/KL4K7X9) for auto sales, in which we can see a 4,7% increase year over year and a 32% increase over last month, as the industry is still continuing the rebound since the March lows. This is a good outlook for the industry so expect big OEM to start rising again after a pause in companies like Ford or GM since the end of November. Regarding this subject maybe Tesla can start selling even more cars, this after an Indian minister [reported](https://ibb.co/k2W2LML) Tesla will start operations in early 2021 in the country.

Alongside great sales numbers in the auto industry, we also received the Dallas FED manufacturing [Survey](https://ibb.co/Ssdf7Kd), which came in better than expected with production, new orders and capacity utilization all having big increases since the last report.

[Today](https://ibb.co/vdHr1wT) we get some numbers from the Redbook store sales and the SP Home Price Index, while we also await to see what the Republican [Senate](https://ibb.co/261v76w) will do after the House passed the $2000 stimulus proposal, as the leader of the Senate hasn‚Äôt yet announced anything.

In some other stock market news, we saw some highly volatile names make moves with [Nikola](https://ibb.co/M8xVsvm) popping after a JP Morgan analyst predicted a less drama filled 2021, I can‚Äôt imagine what he sees in the company, as they still don‚Äôt have any new breakthrough technology or really anything to show, just promises after promises. While we also saw [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/vkkLy38) dropping more than 11% for the 2nd straight day before regaining some of the losses after-hours, this happened after it was called a best short idea at Hedgeye on top of last week short reports, and meanwhile, we also saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vVZnw9c) fall 14% after the lockup period expired after the IPO, adding more than 30M shares to the small public float available until now.

We also saw JP Morgan [acquiring](https://ibb.co/WVq4jGp) a credit card rewards business; thus, betting travel will come back in the next years. The company will acquire the technology platforms, travel agency, gift card and points businesses from cxLoyalty Group, which is a privately held company. This will be a hit to Expedia, as JP Morgan had been using the credit card rewards program from them, but now will return the use the cxLoyalty platform like they did until 2018, as cxLoyalty has over 3.000 clients and market partners like Citigroup, Capital One and Mastercard and serve more than 70M consumers.

Let‚Äôs hope for a good day in the market as both the [EU STOCKS](https://ibb.co/zFkGLYs) and the [US FUTURES](https://ibb.co/R2L0kRV) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, as growth companies are [outperforming](https://ibb.co/gMFNd50) the value plays in this final month of 2020. As we also saw yesterday Goldman‚Äôs chief economist lifting the [outlook](https://ibb.co/rv12bH5) for the Q1 US GDP by 2% and a full year growth increase of .50% to see a GDP growth of 5.8% in 2021, which should be another bullish sign for the stock market.

864,Things I wish people had told me when I started investing,1621390949.0,"I‚Äôve been doing really well and I feel like sharing my thoughts for anyone interested. These are the things I wish I had known which would have saved me a lot of setbacks.

Ignore the charts. Don‚Äôt even look at them when making a decision. Regardless of what anyone says. A chart will only tell you what has happened so far. It will never tell you what will happen next. There is one exception to this I have found but I will bring that up at the very end of this post.

Use critical thinking for any single piece of information you read about a company or the market. Who published it and why? I haven‚Äôt yet found (and probably never will find) a single news article or post with neutral information on a company. And it‚Äôs never going to happen. In the stock market there are many different players and they all have different motives. Don‚Äôt trust what a Reddit investor tells you. But also don‚Äôt trust what CNN or CNBC tell you. There is something called ‚Äúbias‚Äù and you have to be able to adjust the weight you give to any information you receive based on how biased the information is or might be. Any time you get information check multiple sources. Never rely on one single source. Or even one single type of source. If you only trust major news outlets you will be mislead or worse be behind the curve. If you only trust what investing forums say you are likely to run into people who are bagholding and trying to pump the stock to be able to dump it for a higher price before it keeps tanking. The truth is somewhere in the middle. Do your own research and don‚Äôt hesitate to use Google‚Äôs ‚Äúpast 24 hour‚Äù search filter to make sure you‚Äôre getting the latest information.

Stay open to criticism. If you have a good idea but someone knows better, it‚Äôs not just a learning experience but it can save you from losing your money. However, only take criticism seriously if someone can properly articulate their point and isn‚Äôt just spouting catchphrases or being an asshole.

Dollar cost averaging. It‚Äôs better to make several buys into a stock than one giant buy. It‚Äôs impossible to perfectly time the market. But you will almost always get a better entry point by averaging than by throwing down all the chips on the first move.

Always do your own due diligence. If you can‚Äôt write a thesis explaining why you‚Äôre making an investment (that‚Äôs not only convincing but free of confirmation bias) then you probably shouldn‚Äôt invest. Don‚Äôt just research the company, research the market the company is in. If the company is poised to do well and corner the market but there isn‚Äôt much of a market in general then there is no future for the company. In addition, research the ‚Äútarget audience‚Äù not for the company but for the shares themselves. What type of investors are buying shares? Are they the opportunistic kind? Are they buying just for a quick profit to scalp before they dump the stock into oblivion, or are they buying because they see a future for the company and plan a long term hold? This can be true of institutional investors as well as retail. It‚Äôs a better sign (for now anyway) when a happy whale like Cathie buys shares banking on the future of a company than if a super-predator like Chamath is buying them for a quick flip. Always keep other investors in mind when you make a decision. Investors are the consumer that drives the price of a share.

Buy the dip but only if you have a good reason to! Don‚Äôt blindly buy every dip. I see that pushed too often on Reddit. Buying a dip is good if a company is on an upwards trend and the dip occurred randomly. Do NOT buy the dip if it‚Äôs part of a larger downtrend or if it‚Äôs possibly due to an overall change in sentiment. Worst case scenario you will multiply your loss and best case scenario you will tie up further capital on a loser which results in decreased ammunition if you suddenly find a winner. Your $500 you could have used to buy a gainer will now be $300 you can use to buy another stock.

Don‚Äôt ever hesitate to cut your losses. If a company is in a downwards trend and it looks like they will be for a while (and there is no catalyst around the corner) cut the loss. Put your money in a better place. But keep watching the ticker. You can always buy back in when the sentiment turns positive. Keep a watchlist of stocks that look promising but don‚Äôt make it so big that you lose oversight and don‚Äôt make it so small that you‚Äôre missing too many opportunities.

Gauge your performance by your method and not by your gains and losses. If you‚Äôre up 100%, be honest with yourself. Are you up because you got lucky or because you have a solid strategy? If you‚Äôre down 40%, was it because of unpredictable factors or was it your own fault because you bought due to fear of missing out which clouded your thinking? Never beat yourself up. Learn from every move you make. Remember it‚Äôs impossible to perfectly time anything. If you sold and secured a 10% gain but it could have been 15%, that‚Äôs normal. You‚Äôre never going to catch the top of a spike or the bottom of a dip. That‚Äôs like waiting in the ocean for the perfect wave. It won‚Äôt happen and you‚Äôll drown unless you‚Äôve learned to surf when the wave gets to you. Same with buying. Most of the time when you buy, the stock will move down. I‚Äôve lost a small percentage at the start of almost all my well planned and well timed moves. I kept holding and the losses turned into significant gains.

Manage risk and reward. The higher the risk, the lower percentage of your profile you should put into it. Be psychologically prepared to lose everything. The more you‚Äôre willing to live with that possibility, the more you‚Äôre going to be able to keep a cool mind when taking a calculated risk.

Never stop learning. The more you know, the more of an edge you have. Get in the habit of reading several articles per day. Focus on your existing investments so you can learn how what type of news affects the markets in which ways.

Never stop looking for opportunities. They don‚Äôt come to you. You have to find them like a needle in a haystack or a diamond in the rough. You‚Äôll get much better at finding them with time. If you don‚Äôt get good at looking for opportunities and evaluating them then you won‚Äôt have any opportunities.

Never buy in to hype. The more hyped a stock is, the more likely it is that it will tank later. Even if you find a promising company for a good long term investment, wait until the hype dies down and the share price goes down. Otherwise you‚Äôll start your investment with a slow and steady loss.

Shares are priced based on supply and demand. There are bids and there are asks. The higher the demand is on shares the higher the bids will be. The lower the demand is on a share the lower the bids will be. What this means is that when there is more buying pressure than selling pressure the cost of a share goes up. When there is more selling pressure than buying pressure the cost of a share goes down. In fact, that is all a chart will really tell you. Think of a chart as a historical look at past buying and selling pressure. Nothing more and nothing less. The price direction is determined only by buying and selling pressure.

The value of a share is subjective. You can run any equation you want to but there is no equation which links any of the variables of a company to the price of a share. There are many different ways to ‚Äúvalue‚Äù stocks. DDM, DCF, price to earnings, price to book, enterprise value to EBIDTA, Technicals...and they all mean nothing. Why? Because the value of a share is what people are willing to pay for it. A stock is no different than a consumer good. Take, for example, iPhone. If you compare the iPhone 12 to android phones with similar specs the iPhone 12 price tag more than doubles some lesser known brands with the same specs. But people are willing to pay more for the iPhone. So the iPhone costs more. The value of a share is the same. If people are willing to pay more for a share of a company then those shares will cost more even if there is no mathematically verifiable reason.

There is no formula based on the specs of a phone which will predict what the retail cost of the device will be. Just like there is no formula which will take any company metrics into account and determine the price of a share.

Stocks go up and stocks go down. Everyone hates red days. But they‚Äôre normal and they‚Äôre not a sign you‚Äôre doing something wrong. They mostly move when there are catalysts that have either positive or negative effects on sentiment. The rest of the time they will trade sideways or slightly downwards. As long as the slope isn‚Äôt steep and there have been no bad news about the company having a red day is fine. In fact if a stock was only green all the time I would probably sell it because that could be a good sign it‚Äôs in a bubble and bubbles are known for bursting.

The biggest gains and losses in the market are driven by the biggest changes in investor sentiment. And investor sentiment isn‚Äôt rational. It‚Äôs irrational. For example there could be some slight bad news about a company which will have no bearing on the bottom line (for example a brief delay in a crucial step) which hits a nerve and causes an emotional overreaction which causes the stock to tank. Or there could be some neutral news about a company which investors mistakenly perceive as positive causing the stock to skyrocket.

Catalysts don‚Äôt matter. People‚Äôs reactions to the catalysts matter. If you look into a company that has upcoming catalysts, don‚Äôt focus on how the catalysts will effect the bottom line for the company. Focus on how the catalysts will impact investor sentiment. For example, if a company decides to increase the cost of a pharmaceutical product and they are now going to make 12 billion more dollars over the next 5 years, that‚Äôs great for the company. But if people are upset and there is bad publicity like ‚ÄúMy mother died because she couldn‚Äôt afford her diabetes medication after the price hike.‚Äù then the value of a share will go down.

The biggest gains are in speculative investing but they also carry the highest risk. The reason that speculation has the biggest potential for gains is strictly due to human psychology. Investors are going to be a lot more fearful to invest in a company which isn‚Äôt generating revenue or where the future of a company has no proven results to back it up. Even if that company is going to cure cancer. But that‚Äôs also why there is the potential for a huge reward. If you can find a company investors are fearful to invest in now and you have enough data about the company to conclude that they are going to be successful, then you can actually turn a speculation into a somewhat more secure investment. 

For example, if a company announces that they found a cure for alzheimer‚Äôs. And you just happen to be a neuroscientist. If you understand the science and you instantly realize that they have a disruptive breakthrough, you can now use that to your advantage. You can invest in the company now with the knowledge that the science is solid. This gives you an edge. You know that you know the company will be a success. But you also know that anyone who isn‚Äôt a neuroscientist will have little faith in the company. As a result, you have now found a company which is setup for a massive change in sentiment. So you buy 10,000 shares for $0.03. Eventually, the company moves through to phase 3 clinical trials and the product gets approved. The news headlines hit that a company cured alzheimers. Now the shares you bought for $0.03 are suddenly worth $15. Your degree in neuroscience just paid off better than your actual day job as a neuroscientist. As the stock keeps trending upwards the $300 you spent is now $150,000. This gain is mostly attributable to using your existing knowledge to get ahead of a pivot in investor sentiment.

Use what you know. Just like the example above. Everyone has areas they are more or less knowledgeable about. If you know a lot about technology, focus on technology stocks. If you are a geologist, focus on mining stocks. Anyone can have an advantage. Even if you‚Äôre working at a deadbeat job and you get a free sample for an air freshener that finally actually gets rid of the smell of stale cigarettes in your well used car, invest in that air freshener. Any single piece of knowledge you have about any single thing can be used to your advantage to make a trade.

Which company evaluations actually do matter? Is the company going to be able to survive? That‚Äôs the main thing I‚Äôve been looking at with my speculations. A company could have come out with a technological breakthrough. But do they have the funding or an existing revenue stream to carry it out? Are they going to be consumed by debt and implode or are they getting funding in one way or another? Another important one is if another company will buy them out. If a company has mediocre performance and is going to be bought out by Microsoft that can be great for your investment. But if a company has a breakthrough, doesn‚Äôt have the resources to commercialize it themselves and has to give in to the highest bidder for a buyout then the upside to your investment is going to be a lot more limited.

Those are really the only company metrics I‚Äôm focused on.

Stay up to date on your investments. Don‚Äôt just look at your portfolio once a month and complain about it going up or down. Is your chart going up? Find out why. Is your chart going down? Find out why.

Stay ahead of the news! If it‚Äôs 5am and you have to get up for work, get in the habit of quickly checking the news on your tickers so that you can stay on top of any changes. The sooner you know bad news came out the more likely it is you will be able to hit the sell button before anyone else does. If you have tickers you‚Äôre watching, try to buy in the moment there is good news or in advance of the good news. Especially if the sentiment is positive.

Be careful with stop losses. If you don‚Äôt know what a stop loss is, it basically means that you have set up your purchase so that your broker will sell your shares for you if they dip below a certain amount. They can be great for risk management but they can also screw you over. If you bought a company for $10 and you have a stop loss at $8 you won‚Äôt be happy when it dips to $7.50 before shooting up to $20. Because now your stop loss actually worked against you. You lost a +100% gain and you secured a loss. Another time stop losses can be unhelpful is if your stock is trading on a foreign exchange as well. For example, if you have a stock on the NASDAQ trading for $10 and a stop loss for $9 but it also trades on a European exchange. It the stock closes at $10 but tanks overnight and trading opens at $5 on the NASDAQ, your stop loss will have done nothing. Even worse, it‚Äôs possible your stop loss won‚Äôt be triggered at all now because the system won‚Äôt pull the trigger while the price of the shares continues to drop.

Market buys, market sells, limit buys and limit sells. I see a lot of confusion about this online and quite a few people get limit orders mixed up with the bid-ask spread. Small fish investors like retail have nothing to do with the bid-ask spread. When you place a market buy order through your broker you are agreeing to purchase a set number of shares at the current market price. I never use market orders. Why? Because if you execute a market buy or a market sell and the price of the security changes rapidly it won‚Äôt fill at all. And in order to cancel it and place a new order you first have to find it, then cancel it and then place a new order. I always use limit orders. If I‚Äôm buying shares and the cost looks like it‚Äôs on an upwards trend I will always place a limit buy for a price quite a bit higher than the current market value. Some people seem to think you won‚Äôt get the best price possible that way but this is wrong. If a stock is trading for $8 and you put in a limit buy for $8.50 but the stock only goes up to $8.10 your broker will fill it at $8.10. If I‚Äôm buying shares and the cost of the security looks like it‚Äôs currently on a downwards trend I will place a limit buy just a bit above what I think it will drop down to. That way I don‚Äôt have to stare at the chart all day and I can check throughout the day and place a new order if the direction changed and it didn‚Äôt fall below that point yet. As far as selling goes I will always place limit orders as well to guarantee the trade goes through instead of putting faith in a lack of volatility and risking the sell not going through. If the stock is going down I will place a limit sell for a lower price. If the stock is going up I will place a limit sell for a higher price. I won‚Äôt make them too much higher or too much lower though because this is the opposite of buying and I don‚Äôt want the stock to get stuck to my hands when I‚Äôm trying to dump it.

Since investor sentiment drives the price of shares, wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if there was a single quick way to gauge the current investor sentiment towards a company? As it turns out, you can! And you can do it really quickly by eyeballing a chart even if you don‚Äôt have a clue what you‚Äôre doing. Here‚Äôs how. Take a look at the chart. Focus on points in the chart where there have been sudden upwards and sudden downwards movements. And look at what happens following those movements.

If the stock dropped 12% due to some bad news, what happens next? Does it stay down or does it climb back up? The quicker it climbs back up out of a dip, the more positive investor sentiment is.

If the stock jumped up 12% due to some good news, what happens next? Does it stay up and slowly keep rising or does it tank back down to levels even lower than before the spike? The quicker it drops back down after a spike, the more negative investor sentiment is.

Keep in mind though that investor sentiment can change and just because there has been overall positive or negative sentiment in the past does not mean that the sentiment will continue. Check news for any updates on the company. Make sure nothing is in the works that could cause the sentiment to change to the negative when you are buying in. Check stock message boards. Check financial news. Use your brokers news feed, they are often quicker to the punch.

It‚Äôs definitely more profitable to buy something that has overall positive sentiment.

Edit: I will add, don‚Äôt ever be afraid to re-evaluate your strategy. If it isn‚Äôt working there‚Äôs a good chance it will keep not working. It‚Äôs better to try something new than to watch your portfolio slowly erode while you have plenty of time to research and make new moves.",2021-05-18 19:22:29

Stocks turned positive Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones shaking yesterday‚Äôs losses and the Nasdaq recording a new intraday recor. Market participants continue to weigh rising coronavirus cases in the United States and optimism surrounding a vaccine and additional fiscal stimulus. 

In Washington, lawmakers continue to negotiate in order to agree on measures to fund the government and provide another virus relief package. Lawmakers are poised to vote tomorrow Wednesday on a resolution to push back the deadline to fund the government from this Friday to next week in order to avoid a government shutdown, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. We‚Äôll closely monitor developments in this matter. 

In an effort to support the economy, a bipartisan group of Senators unveiled a new stimulus proposal worth $908 billion, a sum greater than the ceiling Senate Leader Mitch McConnel (Rep.) set but below the Democrat‚Äôs original $2 billion proposal. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Dem.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Dem.) have indicated they support the proposal and Senator Bill Cassidy (Rep.) told Fox News he is confident the President and Senator McConnell will support the bill. We‚Äôll have to wait and see how it plays out but we do not expect the passage of any stimulus at least until Biden‚Äôs administration takes over.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, says the full impact of Thanksgiving gatherings hasn‚Äôt been seen yet. He said, ‚ÄúThe blip from Thanksgiving isn't even here yet. So we‚Äôre getting those staggering numbers of new cases and hospitalizati0ns before we even feel the full brunt of the Thanksgiving holiday‚Äù. The US is averaging nearly 200,000 infections and 2,237 deaths in the last seven numbers, the deadliest week in the pandemic since late April, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are well over 100,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus. Yesterday, the US recorded around 202,000 new daily infections, 101,487 patients hospitalized, and 1,522 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins Univerisity.

Despite rising cases,  the market is reacting positively to the prospects for widespread vaccine distribution next year and the possibility of additional fiscal stimulus in the US. Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old woman from the United Kingdom, became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outside of the clinical trial. While expectations for growth in 2021 remain high, we expect volatility in the market in the short-term, given the surge in coronavirus cases and the reimposition of restrictions across the nation. California recently placed more than 85% of its residents under stay-at-home order after ICU capacity fell below 15%.

Looking ahead, market participants will continue to eagerly follow developments on the coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to convene its outside scientific advisory board on Thursday to discuss Pfizer‚Äôs (PFE) emergency use authorization request for its vaccine. The advisors could vote as soon as that day whether to recommend that the FDA green-light the inoculation and allow the first phase of roll-outs to states. Moderna (MRNA) has also filed an emergency use authorization with the FDA. The FDA is expected to make an announcement about Moderna‚Äôs vaccine sometime this week as well. 

**Highlights**

If you could travel back in time to the 19th century, it would be very difficult to convince anyone that railroad investments were not the future of the stock market.

Governments were offering subsidies and land grants to stimulate rapid industry growth ‚Äì and in the period of 1868-1873, just after the American Civil War, an astonishing 33,000 miles of new railroad track were laid.

Entrepreneurs and financiers started betting on ambitious enterprises like the Northern Pacific Railway ‚Äì and as the transportation boom raged on, more than 60% of total U.S. stock market capitalization came from railroad related stocks.

We know today that the railroad boom didn‚Äôt live up to the expectations drawn out by speculators.

The valuations of all of those rail companies seem pretty absurd in hindsight, especially when looking at this week‚Äôs Chart of the Week on U.S. stock market history. It pulls numbers from Global Financial Data to contrast the relative sector weightings over 200 years.

While there are some obvious historical moments to be discovered on the chart, perhaps the most important lesson it demonstrates is the unpredictability of the market in general.

This is a reminder of why stock markets provide both risk and reward ‚Äì as the speculators from 1869 found out, nobody knows for sure what the future holds.

How do you think the stock market sector weightings will look in the future?

What a lot of people probably don't realize is that hedge fund activity is probably *more* predictive of future returns than insider activity. The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money. In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

I'll post this report once again to see if anybody finds it interesting.

Google (GOOG) has agreed to acquire wearable technology company, Fitbit, in a deal worth approximately $2.1 billion. The purchase of Fitbit (FIT) gives Google some real firepower in the fight to take-on industry leaders like Apple (AAPL), which has dominated the wearable space ever since the release of its Apple Watch in 2015.

‚ÄúIt's less of a hardware play on the trackers and on the smartwatches but really a data play... Google will now have information on not only the temperature of my house, to the extent I've got four Nest thermostats or whether or not I have a smoke alarm going off or things like that, they'll know, in fact, how much I move on a given day, how many steps I take, things of that nature,‚Äù D.A.

874,How to Trade IPO Debuts for Quick Profits,1597185893.0,"(posted this in /r/stocks but the mods gave me a hard time, and people seemed to appreciate it, so I'm posting here)

The main reason I'm writing this, is because during last week's BigCommerce IPO, there were a lot of question on how to play the IPO once the stock hit the market, ranging from ""When does the stock start trading"", to ""How much will it cost when it debuts"", to ""Why is the debut price so much higher than the stated IPO price?""...

I made $20k on a $35 investment on BigCommerce (Turned $35k into $55k), and have now played 7 IPOs without a loss, but this was the first one I really nailed. I'm gonna go in depth on what I've learned over the past 4 years trading IPOs, and share with you a strategy that I really nailed down in the past few months.

I'm specifically talking about buying an stock on the day of the IPO once the stock starts trading. For most of us who do not have substantial capital in our accounts, or whose brokers don't get access to many IPOs at the listing price, the best we can do is buy the stock once it is actively trading on the open market (the 'debut').

While it sounds pretty straight forward, buying a stock on the day of its IPO is rather tricky, since you don't know exactly when it will start trading, or at what price it will actually debut on the open market, and since the price often moves very quickly once it starts trading, you want to be able to buy in as soon as possible, especially for a super hot IPO - and there IS a way to get stock the minute it debuts on the market.

To give you an idea of what you can accomplish - in the LMND, NCNO, and BIGC IPOs, you could relatively easily made about 50% on your money on each of these within a day of the IPO.

IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND - not every IPO is going to soar, you need to be selective, you need to take precautions to limit your downside, and the goal here is to make the right moves on a stock that DOES take off once it debuts off it's IPO while not losing money, or at least limiting your losses, when the IPO is a dud.

First, some quick background info to get everyone up to speed, since it does help to prepare you for playing the IPO the day a stock debuts trading:

An IPO (Initial Public Offering) is the process by which a private company, often a startup, initially lists their company's shares for sale on the public markets. The purpose of this is typically for a company to raise money - they sell shares to the public and use the proceeds from those sold shares to grow their business. Another reason a company will 'go public' is so that employees, investors, and owners of the company can realize a capital gain (make money) from the stock they own/have earned as they founded and grew out the company.

Traditionally, a company will hire established Investment Banks to promote their IPO to institutional investors (pension funds, hedge funds, etc), in order to build out a substantial base of buyers who will purchase the shares offered in the IPO. In the weeks leading up to the IPO, the company's executive team will meet with these investors and pitch their business in order to drum up support for the IPO, and these large investors will 'subscribe' to buy a certain number of shares within an expected price range, which is ultimately determined usually the day of the IPO.

The day of the IPO.So going into the day of a major IPO, you know the range of the IPO price and you know the company will list that day, but you don't know what the debut price will be or when the stock will start trading, and this is your biggest initial challenge.

I'm already assuming the stocks I want to use this strategy for are creating a pretty big buzz in the media and social networks, so my expectation is that they will pop once they start trading. This means that within a few minutes of trading, the stock will already likely have shot up a few dollars or more, so you really want to get in right away.

KEY ENTRY STRATEGY: Set a LIMIT ORDER for a couple of dollars above the Ask Price of the stock, so you are ensured to get shares right when the stock debuts.

You will need to keep an eye on the movement of the Ask price every 5 minutes or so until you see the price start to stabilize - since you don't know exactly when the stock will start trading, you're going to need to babysit this for as long as a couple hours: adjusting your Limit Order price according to the Ask price (there are apps that can show you this key info in real time).

For example, the BIGC IPO price was $24, but the debut price started at $70 and then came down to $55 and bounced around a bit. So when the Ask price shows $55, you set your Limit Order for $57; when it goes up to $60, you adjust your Limit Order to $63. If you're like me, you're throwing all your available funds at this thing, so you need to adjust the amount of shares you want to purchase in relation to the price change.

You really have to stay on top of this, because the price can swing pretty fast, and you want to optimize the number of shares you get.

For those who don't understand Limit Orders: a Limit Order (BUY) is basically saying that you agree to pay UP TO $X.XX for the stock.

At some point, the stock will just start trading. There is no real warning, although you can sort of get a feel for it when the swings in price start getting incrementally smaller.

IF you kept your limit price above the Ask price, you SHOULD get bought in almost exactly at the debut price once the stock starts trading. If you managed to do this properly - great, for the type of IPO we're looking for, you got in at the lowest point possible.

So that covers the first part - getting INTO your trade at the optimal price - for home run IPO debuts, the price typically goes straight up.

\+++

Okay, now I'm gonna stop for a minute and talk minimizing your loss potential for when a stock does NOT go right up off the debut. Not every IPO is gonna explode, and in order to be in position to capitalize on the ones that DO explode, you're probably gonna have to play a bunch of them that are duds or just don't rocket right off the launch ramp.

For every LMND and NCNO there's a RLAY, QH, BLCT, and BLI. Granted, some of these turned out to be potential wins (BLI and RLAY), but not at the level of LMND/NCNO/BIGC - and a couple of them fell pretty significantly right after they IPOd. Even just last week, RXT did a nosedive which would have garnered a 20% loss or worse.

The good news is, that almost all of these stocks experienced a slight bump in the first few minutes after they debuted. If I'm not incredibly confident in a stock, I'm gonna set a Stop Loss either right at my entry point or slightly below it. If it get's triggered, oh well, either no loss or a small loss, and I just accept that even if the stock recovers, at least I haven't lost money. The real winners with huge gains are usually obvious from the start.

I'm gonna say this again just to make my point. Set your Stop Loss for whatever amount you feel comfortable losing, and do it right away. It's okay to lose a little. The home run plays don't do a big dip right out the gate - they run off pretty much straight from the starting line. You really don't want to be sweating it out while a stock dittles around the debut price for the day.

One mistake I made with the LMND and NCNO IPOs was raising my Stop Loss amount as the stock popped. Had I simply left my Stop Loss at my entry point, it would not have been triggered at all, but raising it incrementally as the stock price shot up caused it to get triggered on a down swing before the stocks ultimately went far beyond the initial spike.

The anatomy of the stock charts for the home run plays look very similar, particularly in the first 30 minutes of trading. A big jump off the debut price, with an initial spike. BIGC triggered two circuit breakers on the way from $68 to $93 before coming back down to the low $70s before climbing up to $103 the next day. LMND and NCNO followed similar paths. You might consider just selling out a portion or all of your stock on the initial spike, but for the real home run plays, you'll be leaving money on the table if you sell of the initial spike.

HAVING A GAME PLAN

Just as it's a good idea to set your Stop Limit to control your acceptable loss, it helps to define your expectations for what you envision as a 'win'. It's not easy to time these things to perfection, so if you have some idea as to how much you would be happy to walk away with, you can exit your position if/when your target is reached, and be happy regardless of what the share price does from there.

For BIGC, $100 was my target, and I got out at $100.25. Once it went over $100 I set my stop at $100, and brought it up to $100.50 when it went to $101.00 - I got stopped out as it dropped back down from there.

To clarify that strategy: once your target price is met, instead of just selling at Market Price, set a Limit Order and see if it runs a little, while raising your limit behind the price until you get stopped out. You can also sell out in phases to average out your exit point. While I don't normally do this, it is a sensible approach.

I find that these stocks typically make a run at the end of the IPO day, and often push higher the next day. While there is no way to predict this for certain, remember that you're looking for the home run IPOs, and will inevitably play some dud IPOs along the way. The point is to NOT LOSE MONEY on the duds, while maximizing the value of the home runs.

Knowing how to read candle style charts might help you define your exit point as well, but is by no means necessary.

And another note: when you really nail it, you might consider holding onto a few shares of the stock - basically free stock - if you really believe in the company. For example, I bought in for 520 shares of BIGC @$68 and sold 470 shares @$100.25 (+$15,157.50), and kept 50 shares (@$100/share this would be $5,000).

Edit: Since first writing this piece, BIGC has come down considerably, so the shares I held onto are worth a bit less: but they were essentially paid for out of the winnings and I expect this company to be valuable long term.Playing RKT the following day would have netted a pretty big win as well, but I was too amped to focus... something for me to work on as well.

I'll be trying the same approach with BEKE, XPEV, and CVAC this week, with high hopes for DCT...

Feel free to ask me any questions, play along, or give me further pointers on how I can refine my strategy.

Best of luck!",2020-08-11 15:44:53

Forbes made this analysis and I have been calling this for a while. Now I will agree that I underestimated the feds buying potential. It did really prop up the market but sentiment has been pessimistic the last week. 

I believe we are, or almost are at the tipping point. 

We could easily see a crash by next Monday.

878,"To all the new arrivals here, welcome to r/stockmarket!",1511242744.0,"Hello there investors and traders!

Welcome to r/stockmarket!

We have had a big influx of new arrivals in the sub over the past few weeks, so I thought it would be good to have a little refresher on the direction and goals of this most glorious of subreddits!

Our goal is to provide information, breaking and interesting news and ideas. Short term, mid term, long term, what ever tickles your fancy!

There are always going to be new investors and traders arriving, so one important request is that you be patient and lend a helping hand when ever possible!

History:

I used to be an extremely active daytrader, when I discovered reddit, r/investing was the sub I went to immediately. I posted a lot of daytrading and short term content, like technical analysis, which was not very popular.

In order to silence my heresy, the old mods of r/investing made me a mod there, thus making me have to respect their rules and stop posting my silly daytrading ideas.

I started posting more of the short term ideas here in this sub, and the long term stuff in r/investing.

I am not a very active trader anymore, I have shifted into more long term strategy, but I do see r/stockmarket continue to be a place where a lot good information continues to be exchanged!

You all see u/bigbear0083 post a lot of material every week, he has been doing an amazing job at keeping great content on the front page, thank you from all of us! He also provides content on stock market forums at https://stockaholics.net . 

I speak to him and u/WittilyFun fairly often. WittilyFun runs the financial site https://www.tiingo.com/ which has some amazing free services. The mods here may not post as much as the most active members, but they are always busy behind the scenes! Thank you for the hard work mods! We all appreciate it!

The mods and I ask you all to help monitor the quality of the posts being made, and help direct new arrivals in the right direction.

On the topic of new arrivals, I really want to see the community here reach out and help the countless newbies that arrive here every day.

I know some of the questions sounds stupid to many of you, but remember, we were all new at some point! 

It can get repetitive, but if you see a newbie question, instead of downvoting it away, please try give them a useful answer. Many of the new arrivals are scared to ask questions that they have not been able to find suitable answers for on their own. Your help can make a big difference in getting a new investor or trader on the right path! Give them 10sec of your time to get them going in the right direction, those 10sec you spared can lead to years of profitable involvement in the markets!

Spam and lazy posts:

As we grow, we are all seeing more spammy and lazy posts here.

Spam is obvious most of the time, if you see a post with a link leading to some suspicious blog, its most likely spam. Simply report it as such and a mod will come along to take care of it.

Lazy posts are on the rise!

A lazy post is either just a link to an external site with no comment, or a self post with nothing but a title and then a link to some other site, with no other commentary or content. If you are taking the time to post something here that others will find interesting, please be sure to explain why in the post before tossing in the link to an external site!

I have seen a few people post to their own youtube channels, personally I do not mind as long as the topic of the video is relevant. I for one will happily support individuals who are creating worthy content, as long as no subscription or fee is required to access that content. 

Again, a warm welcome to all the new arrivals!

Compared with last year‚Äôs iPhone 11 line of phones, the iPhone 12 line is showing strong demand in China. The country is estimated to account for 35 to 45 per cent of global demand for the iPhone 12 Pro, according to a recent report from TF Securities International analyst Kuo Ming-Chi, who is known for his Apple analysis. There were between 7 million and 9 million pre-orders of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro globally during the first weekend of sales, according to Kuo.

The new iPhones have also proven to be a hot commodity on Chinese e-commerce sites. The available stock on JD.com sold out within 30 seconds after pre-orders started on October 16. And Alibaba, the parent company of the South China Morning Post, said that about 30 million users have searched for the new iPhones over the last 30 days on its Tmall marketplace. That is twice the search volume for the iPhone 11 in the same period last year.

Sales of the iPhone 12 could be aided by the fact that it is the first iPhone to support 5G after Apple skipped the feature last year. Sales of the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro reached an estimated 1.7 to 2 million units globally in the first 24 hours of pre-orders. The three iPhone 11 models only saw 500,000 to 800,000 units sold in the same period after pre-orders opened in September last year, according to the report from Kuo.

iphone demand in China is still strong, initial preorder data indicate that Apple will be gaining back more share in China. People are spending money in China to buy iphone because China is more 5g coverage available. These are bullish trend for apple stock.

886,"Easily track the prevailing sentiment of over 3000 securities using machine-learning ... 30k articles, 500k social media posts analyzed per week",1522969193.0,"*A few things to note:  
1. This is a free service!   
2. Some of you may remember this site from a previous post of mine.  I got a lot of great feedback that helped shape tons of dev work since then, and am looking for more feedback now.  
3. I just finished out the spam report system as well, which will be greatly useful in protecting the integrity of the data as the system moves forward.  Essentially, as users interact with the system and report irrelevant data, the system will learn and get better at determining what it worth taking into account for each security.  My hope is that some beta users can help me make the system smarter.*  
  
Website: **[Quikfo.com](https://quikfo.com/)**  
Here's a poster for my thesis on this subject which sort of fuels a lot of the backend:  
https://i.imgur.com/RVZxDTP.png  
  
Basically, I made a system which tracks article headlines & social media posts for the Russell 3000 and some top market-cap cryptos, then keeps track of word association vs next-day performance, and finally uses Bayesian classification to come up with a score for each asset or security, based upon its current headlines, which indicates the likelihood that the price will rise or fall over the next day.  
  
You can also follow the system on Twitter @myQuikfo, it posts long and short picks every morning at ~8:30am. Please keep in mind this whole thing is in beta though, so when an aspect of my system crashes shit can hit the fan and the twitter may post nonsense.  
  
The radius of the bubble is the frequency of occurrence of a word, the hue of the bubble is the positive or negative severity (green being good, red being bad).  
  
The system works quite well so far. Looking back on the SP500, for example, the optimal trading strategy has been to buy at market open and sell at market close anything which is scored >=85. This strategy would have returned ~13.3% trading from 12/1/17 to 2/28/18.  
  
I'll be building out a full API for developers who want to use this data themselves. An early version is available on the site now with some brief documentation.  Please feel free to make use of it and let me know what more you would like to see added to it!    
  
And yes, I'm aware that some of the positive/negative word associations seem crazy. How can a good word be bad or a bad word be good, one might ask. Well all this does is indicate that when a word appears, it more often than not leads to a specific market movement. One could notice that 'Fraud' is particularly green...perhaps this is because when everyone is talking about fraud, then it's already priced in and may have found a bottom. The question of why can't really be answered by the system, that's more up to the inferences of the user.  
  
Looking for feedback from the community, please let me know what you think. There is tons of data being collected that I haven't even gotten around to building a front-end interface for. The possibilities are endless and I would love to tailor the project based upon the direction that this, and other communities, would like to see.
