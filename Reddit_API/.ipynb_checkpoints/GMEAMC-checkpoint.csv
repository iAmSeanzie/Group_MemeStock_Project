 Events of March 19 (IMO)  
I am close to 60 years of age, hold degrees in economics, finance and accounting, so numbers are what they are to me. I have been trading and investing over 20 years on a daily basis and have a pretty solid bank of experience with regard to the stock market, So what happened on Friday March 19?  


A couple of obvious points, early on there was a coordinate effort to drop the stock price toward $13 a share. That failed because of the amount of buying pressure that was put on the dive down in price. By 10 am it was apparent that the stock was not dropping below $13.50 a share and the line was drawn at $14.00 by what appears to have been a massive coordinated effort by several investment firms. As an avid watcher of levels 2 and 3 with regard to the stocks I have an interest in, this is the first and only time I can recall seeing 8-10 market makers all in unison controlling the ask price of a ticker. Like a professional dance company all of them moved in unison on the ask. Up a penny, down a half penny, etc etc and all within milliseconds of each other. This dance continued for hours on end, never allowing the price to run up.  
At close, these market makers all hit the bid with over 40 million shares. My question, where did all those shares come from and where did they go on the bid.  


We will never be able to prove any illegal activity regardless of what happened at the end of the day yesterday. The SEC sure as hell isn't going to look into anything. Remember, it is the hedge funds that are accusing us of manipulating the stock price, which is not true at all because we all love the stock, and I love the company. Been going to the theaters since they used 16mm reels and Dolby systems did not exist.  


OK. So what is the read into everything Well. first and foremost, it was an act of desperation by the hedge funds. They pretty much announced to the world that they know they are screwed on this one and no longer care what tactics they use in their efforts to minimize their upcoming losses. Second, as all of those shares were being sold between 13.90 and 14.02 how many are now in the hands of apes? Of those how many are real shares and how many naked shares will they need to add to the piles of failure to deliver shares, naked shares and the over 187000 call options that expired ITM yesterday? In a nut shell, I think they dug a deeper hole than even they can climb out of.  


Now more than ever here I am determined to keep buying and will not sell 1 share until these hedge funds start to cover all of their misdeeds. It's coming, they are going to delay it as long as possible trying to spread fear of a massive drop in price, trying to get current investors to become impatient and sell. Trying to divide the shareholders into groupings that they will intend to attack separately. They will attack the first group, those who think they will sell at $30 a share, then they will go after the next group of those who think $50 a share is enough and so on. Remember its easier for them to attack smaller groups than the entire group of apes. IT IS KEY THAT WE STICK TOGETHER.  


The price of our stock is up again this week and although we did not end above $14 a share the week was a win for us again. For the past month we have been winning the battles and eventually we will win the war and the price of this stock will soar.  


Patience is needed now more than ever. This will not be the last effort of our common enemy. They will continue to pull every stunt they think they can, and we simply need to not sell any of our shares. For us the battle is getting easier. for them it gets more complex with every stunt they pull and fail at. Make no mistake in reading into this past weeks action, WE WON, THEY LOST. There are hundreds of millions of shares that will need to be purchased to cover short positions which are not just under $14. They still have FTD contracts that go back to when this was under $8. In other words they are still way behind on their obligations. We aren't.  


Going to be another good week ahead if we all hold these shares and those who can, me included, continue to buy and hold more shares. Be smart with what you spend here. But be assured that this company is not a $14 a share company even without the squeeze. With operations back at AMC as a minimum this ticker will trade in the $20 range so the future still shows upward movement even without what we all know is coming in the near future.  


Sorry about being long winded, I just thought it needed to be out that we are still winning this war and we will resume the fight on Monday the 22nd.  


Have a great weekend.",2021-03-20 19:20:39

Clearing Up Mis-Information On The Dark Pools Information Going Around - And What To Do Next,1616704684.0,"Like many of you I am holding both stocks. And will continue to hold no matter what. It's important that we all work with accurate information. In regards to the news about the dark pools I have found some counter information that was brought to my attention by the great work of u/rensole

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcuzj1/synopsis\_for\_03252021\_what\_we\_need\_to\_know\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mcuzj1/synopsis_for_03252021_what_we_need_to_know_before/)

This is important as it has what has given us all not only an insight into what is going on. But maybe a look at how much steam the hedge funds have left in this fight. And that is something they do not want us to know.

I think Alex has been more than fair to us. She is an expert and I think she can be taken seriously.She says that this dark pool looks ""normal"";

Her exact words are;

>""Most retail orders are being executed off-exchange by ""internalizers"" like Citadel due..""

And it cuts off there...

What she is saying is that this total number could also include the buying and selling of **our** trades. So if an ape buys AMC through RH they will get the stock from Citadel and places like these..

This is likely the explanation that will be given for these numbers.BUT when she writes ""AFAIK"" she is basically giving us a clue.. A breadcrumb..

**WE ARE ONTO SOMETHING!!!**

Andrew at MoMoney was right! We have found the Death Star!And there are two of them!

One for GME and another for AMC

Because even with what she has said the numbers **STILL** do not add up!They would only make sense if retail was buying and selling the total number of stocks 4x in that period!

All the evidence I have seen is that apes are holding.Not selling out and buying back in at a higher price!

**WE HAVE FOUND THE NAKED SHORTS!**

**WE NEED TO FIND AWAY TO SEPARATE THEM FROM THIS NUMBER!**

**SUGGESTED ACTIONS**

\*Apes need to find out the retail brokers who trade through Citadel and ask them what the fuck is going on! How many of these trades were theirs. Whatever is left will be the actual number of naked shorts.

\*Identify big spikes that took place when the SSR rule was in place (Illegal shorting). Find those brokers and report their crimes.. Light them up on social media and to lawmakers.

\*Someone needs clarification from Alex if naked shorts could be hidden in this number. She says she does not know but I do not think we have been seeing these kind of numbers from retail buyers. I think if it were just our buys that would make our buys more than most of the hedge funds combined!

\*Try and find from the largest retail brokers who traded with Citadel in this time. As a customer you have a right to know considering the amount of naked shorting that has been uncovered and legitimate concern's that apes are holding these IOU's

If enough of apes do this with all the biggest retail brokers then it wont take very long to get a pretty good estimate of how many naked shorts they are using.

And with that we can work out how many they have left!

**WHICH STILL MEANS WE ARE HEADING TOWARDS OUR OTHER GOAL OF OWNING 99% OF STOCK!**

\*Let apes know! The actions we have been seeing the hedge funds take against out DD creators and groups tells us we have hit a nerve. We need to open this wound!

***This can only get better, but we need to aim our shots right!***

**TL:DR;**

For AMC Folks - Just Remember This One Thing,1616234456.0," We, the retail investor own 80% of this stock. Think about that. UNDERSTAND THAT! The HF's are so highly shorted on this stock they absolutely MUST buy to cover at some point. And they have no choice to do that except through US. Thus far they have been content playing their various games, swapping spit, and playing catch with the shares they have and borrow. BUT WE OWN THE SHARES! The shares they MUST buy from us at SOME point to cover their losses. This isn't rocket science guys. We OWN THIS WAR. So do not even remotely worry yourselves over days that ""seem"" to be down days. They are not. What is coming is absolutely inevitable. Math doesn't lie. If you are new to all this and freakin' out trying to figure out exactly what is going on... DON'T. We have these assholes exactly where we want them. And they are digging themselves into an ever increasingly deep hole. THAT IS GOOD FOR US!!! There is only one way this can possibly end if we just HOLD! And they know it. Why do you think they spend so much time attacking us if we didn't matter????? We have already won this war. THEY know it. They just hope YOU don't. JMHO",2021-03-20 03:00:56

Disappointed with the division,1622792856.0,"Just got done watching the AA interview with Trey, and I just want to say I’m super disappointed in the division I’m seeing within the community. I really hope there were a lot of bots in the chat, because it was ugly in there. I can’t understand how so many people can invest in a company and be so hateful toward the CEO (and Trey for that matter) because one person says they should. 

The last interview with AA was so positive and uplifting, but this time the whole vibe was different. Everyone in the chat just wanted to prove that someone else was right and smarter than AA and Trey. 

We’re all on the same team and invested in the same company. I know this stopped being about fundamentals a long time ago, but the stronger a company is, the worse a short bet becomes. 

Everyone was screaming about dilution, but every last share sold since the last interview was out of the same pot that the 43M we already knew about came from. They have 46K left from that, and 46K could be eaten up in a couple seconds. 

Everyone screaming to vote no on the 25M share authorization for 2022 when that’s only 5% of what was being asked for on the original ballot. Talking about a share split to help shorts when 1.  That wouldn’t help the shorts at all, no extra un-owned shares would exist just more shares in the accounts of existing shareholders, 2. Can’t be done without a shareholder vote, and 3. Wouldn’t make any kind of sense to do since it would hurt the company post squeeze. 

Sorry for the rant and not posting on r/amcstock (typically a lurker without sufficient karma to post there now). Just needed to get that out. 

One final message: APE TOGETHER STRONG! APE DIVIDED WEAK AND HURT SQUEEZE!

Edit: Thanks for awards and positivity! We’re all in this together and I can’t stand seeing division. Whatever you’re hodling AMC/GME/BB/NOK/EXPR/KOSS/BBBY/anything else I missed, we took Occupy Wall St. to Wall St.’s home turf. And we’re not leaving!",2021-06-04 00:47:36

To those thinking this is the beginning of the AMC squeeze...,1620945482.0,"...no, it is probably not.

This is likely a reaction to a certain liquidity test where a certain firm had to get a certain loan for 1 day (is this oblique enough?).  The loan indicated that there was not enough capital on hand to cover certain stresses in the market.  The surge in volume is anticipatory of the squeeze, not the squeeze itself.

This will likely fall back a bit as volume decreases between 12 and 3 (as it always does) and people should not get depressed about that.  Think of this as a dry run...a surge of adrenalin...a confirmation we are on the right track.  Just don't submit your lambo orders JUST yet!!",2021-05-13 15:38:02

We KNEW this was going to happen...and we know what to do!,1622757239.0,"I posted this yesterday:

 

AMC just had a 100% gain, give or take AH. HFs continue to short. No squeeze yet.

What is the next move for HFs?

If I were a HF in this position, patience is no longer on my side,, and neither is time. I would consider a FOMO bagholder attack tomorrow.

What is this? It would be a massive ladder/sell attack to drive the price down...for the sole purpose of making retail paperhands afraid to be the bagholders. Start the snowball rolling down the hill and see if it starts an avalanche.

I know we in here are not selling...we have been around this block before. That does not mean they won't try and that doesn't mean they won't catch some who a) aren't here or b) have stop losses set. I am not saying this WILL happen, but if I were a HF it would be something I would do.

SO WHAT DO WE DO?

1. Make sure your stop loss is off (unless you REALLY want it on...this is not investment advice afterall!).
2. Be ready to buy the discounted tendies.

GME hate on AMC is out of hand,1620126840.0,"I know this community is small but I figure that many of the people here joined to get away from all the GME vs AMC FUD that seems rampant on the GME subs.

I was originally an AMC only ape. I got into this back on February 1st with 17 shares in AMC, my first investment ever. I picked AMC over GME because that was right after the original squeezes for both and I had falsely believed that the GME squeeze had played out and that AMC was the next big thing. I also did not have the kind of risk tolerance necessary to invest the large funds that GameStop required for someone with the amount of money that I have.

Overtime, I increased my position in AMC as I became more confident in the short squeeze and began to perceive an investment in AMC as less risky than I originally had. With that change, I started to realize that I wanted to buy into GME as well. I eventually did, and have been increasing my position in GME whenever I can.

I share all this because the GME subreddits tend to overlook that a lot of the people invested in AMC are retail investors who have never invested before and have even less money to their name than the average person invested in GME. GME apes will argue that GME has better fundamentals and perhaps that is true, but when GME is trading well above where it has ever traded before (excluding the original mini squeeze) the price of the stock looks inflated and that scares smaller investors away. AMC is trading below where it has traded historically, and that gives a lot of retail investors a considerable amount of confidence, something that is necessary for those with less money to play with.

I want to be clear. I believe GME is going to skyrocket right past the moon and land on Mars. I am team GME just like I’m team AMC. But please for the love of god just stop hating on retail investors who have nothing to their name and have been preyed upon by the 1% for generations. This division is absurd. We are all on the same boat.",2021-05-04 04:14:00

4/20 The beginning of the MOASS,1618011429.0,"I think GME and RC just laid down one hell of a fuck you hedgies move and here is why. 

AMC is going through a share recount right now. From what my ape brain understands 4/20 is the day when all synthetic shares are supposed to be purchased. I personally don’t believe they will be fully purchased by then which will start to put more and more pressure on the hedgies. 
So basically 4/20 AMC starts to really amplify fuck you hedgie pressure. 

Now with the announcement from GME yesterday that hedgies gotta fix their shit on what date..... o yea fucking 4/20. Do you think this was by accident? Do you think it was just a meme gesture?? Hell no this was a power play by RC and GME. They 100% know what’s going on with AMC, they 100% know shits going to get crazy on 4/20. 

Don’t put a date on it.... I’m not putting a freaking date on it. 
Will hedgies pay up on 4/20 absolutely not. They are going to hope apes put all their eggs in the 4/20 basket and when it doesn’t moon on 4/20 that apes get sad and sell. What happens if they don’t cover by 4/20. My understanding is the short interest will really start to skyrocket after 4/20 making it harder and harder for shitadel and friends to pay for everything. 

Let’s backup a little now. AMC basically said I’m going to bend you over on 4/20 and each day I’ll go harder and harder on your hedgie ass. GME said fuck that let’s double team this and really start pounding shitadel and friends on 4/20 and each day GME and AMC go harder and harder. 

Now this is all from an ape brain that is maybe half as big as rensole or treys on a day when they are wasted so I’ll take any advice or corrections on my post with all happiness. 

TL: DR:
4/20 AMC and GME start pounding shitadel and friends (without any lube).  If you want anymore info than that go read the damn thing it’s not that long.",2021-04-09 16:37:09

New people here with much appreciated stimmy reinforcements may not be prepared, I know I wasn't when I got in in Febuary on AMC at @16 bucks.

Here are a few things I personally am mentally prepared for, some of which we have already seen.

- shills

- divide and conquer among GME and AMC.

- negative media coverage.

- baiting financial advice.

- reddit having technical difficulties.

- your favorite source of info on youtube having    technical difficulties or pulling a Brucie.

"For all the most outstanding DD, thank you! Unbelievable regarding the amount of work and expertise you provide. A proposal to reach the widest audience:",1616883847.0,"  

First, thank you all for the most excellent and outstanding DD that you provide. I’m confident that it helps all the apes like me. This information must reach the greatest number of apes, and future apes, by communicating the takeaway, why this information is important, valuable, right up front. I’m confident most apes, like myself, consume the DD voraciously, but want to ensure that they don’t miss any detail of the importance, the “so what?” of the information provided. The motive for this proposal is not laziness, nor is it to be critical. I want to ensure that this great information reaches the widest audience; that in all the great detail, the message doesn’t get “lost in the sauce.” If some in the ape audience reads the information, but are not 100% sure of what each major takeaway is, why this is important, then the information may not truly reach each ape and is missing the widest audience. With that I propose that DD start with a “Bottom Line Upfront, or Takeaway Summary,” whatever you want to call it, as the first paragraph, in the DD communication. For example: 

Bottom Line, Upfront (BLUF):

1. This DD gives me confidence to hold GME and AMC because the short float percentage is truly much higher than being reported….provide a bullet, i.e.…it must exceed 80% etc.…

2. This DD shows the true value of the stock that the Hedge Funds don’t want you to understand….bullet on what that is….

3. This DD shows a catalyst that people may not have thought about….bullet on what that is..

4. This DD communicates that the sideways pattern of the GME and AMC chart which is a favorable technical pattern of consolidation and the beginning of an uptrend higher in stock price….

5. As few, or many, summary bullets as you want to ensure your important message is loud and clear…you get my point. I recommend that you provide the takeaways you want to communicate right at the top of the communication to reach the widest audience and sink this information into our minds and hearts. We don’t want to miss it! Again, thank you for the hard work, outstanding value, and confidence that you bring to our community!",2021-03-27 15:24:07

We. Are. NOT. Going. Away.,1621202755.0,"**TL; DR: This is the fight of my life. I am humbled by the scope and strength of resolve in this community. I will not stop until equity, opportunity, and basic human empathy is restored in this world. I’d rather fail than quit. After a lifetime of service and truly believing that my morals, my unwavering faith in kindness, honesty, and integrity were enough, I see that I was wrong. And I can’t unsee it. This is not nor has it ever been a game or a joke as the media might have people believe. The ONLY weapon on earth that has ever mattered is money. Apes. Together. Strong. To the moon, everyone. Oh, and this is not financial advice nor am I a financial advisor of any kind.**

I came into this experience out of morbid curiosity right after Gamestop had that first major increase in price. And then, during the Superbowl, a two second message flashed across my screen, and my interest was piqued. After that, I began to read. I poked around and lurked on message boards, reading everything I could get my hands on. Practically living off of DD and fact checking. Soon, I was convinced that this crazy ape community was way bigger than me, way bigger than my city, my town, and my country. Way bigger than everything, really. And while I have devoted my tiny, insignificant life to helping others, I never in a million years could have imagined where I have found myself today. My early investment was small, but the more I read, the more I realized what was at stake. And while initially, I just wanted to make enough money to help my kids start their lives debt free and maybe have a small nest egg to cushion the blow of reality, that has changed in the last six months. I have changed. And I believe there are many others out there who feel the same.

I want my children to grow up in a world where they can have some faith in the system. Where they can believe that opportunity is real, not just a dream or something for the exceptions or the elite. I want the people on this earth to have a fair shot and get a fair shake, and that has never, in the entire history of humankind, been the case. For centuries, little people like me have unsuccessfully combatted a system of corruption, nepotism, corporate backscratching, and insurmountable greed. We’ve waged a moral and ethical war against people who laughed in our faces. But now, I believe we have finally managed to find each other via these crazy online communities. And I truly feel as if we have a chance at undoing, or at least preventing, the nightmare of privileged entitlement that has loomed over our heads since the day we were all born. I believe in what I am doing. And I believe in more than money.

To all the sickeningly wealthy people who shrug and say, “Not me, I donate to charity” I am here to tell you it IS you. Your incomprehensible ability to look away and tell yourself that billions of people can just bootstrap themselves into fiscal responsibility and opportunity is an offense against every human being who has ever struggled, fought and failed to succeed in spite of their hard work, their belief in a dream, or their tireless hours spent working in low paying, soul crushing jobs just to achieve a passable income. You don’t know them. You don’t know me. And because of these lives we’ve been forced to lead while you make your millions or billions in profits off of our blood, sweat and tears LITERALLY speaking, we have finally grown weary of your games, your lies, your politics, and your bullshit excuses for why you deserve what you have and everybody else doesn’t. We’ve seen behind the curtain and witnessed the Wizards who operate all the machines, and we can never unsee it. So, if it takes a month, a year or eternity, I will continue investing everything I can and will continue to educate myself about the markets that run this entire planet. I will first, take care of my family. Afford them a nice, not extravagant life, and then I will throw everything else into making this world a better place. And I will not stop doing that until the day that I die. That is a fucking promise. And there is nothing you can ever say to deter me.",2021-05-16 15:05:55

Moon phases and AMC,1616825058.0,"As we all know by now, we're headed to the Moon with AMC. So I looked into seeing if the moon phases has anything to do with the stock price. Here is what I found out in 2021.

New Moon - Tuesday Jan 12th - $2.34 
The first couple of weeks in 2021 it hovered around $2, it's low point for the stock price.

Slowly increased until the squeeze.

Full Moon - Thursday Jan 28th - Squeeze hit on the 27th and 28th. At the time of the full moon the price was in the middle of a George W between $20+ both days. This was the first victory for both AMC and all the gorillas. AMC was saved from probable bankruptcy and got rid of most of its debt.

Hedgies then shorted the shit out of the stock and it dropped. Over 2 weeks there were  8 of 10 red days. This is when new gorillas, retards and autists joined the war against the hedge fucks.

New Moon - Thursday Feb 11th - $5.64 
This is around when it hit the bottom after the first squeeze. Gorillas averaged down and we started becoming the majority owners of AMC.

Slowly goes up week by week.

Full Moon - Saturday Feb 27th - $8.20
Only 12 hours earlier the Gorilla Gang fought the epic battle for $8.01. A day that we will tell our rich children and grandchildren about.

Up and down 2 weeks. 6 red and 4 green. Slow grind.

New Moon - Saturday Mar 13th - $11.34 

Total fuckery by hedge fucks while the SEC watches.

Full Moon - Sunday Mar 28th - We're currently sitting at about $10.24. Could shoot up come Monday after the fuckery of this last week and everyone reloading and buying the dip. As we all know this should be at about $16-$20 but massive manipulation, naked shorts, dark pools and all the rest resulted in the first bad week after 5 weeks of gains, and good news.

So what I've seen so far is on new moons we've had lows or lulls in gains. On full moons we've had some huge battles, and I think we could see another victory come Monday.

Next New Moon - Sunday April 11th - I predict we could be anywhere from $15 - $25.

Next Full Moon - Monday April 26th - I believe this could be the week we reach our destination, or at least we'll be on our way. Whether that is $100, $500, $1,000 or $2,008.01.

Not financial advice, just a guy who looks up to our future destination.",2021-03-26 23:04:18

Robinhood sucks, it’s no secret that they are doing the shadiest of shady business and I didn’t want to see them scramble during the squeeze with server errors or liquidity issues again. I say this to all looking to transfer, yes it’s scary for a few days, yes you can’t buy or sell when transferring, but you weren’t looking to sell anyways dorks. And you can buy more with the broker you are transferring to. There is no better time to drop RH. The stocks have been buried for the rest of the week and if a squeeze happened soon anyways it would take a while to peak. If you are still on the fence about leaving RH, just keep in mind that you are running out of time. The longer you wait, the closer you will be to the inevitable squeeze.

These past few months have been great to be a part of, our time to shine is inevitable. We all must be calm as we see price shifts begin to talk place. This is a black swan event, in the uncertainty we must remain calm. I haven’t been too deep on GME DD recently, But AMC is owned 80% by retail investors. We control the price. Once AMC is over, AMC army will back GME. And I would hope vice versa should timing be different. Let’s play it smart and strategic, this is the first time where us retail investors can communicate and play our cards right. Let’s change the world and have a positive impact.

"Alrighty stonkist, it’s time to talk about psywarfare.",1617678522.0,"So with the recent exodus of r/GME it got me thinking, this won’t be the last time this happens. And that won’t be the last sub to be attacked. We have seen it with WSB, WSBElite, all the other WSB spore groups and off shoots. Is r/AMCstock next? r/superstonk will definitely have crosshairs on its back, but what I’m getting at is that any sub that has anything to do with AMC or GME is going to be a target. 

We have moved into new territory with the fight, we had spies at first, and we dealt with the cultural subversion tactics that threatened morale. But this feels different, we are coming to an important fork in the road. What I mean by this, is that we are reaching the point of Burn Out. Whether we want to admit it or not, things are starting to wear on everyone. And that is perfectly normal, we are excited and we want these stocks to squeeze...HARD! 

But having said that this has been a real journey, I hadn’t really thought about it till today but I have been waking up early and manically flipping through DD with one eye and scanning tickers with the other for a fourth of 2021. A fourth of my year has been spent in anticipation of me being rich. I think about what I will do with my earnings, I daydream about paying off my parents bills. I think about getting a new dog and traveling with it, I have planned my trips and what charities I’m going to donate to. I think about my life and others changing all while being part of a great community. And while I’m doing all this, there is a tiny lizard part of my brain that has been scratching at my skull whispering “when?” 

When will I win? And when can I finally not worry about bills? That lizard part of my brain wiggles it’s way into my happy thoughts and pokes me in the eye asking “are we there yet?”

Of course we aren’t, I know this. 

But I notice it, and I think this might be why things feel a little different right now. But then I also realized that I only think this way when I get back on Reddit and think about the squeeze. I camped for the three day weekend we just had and I don’t think I muttered the word stocks for 72 hours. It was fantastic, I didn’t even need to think about bills, or being rich. I just had to find fire wood, rocks to climb and fish to catch. 

What I am ultimately getting at is that we all need to keep level minds and take breaks when we can. Remember that the hedge funds have ran out of a lot of tricks as of late. Regulation after regulation have been put in place and we have been trading sideways for days. So what would be their next available tactic? 

Psychological warfare.

And remember we have become jaded to their earlier tactics. We laugh and buy on dips, we don’t read financial news anymore and we do the opposite of what most financial advisors say because you are smart and have read the DD. We all understand how this works, we have put some wrinkles on our brains and we understand how this will end. But the one thing we don’t know for certain is how our fellow ape will react to this. And the Hedge funds are going to play into this most of all. I think this is why there is now volatility in some of our favorite subs. The shills and FUD accounts comments didn’t hurt when we were all having fun and things were exciting. But now even mods are flipping... 

That’s why I urge you all to pay attention to that little voice in your head. Is it getting louder? Are you questioning something you have definitive proof of? Are you questioning numbers and facts you have triple checked because you are getting impatient? Well, if so, it’s time for a break. We all need a reset. 

Please remember to be nice to one another and look out for each other as well. We quite literally are all in this together and this very well could be the hedge funds last push to divide us so we fracture and make rash decisions. 

Furthermore I would like to take this time to call out to the sub and ask what can we all do to protect ourselves from burnout and keep our sub safe from fuckery. What can we do as mods to keep the will strong and the camaraderie going? 

TL;DR do yourself a favor and reset. We have to work, sometimes multiple jobs. take care of kids, family, parents. Do household things all while the hedge managers get to live lavishly and try to tear us down so we don’t get our rightful payout. Burnout is imminent, but we will get through it together.",2021-04-05 20:08:42

APES WORLDWIDE UNITE: Japanese Apes Calling for TWEETSTORM SUPPORT!! Hashtag #楽天証券無能 (Rakuten Securities incompetent),1622672911.0,"[u/StupidMonsters](https://www.reddit.com/user/StupidMonsters/):

Rakuten Securities won’t let us apes vote because according to them they use Interactive Brokers as their US custodian and the shares are under Rakuten and not under our names!

THIS IS JUST AN EXCUSE!

Tiger Brokers who use Interactive Brokers as their US custodian under Tiger Brokers name let apes vote because of high demand for voting! IF THEY WORK THE SAME AS RAKUTEN THEN RAKUTEN HAS NO EXCUSE! THEY ARE LAZY AND INCOMPETENT!

Let’s get 楽天証券無能 (Rakuten Securities incompetent) trending on Twitter!!!

Anyone who is Japanese or international, knows Japanese or even just google translate is enough!!! We need to push them to let us VOTE!

Please, this is a cry for help. Most Japanese GME holders don’t know about the DD so there has not been a big movement yet. I’m trying my best to inform people around me but there’s not much I can do alone.

I have so much love and respect for all you Apes!

Me: I think Rakuten Securities can vote on my behalf, is that possible?

R: Unfortunately, we don't do that. We apologize for not meeting your wishes.

Me: What institution is the custodian of my shares?

R: We will prepare the information. Excuse me a moment. Sorry to keep you waiting.

There WILL be a consistent wall at 14.01...what are we to do?,1616206522.0," **NONE of this is financial advice...just market dynamic education:**

The weasel hedgies have made this their line in the sand...that is clear! The lack of price bounce in the last few hours between 13.95 and 14.05 during this witching day (which is supposed to be chaotically volatile) shows how desperate they are to keep that number. It's not ladder attacks now...it's buy/sell walls!

CAN we make 14.01 like 8.01? Yes, with a concentrated effort. It's like flood walls during a hurricane: they hold and hold against the battering...but if there is enough battering they break away and flood the city unopposed. The same is here. Don't hang back by the buoys hoping others break it down so you can just flow into the city.

Yes, if a whale or two hit the flood wall it will also break...but the hurricane itself can tear down the wall if it is strong enough, consistent enough, and persistent enough.

The hedgies have piled up the sand bags at 14.01. We are the hurricane. Will we be stopped or will we break through? It is all up to each and every one of us.

Shills and stuff...,1619293805.0,"Okay, we know they are not going away— and it’s only going to get more intense and sketchy around here. Learn to ignore them. Here are what I see as some of the current trending shill techniques…I hope I’m wrong, but I don’t think so.

**TL;DR: DOWNVOTE. IGNORE. HOLD.**

1. a. For the AMC shareholders. Bringing up share dilution. Snore. Nobody fucking cares anymore. This has been dealt with and whether you voted yes or no, AMC cares about its shareholders, and we are them. The End. That’s all I need to know. And if you watched Adam Aron’s interview with Trey from Trey’s Trades you would know it, too.
b. For the GME shareholders, there is an upcoming vote. Call your broker. Find out how to vote. Most of us didn’t get that info yet. Chill. Have a banana. You didn’t miss anything. My broker only sends out those emails one month before the vote. 
2. Posting typical FUD statements that start with things like, “I’m not a shill, but…” or “I know you all want confirmation bias, but…” Real apes don’t say shit like that. They present findings and let them speak for themselves. They engage in intelligent, but retarded, conversations with alternative views without getting mean or defensive or insulting. When it crosses that line, ignore and downvote.
3. The QAnon shit is kinda new and incredibly fucking lame. These are red herrings designed specifically to invoke shame, fear, and insecurity through the use of associative symbols and social stigma. They usually start with the word “cult” which has been used more in this past week than ever before, and even has been used to cut down the some of the most devoted, ape-hearted greatest DD experts out there. Anyway, cults are founded on things that aren’t real or concrete. They’re based on feelings, not facts. Do your own DD on every fucking stock you own and ignore everything else. It really is that simple. For those of you who hate doing DD, just check the TL; DR section. It’s the spark notes of DD! How most of us got through high school--if we got through at all.
4. Suddenly, people who claim to be devoted apes are saying the subs suck. This one is funny, because, well, some of these subs ARE really dark and twisty—mostly they're that way because we’re BORED by the sideways trading. Apes don’t talk shit about other apes, they don't fight other apes, and they are usually very good-natured about pointing out weird shit. If we have a problem with someone, we address it. Boom. Done. We don’t post long generic complaints about the entire sub or its members. That’s not a thing. We don’t sow hatred or resentment between anyone. Which leads me to point #5.
5. The political shit of trying to play us vs. them is old hat and totally dumb, but still alive and well. Politics are stupid. Nobody cares about us. Let’s move on...

Okay, I fucking love you all. I like the idea that all over the world there are people like me who are sick of living on the sidelines of what’s supposed to be a free world. Don’t doubt yourselves. You know the deal. You are beautiful apes with beautiful brains—smooth *and* wrinkled. And most of you are pretty fucking smart—too smart to fall for this bullshit.

Good Morning “I like the stocks”,1617829903.0,I woke up this morning and like so many checked pre market reports and as it has been for the last 3 months GME and AMC are all over the headlines.

Their latest tactic has been to remind us American apes that we will all pay out the fucking ass in taxes. Which is definitely something to keep in mind, taxes are a very real thing. You will pay 30-40% of what you take away from this. Which is good! It’s how our economy and government continues to work. 

But what you should be reading in between their ham fisted lines is their admission of defeat. Why talk about realized returns and taxable sums? Because they know it’s over, even their payed politicians and news outlets are turning their backs on them. 

That’s the sound of hammering you hear, and Shitadel is running out of coffin nails. Get your fucking shovels ready, they are actively digging their graves, we just have to be kind enough to fill the holes back in.

I've Had It With These HedgeFKer's,1616576837.0,"So here's the deal fellow Apes. We need to get more aggressive with these assholes. I have gotten to a point where I REALLY REALLY want to hurt these dicks. Sick to death of these games they are playing. They are trading BORROWED shares back and forth to each other and changing the sell price by pennies each time and driving the stock down. And when they get it down, they buy long and ride it as it comes up again. All of these games have kept them in the game so far. We need to change the rules. They are doing this to us with OUR shares that they are borrowing from our various brokerages. And they are borrowing those shares at ridiculously low interest rates right now. I no longer trust ANY of the stock establishment. Brokers, supposedly ""trusted"" agencies for information, etc. I believe they are ALL now in this war against us together to preserve the way of life and status quo they have all always enjoyed. We threaten to bring one hell of a lot of shit crashing down around one hell of a lot of heads. And it will have serious ramifications throughout the entire ""establishment"", because of how deep the HF's are in trouble over this stock. WE OWN 80% OF THIS STOCK FOR SHIT'S SAKE!!! So what do we need to do? We need to own 90% of this freakin' stock. AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US NEEDS TO DO WHATEVER IS REQUIRED TO TURN OFF STOCK LENDING BY YOUR BROKER ON YOUR AMC STOCK. And don't say my broker doesn't do that. It isn't true. They ALL do that unless you take whatever steps needed through that broker to turn it off, and it varies by broker. So research it, do it. If we own 80+ percent of this stock and they can't borrow it.... we will bring a quick close to this happy horse shit! JMHO

Well Damn..........,1616225169.0,"Spent a good portion of today driving to and from, and in, the Boise VA Medical Center getting a colonoscopy done. 2nd one in 3 months. The last one they removed a pretty large polyp (over an inch) that turned out to be non cancerous in the biopsy. But they wanted a follow up to see how that area looked and if they needed to scrape some more out. They did. But while checking all that out, they found another. This one over and inch and a half. More problematic than that is that it is an ugly abnormal color and so firm it couldn't be removed. Doctor flat out told me this isn't good. I said as in cancer? To which she replied yes. A doctor will NEVER tell you something like that without seeing the biopsy report unless they are pretty damn sure of what they are looking at sigh............ Maybe she's wrong. One way or another I now have to go back AGAIN and this time get it all cut out. And so my AMC dreams become even more real to me now. I am a pretty simple guy. Did 15 years as a rock n roll radio DJ right out of high school. Went into the Navy from there and did 23 years and retired as a Chief Petty Officer. Haven't even been out 10 years yet. Bottom line? Just an average Joe like MOST of you. Lived paycheck to paycheck most of my life. Have been concentrating on building some kind of inheritance I can pass to my daughter when I kick it. The house and property will be hers and is now worth about $250.000. But like I said. Just an everyday guy like most of you. I own 1613 shares of AMC. I have envisioned being able to actually say I was a MILLIONARE soon, when this stock does what I know it will do eventually. Something I never remotely even dreamed would be something I could say in my life. My daughter is my beneficiary on TD Ameritrade. If it turns out I make her a millionaire instead.

Post on GME being shorted through ETF’s today,1615884102.0,"I think it's quite evident they shorted GME through ETFs. Request for DD

Listen, I am as dense as a jungle bush when it comes to stock market. But I noticed a few things, most likely others did too. To anyone that wants to do some DD: I think it's quite clear they used ETF's to short GME again, which are not on the SSR list. In other words, they are shorting ETFs to bypass SSR.

I just took a glance at some of the known ETFs that hedgies are known to have shorted. Notice the EOW amount of shares available and the ones that appeared available this monday morning on the market open:


https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IJR? - IJR, 900k available EOW, 500k available monday morning

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/VIOG? - VIOG, 9k available EOW, 2k available monday morning

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/XRT? - XRT, 1.3MM available EOW, 850k available monday morning

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GAMR - GAMR, 15k available EOW, 3k available monday morning

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/RETL - RETL, 20k available EOW, 800 available monday morning

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IWM - IWM, 6.5MM available EOW, 4MM available monday morning

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/IJS - IJS, 500k available EOW, 300k available monday morning

Notice how on most of these the shares start returning at 9:45. To my smoothbrain this sort of coordination reeks of something fucky at play. There are more timeframes that these things happen if you look further down the history.

These are just a few that I checked out. There's most certainly more ETFs that follow this pattern. I ask for any smarter ape out there to explain this action rationally to me like I was just born or for someone to do further digging on this.

Edit: 9:45 is also around the timeframe when GME started dipping. They seem to have used multiple ETFs to switch between and keep a constant sell pressure on GME without needing to borrow from GME directly. Most ETFs also have a lower interest rate.

Edit 2: This might also be what DFV was referring to in his 'Ridin' dirty' tweet.

Edit 3: Seems like the cat's out of the bag. [Just look at these perfectly aligning graphs between XRT and GME!](https://i.imgur.com/I9wnEgi.jpg) Thanks u/MurrE1310 for sharing!",2021-03-16 01:41:42

You wouldn't even believe some of the stories LOL. And I intend to live several more years. But.... in the event I don't.... my AMC dreams become the inherited dreams of my daughter. That said-

I want to now urge everyone to do what I urged everyone against for a long time on this sub. Set whatever shares you own to SELL every single day at the MAX whatever your particular brokerage allows. We are being fought by the hedgefkers borrowing our own shares everyday. We HAVE TO STOP THE BORROWING OF OUR SHARES. If you set whatever shares you own to sell everyday, your brokerage cant lend them! But you MUST stay on top of this daily. I can only set my sell limit to $100 on TD Ameritrade. Once we rocket, it will blow past that in a couple hours. So you have to be on top of it. And keep changing it as you can to higher limits.

We squash their ability to borrow and the interest rate to borrow (the REAL rocket fuel) shoots up fast. We (the retail investor) own over 80% of this stock. The ONLY reason they are able to hang in with us this far and play the games they have been successful at playing is because our brokers are lending OUR shares to them at ridiculously low interest rates to do it with. If your shares are earmarked to sell, your brokerage can't lend them. WE HAVE TO SHUT DOWN THE LENDING!!!!",2021-03-26 02:52:58

When the price looks too high, you see those lower sells slide right in. None of it means a thing until the MOASS. That means that we don't actually have to watch the ticker. Except that we want to watch it change and we keep waiting for the squeeze. So, take it as you will. I still play my slots app, because it's fun.

Important AMC Information - Going into Friday Trading Day,1622810910.0,"To all you beautiful, smooth-brained Apes and Apettes, remember these points going into tomorrow’s trading day.

1. AMC is done with share offerings for the 2021 calendar year. This was confirmed by Adam Aron personally during his interview with Trey’s Trades this afternoon. Any further shares offered to the market HAS to be approved by shareholders. In fact, there is a proposal on the table for this round of voting to offer an additional 25 million shares to be used in 2022. Keep in mind that yes, although offering shares into the market does dilute the share count, it is literally a drop of water in an ocean of 500 million/day of trading volume. These share offerings raise cash capital for AMC which they can then leverage for growth. Growth in any company benefits the company, the shareholders, and ultimately the value of the stock.
Source: [https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Files-Preliminary-Proxy-Statement-Voting-to-Begin-June-16-2021/default.aspx]

2. According to the official share count as of 06/02: “As of June 2, AMC had 501,780,240 shares outstanding that will be entitled to a vote at the upcoming Shareholder Meeting.” This share count represents all shareholders worldwide based on settled trades of shares on June 2. Options and other stock derivatives are not counted in this number and have no voting power. 
*Source: https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Announces-Outstanding-Share-Count-Ahead-of-July-29-2021-Shareholder-Meeting/default.aspx

3. The piece on Mudrick Capital selling the 8.5 million shares they bought from AMC is a mixed bag with some potentially factual information twisted and construed Into a big, steaming pile of FUD shite. It is likely that Mudrick did in fact liquidate there shares. However, as Adam Aron himself said, there is no definitive proof or documentation directly from Mudrick stating that AMC stock is overvalued. Again, the media may have sprinkled in a couple of facts into a pile of FUD to twist the story. Take it for what it is, FAKE NEWS.

4. The fundamentals of why we are here hasn’t changed. Yes, we saw an 18% pullback today. Maybe we’ll see another pullback tomorrow, or maybe we will rip above $100. Who knows? The point is, until all of the shorts have covered, there hasn’t been a short squeeze. Prepare yourself for volatility. Hedge funds and others taken short positions against AMC are literally losing billions of dollars and will play every little dirty trick they can to scare off, shake off, and fuck off paper hands. Dips are opportunities to buy more shares at a discounted price. It is as simple as that. If you’re just going to get scared with every dip and paper hands, jump off of the rocket now. You are just adding unnecessary weight to our max load that we don’t need. For the rest of my Diamond Handed, Diamond Balls apes, You know the drill. 

5. We are nearing the end game and shorts know it. They continue to double and triple down on their short positions adding nitrous oxide on top of the rocket fuel they have been pumping in over the last few months. We know this because of all of the FUD being spread, simulated sell offs that have happened in the past week, and of course because of the general amped up level of fuckery being pulled. 

Stay strong, stick together, don’t believe the negative information you see in the news without doing your own DD and confirming the info for yourself, buckle up, get your game face on, and HODL. THE. DUCKING. LINE.

Too many people who get sudden wealth find themselves destitute a short time later because they felt they deserved the car, or the house, or the coke.....

This WILL happen...the math is close to irrefutable.  I hope when it does, the talk is just talk and apes will take care of themselves and loved ones for life.  I would HATE to see apes on the news having lost it all....

MOASS Market Wide Implications,1621248253.0,"I'm a smooth brained ape so take this all with a grain of salt, just a theory I have and would love to hear others thoughts.

We are all aware of how the MOASS will certainly bankrupt every hedgefund shorting GME, and how this could very well be the trigger for the next market crash. There are many factors contributing to the likelihood of a crash, i.e. overvalued stocks, inflation, hedgefund liquidation, record high levels of margin debt, and the repeat of the housing crash but through commercial real estate properties that have been overstating their revenues (there's some great DD on this). GME will be the final massive straw that breaks the camel's back. Nearly every stock that has seen massive rallies this past year, particularly tech stocks, will get absolutely slaughtered as a sell off ensues. Many have already noted how a bloody market could send many more investors to the few green stocks amongst the chaos.

GME will be the shining beacon on the hill, the greatest stock to ever exist, and fomo as well as red portfolios could push a surge of new traders into the stock. However I want to think about the market wide implications of the squeeze. I think AMC has a high likelihood of squeezing as well given a similar effect that GME will see, an influx of new buyers to the few green stocks in a red market. However I think it will expand past just AMC and GME, I think every stock with high short interest will see large rallies during a market correction, that they too will get squeezed. Some of the stocks that come to mind for me are weed stocks (i.e. SNDL, ACB, TLRY) other ""memestocks"" that saw large buying pressure during January (i.e. BB, BBBY, EXPR, KOSS, BBW) and potentially some EV favorites however I'm skeptical on these given the global chip shortages. Many hedgefunds that are shorting GME were also major players going short on these other stocks. I'm not completely sure how bankruptcies caused by GME would effect their other short positions however and would love to hear some thoughts on this.

I think crypto will certainly see major sell offs at the start of the crash which I think will be much more prolonged, potentially 6 months to a year till the bottom is found, however I think it would occur quicker than all the other stocks in the market given their innate volalitity. I think as inflation rocks the market and consumers, crypto could see a large bounce off a major sell off and it too could see a large amount of buyers enter either during the MOASS or post MOASS. Personally I intend to put some tendies into cyrpto and don't think I'm alone and would love to buy a tasty dip.

I think this upcoming crash will see retail traders take a massive foothold in the market, infact greater than a foothold, retail traders with the money made through GME and the other stocks I listed will make retail traders a huge player in the market, a serious force to be reckoned with and no short will be safe. I've tried describing this to my friends as retail traders turning over a massive stone, coming out of our caves, and entering the market with the ability to move any stock we like. The beginning of a financial revolution.

I'd love to come back to this in 6 months and see how accurate my prediction was. Again, this is just a theory for fun of how I think the crash will go.

TLDR: I think the next market crash will see an influx of buyers to the few green stocks in the market which will be GME and other heavily shorted stocks. I also think crypto will see a large rally after a large to massive sell off.

Share Recount,1617596683.0,"I haven’t heard a lot on this in awhile and just want some clarification. From what I understand all fake shares must be purchased (then thanos dusted) before May 4th correct. The fact that they will only let shareholders vote that have real shares is a key part to everything. Am I right or is there a way for them to not have to purchase those synthetic shares back before May 4th? 

It seems like we celebrated this and then forgot it was even happening which makes me wonder what I am missing? 

If they must repurchase those shares before May 4th it will clearly boost the stock price drastically also driving up the FOMO and squeeze potential ect. 

Not financial advice really just asking a question I’m not sure of the answer to.

Point 72 from 3 days ago with an update to position in GME,1617231345.0,"  

Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of r/GME. 

Moderators remove posts from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil, and true to their purpose. (I have absolutely no idea what's wrong with it) 

So in my post about Goldman Sachs I posted links for bad news on our friend Ken Griffin & Citadel. I was asked to make a post on each of dear friends involved with this whole international incident. I call it that because of the stockholders world wide and the many international investigations that are occurring. The ask was to remind us of who the apes are up against. So tonight I bring you Point 72 & Steve Cohen. It was a lot easier to find the bad news than it was with Griffin and Citadel, must not have a very good PR department.



As a reminder:

Don’t post positions

Remove stop losses

don’t forget to remove sell limits

No MOASS date predictions

The less they can see and mine the better off we are.

And as always not financial or investment advice.

"I know buy and hodl AMC is boring, but take heart!!!",1620613485.0,"The top 1% bank on the perceptions of this ""microwave generation""...instant gratification, instant results, waiting is for losers.  This is seen not just in the market, but all over our society.  This is why they think they can wait us out because we have so many of the ""microwave generation"" in our midst.

We in here know this is true...we just call them ""paper hands""!  They get upset that AMC is not moving like some meme crypto, so they go chasing those gains...then they see another stock go up quick and chase them...then the next...The first sign of resistance, they move on and run away!

Let me offer a couple of nuggets of encouragement, if I can.

I take heart that massive institutions like Vanguard are joining our numbers.  We are limited in our DD by our resources and connections...they are not!  They are not chasing the quick buck!  That they are in and are joining us in large numbers is HUGE!

The CEO is clearly with us.  How many companies or cryptos or whatever do YOU know where the CEO is directly communicating with its ""smaller"" investors?  Even if you don't trust a member of the 1%, our interests right now are definitely aligned (how many shares does he own again?).

The math is so clearly with us right now.  We KNOW that retail holds 80+%.  We KNOW that there are millions of fraudulent shares out there.  We KNOW that the weasel HFs are limited in what they can do, as it is costing them exponentially every day they try (comparted to us, since it costs us NOTHING to hold).  We KNOW the movie market is opening back up and the YoY numbers are GUARANTEED to skyrocket.

In investing, this is a TON going in our favor.  What is really working against us?  Not much!  The company is NOT going bankrupt, so shares are not going to 0.  We literally have nothing to lose by waiting them out.

Let's bring more apes into our religion of AMC.  Let's show the 1% just how screwed they are.  Let's become that example for others to follow, and do good with our wealth.  Above all, even though it is boring, let's buy, hodl and promote!!!

**Tl:dr - Buy, HODL, promote AMC, and remain steadfast: AMC holders are not the microwave generation but a religion unto ourselves!!!**",2021-05-09 19:24:45

Why we have to stop thinking,1616289573.0,"# How we can win every war upon us !!

**We shall fight!**

*But we need weapons* 

We have to u*nderstand where our strength derives from and what our true weapons are. Is it a retail army of thousand ? is it Ape knowledge ? is it Ape will ? is it Ape coordination ? is it Ape community? Is it Ape understanding ?* 

But first. Who are we really fighting against ? Who is our enemy, and what are his strengths ? --------

# --- HEDGIES

They have hundreds of billions, hundreds of billions at their disposal, hundreds of billions centralised to be moved at their will.

They have thousands of employees, thousands of traders, hundreds of analysts, hundreds of psychologists, hundreds of lawyers - And thousands trusting them with their hard earned money !

They have millions in software, millions in hardware and millions worth of data. 

Fuck, they probably have whole governments and politicians, banks and institutions - Money is power. 

**BUT**

Here we are stupid, retarded apes. We are smelly and ugly, stupid and limited, we are the exact kind of people Hedgies spit on and we are the exact kind of people squeezed by their foot soles. 

Still, WHO GOT SQUEEZED at $GME ? 

Apes found a way to fight back, to fight for their money, to fight for their freedom!

The great battle of $GME is won by underestimating us, but now they know who we are ! And they shall fight back !

""They have thousands of employees, thousands of traders, hundreds of analysts, hundreds of psychologists, hundreds of lawyers - And thousands trusting them with their hard earned money"" stacked against us. 

# They shall fight and they shall win!!

and there is only one thing we can do !

STOP THINKING 

They read our DD\`s, they read our posts, they analyse our behaviour, they predict when we sell and buy. They know what we are planning and they know how we will proceed. 

But one thing they can\`t is know how we feel. 

Our emotions are the only weapon that can win this war - This revolution. 

We hate HF, we don\`t like HF, we angry, we apes. We like banana, we like welfare, we like world, we like stock, we apes!! 

We have emotions, ethics and ideals. 

We buy stock we like, we buy stock at market price, we don\`t buy dips. We don\`t act rational, we do not plan, we do not sell, we do not care about profits, we do not THINK - WE APES 

We do all of that, and HF cant win, cant predict, cant react - Apes win, we make world a better place, we take back what is stolen of us!

Reminds me of a sadistic gym teacher I had back in high school, who once punished us with burpees.  While we were wheezing with sweat beads, he was mocking us by saying how useless we were.  He was rooting us on to collapse disgracefully.  This was no reverse psychology, as evidenced at the end of that session, when we stood our ground, and he growled a curse and broke his fist punching the wall.  He underestimated the motive that united us, we hated him with a passion and we would not allow the prick any satisfaction.

The shadowy forces manipulating our shares presume that we'll fall like any typical investor.  They presume that they can easily get to us with the emotional roller coasters of fluctuations.  But they are wrong.  They are the ones who will deal with unending frustration for messing with us.  As they throw everything at us, we will spite them by remaining stubborn.

53% rebound and moon bound,1616813484.0,"4. -- GameStop Shares Rebound 53%
GameStop  (GME)  was rising nearly 10% in premarket trading Friday after the video game retailer, a favorite of the Reddit crowd, jumped nearly 53% in the previous session and recouped its $4.3 billion loss in value after earnings disappointed.
The stock rose 9.69% to $201.56 in premarket trading Friday.
According to data from Dow Jones, the stock's gain Thursday was its largest since Feb. 24, when it soared 104%. 
More than 50 million shares traded Thursday, which was 296% of the stock's five-day average volume and 147% of its 30-day average volume, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
The stock plunged earlier this week after GameStop posted softer-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and said it was evaluating the sale of new shares to fund its ""future transformation initiatives and general working capital needs.""
GameStop has been moving to shake up its senior management team, tapping Chewy.com founder Ryan Cohen to lead its e-commerce strategy. It named Jenna Owens, a former Google  (GOOGL)  Amazon.com  (AMZN)  executive, as chief operating officer.",2021-03-26 19:51:24

Sometimes I wonder how we at AMC got this far....,1621310870.0,"Every time I saw a post today claiming ""Battle for 14.01"" it made me shake my head in amusement.  How can we be this far into the war and not understand something so fundamental?  There can be no ""war for 14.01"" or ANY number on a Monday...the HFs really don't care about a Monday number!  They care in the sense of psychologically holding us down, but 13.99 vs 14.01 does not matter with no options on the line!

THEN I thought about this from the hedge fund perspective and what they may be thinking when they read this...

""Man, these idiots have no CLUE what they are saying or doing, yet they are STILL beating the pants off us!!!  They must REALLY be smooth-brained apes!!!""

Why it’s easy to hodl right now,1616670031.0,"Not financial advice

Starting with GME - I watched my stock go from $480+ to $40. It sucked but I believe $480 is nothing compared to what it can and will do. If I thought $480 was the max I would have sold. 

AMC I bought in at $13.95 and have averaged down but I only averaged down because I believe in the stock. I again believe this stock has moon potential. 

Some quick basic reasons why. GME freaking called out a short squeeze in their earning report. I have watched earnings reports in the past (investing or selling clues) and “never have I ever” (great drinking game) heard a company call out a short squeeze. Then I look at the volume and the rest of the market. The volume still screams that this stock is being held like only one other (AMC its stock brother). 

Now why I still hold AMC. One freaking duh I have held through this crap before. More than that though and it’s like we all forgot about this. They are doing a freaking share count right now. I personally have no idea when they are going to force the synthetic shares to be purchased but there is zero chance in hell I sell these shares with no squeeze until after May 4th. If we remember AMC CEO called out the shorts and said a lot of people are going to make some money by buying our shares (not an exact quote). Why the F would I walk away from a CEO saying dude just hold and I’ll make you money. 

Literally all of I have to do I put up with the hedgies BS and I can end up being a millionaire. I will easily say okay to this. 

TL:DR
GME AMC hodl. GME and AMC moon. Millionaire

Apes 🦍 v Snake 🐍,1622833879.0,"Alrighty, where do I start? Well, it’s going to be a bit of a long post but worth reading, especially for new apes and I will try to use ape language as much a possible.

First question on many apes minds, when Lambo? Well, no one really know, not what you wanted to hear, but it is what it is! One thing i guarantee though, that if you don’t hold the line, the answer for you is, NEVER! 

Apes, you have to realize, nothing in this life is free and it takes time to get from point A to point B.  It takes most babies on average 7-8 month to learn how to walk. In stonks, once you made a trade, forget about the money you invested and just trust the process. Your banana is gone to work for you. Apes who have been here since January, got in when the price was like $5, last night it closed at $51.34 - we are in month 6 now! 

We are fighting against the establishment that is standing to lose everything, business, money, their fucking boats, their kids will not go to posh schools, they won’t be able to higher chefs, nannies. Now do you really think they want to lose everything to a bunch of crayon eating retards, ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT!!! Not only they will lose the money and lifestyles, they will lose their credibility and careers. Don’t forget, they manage other peoples money, wealthy peoples money!! Those wealthy 1% are standing to lose too much. Hence the constant FUD from the media, those people own the fucking media, they will not give you anything for free. Collectively, the wealthy 1% can end world hunger, yet, it still exists! So, do they give a fuck about you, absolutely fucking not!!! They want you to be poor and work for them so they can get richer off us breaking your back! 

Do you know see what this movement is about.

The media will tell you to sell, your friends will tell you to sell, fuck, your mom will tell you to sell. Cause they have no idea what you are about to make. What are we standing to make you ask? Generational fuck you money, that’s what!

Did anyone ever gave you anything for free, probably not. Don’t expect to get a free anything from the 1%.

However, this movement has attracted a lot of attention from big players, Cuban, Mr Wonderful, smaller fund managers who try to educate apes, Black Fucking Rock for fuck sakes, do you understand this, these guys believe in you more than you believe in yourself! We are changing this game forever and writing history. And all we have to do is buy and hodl. I repeat that again, buy and hodl, that simple.

This is not a financial advice, i am just a talking monkey with anxiety who likes green crayons and stonks!

Ps. AA’s naked shorts at the end, is it a conspiracy theory and the old silver back lost hist marbles or was he channeling his inner Michael Jackson, i don’t know. But, Harvard educated professional C level exec, who has life and business experience probably has a plan!

Good morning San Diago,

I am Rensole,

# The letter to the board

Well this is important, or at least to me, the letter has been signed and stopped collection signatures and has been delivered to the board with 32,180 signitures.

All we can do now is wait!

# Failed to delivers

As you can see from the data below it shows that GME has close to 300,000 failed to delivered stocks... but they closed their positions right?

Now I have to give a HUGE shoutout to  [u/aNinjaAtNight](https://www.reddit.com/user/aNinjaAtNight/)  he was so awesome he checked the FTD's of EVERY ETF that contains GME, so check out his thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m63jfb/ftd_of_62_etfs_that_contained_gme/)

the most important one is his exel sheet he's got [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PZ2-hnCtDNRnbE8Wm5ByudBcg26T3lGjsec9bSE9x9I/edit#gid=0)

his research shows that the ETF's on their own are close to 900,000 FTD shares

So that makes a total of 1,200,000 FTD's.

And please keep in mind Shorts and FTD's are all self reported, so it could be a lot more than this.

Unfortunately we've learned that sometimes the data can be unreliable.

&#x200B;

The FTD's of the ETF's also fall in line with GME being shorted VIA the ETF's

[https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m5v1xy/i\_think\_its\_quite\_evident\_they\_shorted\_gme/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m5v1xy/i_think_its_quite_evident_they_shorted_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

&#x200B;

Also keep in mind these are JUST the FTD's that are traded with the DTCC, this does not account for the ones traded OUTSIDE of the DTCC. (there was an entire thread going into detail why this was important but I can't seem to find it atm if anyone can link me I'd really appreciate it).

# the name is Bonds, Shit bonds.

So what else have we seen in the past days, oh right The bonds!

So what do these bonds mean? very simply put, Citadel needs money.

A lot of money.

[https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/videos/capital-markets-view-february-2021](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/videos/capital-markets-view-february-2021)

lets speculate for a moment, Citadel has been paying a lot of money to be able to kick the can down the road, like a lot of money, billions at this point. and to be honest they will try to elongate this as long as possible.

These guys are used to winning, so don't expect them to take this all laying down, expect fuckery, expect dips expect bots spreading FUD and bullshit.

the thing that was eye catching to me in the bonds are a few things.

1. Ratings BBB- (S&P)this is just above shit tier, BBB- is bad
2. Coupon 3.375%This is a high bond yield % so them offering such a high % shows how badly they need the money
3. Notes Proceeds for general corporate purposesAKA gib money for bonusses.

# DTCC Rules?

ok so I'm going to copy pasta the entire post here as the original OP is no longer on Reddit.

Posting this for u/Swimmerchild

Since I have you all here this is my post

So the SR-NSCC-2021-801 filing that we have been waiting for is one step closer to passing.

[https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/sec-rule-filings)

Today the DTC submitted a filing DTC-2021-003 which eliminated the requirement that a Participant must confirm its activity statements monthly through DTC’s Participant Inquiry Notification System (PINS) system. In short the HF’s and MM’s no longer have to submit data to DTC/DTCC monthly on shorts, longs, or any other relevant information that can be used for the monthly risk assessment that is currently being used. Best part is that the Deputy General Counsel of the DTC approved this change on January 14, 2020 and the Effective date is listed as “The proposed rule change would become effective upon filling” which this was filed today, March 15, 2021.

The SR-NSCC-2021-801 is an advance notice filing that only required the SEC to approve before NSCC “Implements proposed rule changes no later than 10 business days after approval by the Commission”. For those of you too smooth to remember the 801 will allow the NSCC to assess the risk of members daily and let them demand a higher Secondary Liquidity Deposit (SLD) daily if the member would risk defaulting. The 801 basically makes HF’s and MM’s pay more if they are playing too risky and can let the DTCC liquidate the member’s positions if it could risk the NSCC’s ability to complete that day’s trades.

Edit: addition from [u/swimmerchild](https://www.reddit.com/u/swimmerchild/) \*Hi. This is a good thing. Basically they cant have a rule that says they have to report once a month and another that they have to report daily. It’s one or the other, and they just tossed out the monthly one

Edit 2: please direct any and all questions to [u/swimmerchild](https://www.reddit.com/u/swimmerchild/) This person is the true OP of this post.

Also the link where you can see when the new rule passes: [https://www.dtcc.com/legal/important-notices?pgs=1](https://www.dtcc.com/legal/important-notices?pgs=1)

&#x200B;

the fact that we are seeing changes is a good one in my book, how it will be implemented is something we will have to see how that turns out. I hope that we get some stricter regulations or better yet, remove the ability to short in total but that's just a pipe dream right now.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rmoxkli18dn61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d283bf92a8d17db5159ce51ff3d760e15d62e4d2

# Patience.

Ok so this is something I need to drive home, each and every day, at every step remember.

these guys wont play fair, they never did they never will.

we will see fuckery because lets be honest would you in their position?

March 19th has been marked in our calendar AND ALSO THEIRS! so expect the worst case scenario.

expect this to go down a lot, they'll try to destroy morale in every possible way, this is a literal war of attrition, not a race but a marathon.

This is NOT something that will come easy, this will separate the boys from the men as this is a very simple thing, relax sit back and learn some patience.

The only things we can do is grab the dips and hodl, that's it, they will flood the boards with Fud, they will try to make it look like this was all over and now well look at this other stock!

Just keep level headed, stay relaxed this is nothing more than waiting for it to go pop.

Because when GME hit's that shiny nice launch button there is nothing the hedgies can do.

The board can call an emergency shareholder meeting whenever they deem fit.

They can recall shares for a number of reasons, or do a reverse stock split or whatever.

Remember we have seen WEEKS of red, we have at this point grown accustomed to it, to the new people relax this is something you'll get used to, and if you get nervous look at the fundamentals. I believe in this company and I love the stock.

# Kill them with kindness.

Remember everyone please, be super nice, OVERLY nice to everyone here.

This has made it so easy to spot the Shills and the noobs get more help, making paperhands slowly turn to diamondhanded apes.

But suddenly we get a lot of people saying bad stuff about me Broviet Pixel and the entire mod team, funny how I wrote about it yesterday and it's already happening totally not expected 🙄🙄🙄

Remember: APE FRIENDLY, APE DONT FIGHT APE!

&#x200B;

Again as always none of this is financial advice I eat off brand crayons

&#x200B;

# Options

Ok this needs to be stated and everyone needs to get this through their ape skulls.

Options calls puts everything like that, you need to understand a 100% of what these mean and how they work, if you don't know everything about them BE CAREFULL.

Options are dangerous if you don't know how they work.

&#x200B;

Remember none of this is financial advice, just one idiot ape to another.

What’s up guys. Not looking for anyone to jump at me. I’m new and I have amc. I’m on the same boat as you with the same goal and hopefulness. 

But, as I’m inexperienced but I’m also not a space case, how and what do people justify this limit to go to? I understand “hold and don’t sell”, “there’s no limit if we hold”. I get it. I love it. 

But I know I read it everywhere and that’s all that ever really gets said. I’m all about 10k. But once people see it get to a pretty high number won’t it be hard to keep people from selling off. I won’t want to at all, but I fear it’s hard to justify. Anyone there that won’t try and be mean, but try and be real with me to understand a bit more of what I should actually or honestly expect if it ever moons? 

Again not looking to be called out. I know all the responses that someone can give. I’m on your team and hoping for the same. HOLD.",2021-03-31 22:15:35

Dr. Strangestonks or: How I learned to stop worrying and love the Market.,1616045397.0,"Alrighty people of earth, 

It’s about time we talk about predictions of the stock market. I’m really stoked on these stocks, hell, I love em. And I want to see them fly into oblivion, just like you. And I’m stoked that you love the stocks as well, good apes! But setting people up with false hope is shitty, real shitty.

We all want this thing to pop, fuck I’ve had a semi since January. But setting specific dates, price points and saying stock will move laterally off of a hunch is dangerous. I like the hype, we all do. But imagine getting into the stock market today, you buy a few shares of AMC and one GME. Then everyone on the internet is screaming that it’s going to the moon today, tomorrow, the 19th, next week. All we are doing is moving the goal posts, which can be scary for someone with zero experience. We are inadvertently creating paper hands with the newbies if we tell them without a doubt something is going to happen. We all have no idea what the pre market holds, what the day looks like or how after market will close. Especially with how much the hedgies and whales have been moving this shit around, the stock wiggles like a three legged cat on ice skating rink. 

If you are scared about holding, read the DD. If you are worried about the price ended lower than you expected, zoom out on the timeline, both stocks are killing it. But if you are a true ape, you will wait for the dips, hold and not sweat this shit. The money machine is still brrrrin’ its all good. 

Not only is the sub for apes that love both stocks, but it’s for the little chimps starting out. Answer each others questions, keep the morale up. Keep the hype going, but cut out this “iTs hApPenINg ToDAy!” Shit...
We will get there, when we get there.

This is not financial advice, I’m just an ape with my favorite crayons.

Now, I was wondering if there is an image that is shared representing all of us, Apes, fighting against HF etc. 
Ive seen few memes and images with astronaut apes holding diamonds etc.

I want to be able to share a single picture on my facebook thats says everything we are fighting for but is simple. Ape holding 2 diamonds(amc,gme) on the moon or rocketing. I only have a phone so I can't really make a nice picture that represent us.

If anyone as an idea following this and could share it with us and start spreading it. It could let people know our cause and ask question! When your share it on fb and 4-5 family members or friends ask you wth is that, well it already brings more attention to what is going around on the market.

Thank you for your help and I can't wait to see the results it can give!! Looking forward to be able to spread an image reliable to our cause!!
Cheers to all Apes hodling strong!

Three Scenarios...,1619573949.0,"TL; DR: Hold.  💎💎💎

It seems there are three potential scenarios unfolding here today...

1. They’re letting some air out of the tires. They’re slowly decreasing the pressure by keeping the price DOWN, but letting it rise incrementally to stave off those big hits.
2. They’re setting a bull trap which lets the stock rise but then they will crash it in an attempt to get current stockholders to sell and to deter new and future investors. 
3. They’re struggling to hold the lid on this pressure cooker they’ve created, and the stock is going up, up, and away. To infinity and BEYOND! 

Regardless of all that, in the end, IT DOES NOT FUCKING MATTER which scenario is actually unfolding because I am holding for all those little apes out there who can only afford a few shares. I am holding because I am disgusted by the grotesque and flagrant abuse of power and wealth in this world. I am holding because I have a right to buy and sell whatever stocks I please in this “free” and “fair” market. And I am holding because I LIKE THE GODDAMNED STOCK! So, there.
